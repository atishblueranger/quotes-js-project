This historical site was founded as a nunnery in 1580 and continues to function today. The monastery occupies a large area surrounded by imposing stone walls, resembling a fortress. Once restricted from public access, it has become one of the city's most popular tourist attractions and is considered a masterpiece of colonial architecture.",
