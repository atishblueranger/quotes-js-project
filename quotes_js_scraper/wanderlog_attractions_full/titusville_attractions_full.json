Nestled along Courtenay Parkway North, this charming spot offers visitors the chance to witness manatees in their natural habitat. While parking can be limited, the experience is well worth it. As you approach from the north, don’t let the NASA restricted area signs deter you; just keep driving for about eight miles until you spot the sign directing you to this serene location.",
