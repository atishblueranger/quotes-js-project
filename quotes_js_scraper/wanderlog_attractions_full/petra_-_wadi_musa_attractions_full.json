Inside the tomb, the exposed carved rock displays bands of extraordinary colors that create a surreal atmosphere. Although located slightly ahead of the Royal tombs, it is definitely worth visiting. The upper part of this tomb bears resemblance to the Treasury but has suffered erosion over time. This architectural masterpiece combines elements from both Nabataean and classical styles.",
