Designed by sculptor Francisco Rallo Lahoz, it features a central figure of Columbus surrounded by sculptures representing indigenous cultures from the Americas. The fountain's unique shape resembles that of Latin America when viewed from above, with water cascading down its facade to represent the northern coast of the continent.",
