Established in 768 A.D., it offers plenty of photo opportunities both inside and outside the pay area. The shrine's surroundings also provide numerous great spots for photography. The transfer of the national capital to Nagaoka-kyo led to the development of Naramachi as a temple town, with Kasuga Taisha becoming a prominent attraction.",
