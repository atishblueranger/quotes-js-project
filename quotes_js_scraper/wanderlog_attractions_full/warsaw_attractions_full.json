Visitors can easily find the button to activate the music and enjoy the melodies, although it might be challenging to hear in noisy surroundings. This creative idea has been well-received by artists and is a fantastic discovery while exploring Warsaw. One of these musical benches can be found near the monument to the Warsaw insurgents, adding an extra layer of charm to this historic location.",
