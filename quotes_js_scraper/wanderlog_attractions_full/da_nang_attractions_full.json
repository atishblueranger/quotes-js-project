        "detail_description": "Bún Mắm Bà Đông is a traditional southern Vietnamese dish believed to have originated in Soc Trang Province, located in the Mekong Delta. In central Vietnam, it consists of vermicelli, pork or roasted pork, vegetables, unripe papaya, peanuts and anchovy fish sauce. This dark fish sauce noodle soup resembles grilled pork vermicelli but uses barbeque pork with skin and a distinctively strong-smelling dark fish sauce.",
