Although time has taken its toll on this magnificent structure, visitors can still marvel at a solitary pillar that stands as a testament to its grandeur dating back to 550 BC. The remnants evoke curiosity about what this temple might have looked like in its prime.",

Despite this, the impressive historical site is worth visiting, especially in the evening when there are fewer crowds and a pleasant atmosphere.
