This iconic bishops' palace, located just behind the Basilica on Plaza de la Alameda, was gifted by locals to Bishops Moran and Delgado in appreciation for their role in constructing the grand basilica. The left wing of this stunning structure dates back to 1760-1767, coinciding with the basilica's construction period.",
