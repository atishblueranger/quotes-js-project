It is located near the confluence of Khlong Hua Ro and Khlong Mueang. The temple has historical significance related to King Naresuan, who restructured it and named it after an old blind woman who sheltered him without knowing his true identity. The main hall houses an unusual White Buddha image, creating a serene atmosphere.",
