    "detail_description": "The best views over Santiago are from the peaks and viewpoints of the Parque Metropolitano, better known as Cerro San Cristóbal. At 722 hectares, the park is Santiago's largest green space, but it's still decidedly urban: a funicular carries you between different landscaped sections on one side, while a teleférico (cable car) swoops you away on the other.\nA snowy white 14m-high statue of the Virgen de la Inmaculada Concepción towers atop the cumbre (summit) at the Bellavista end of the park. The benches at its feet are the outdoor church where Pope John Paul II said Mass in 1984. To get here, take a steep switchbacked dirt trail or the funicular from Plaza Caupolicán (where you'll also find a tourist info kiosk). Alternatively, enter the park from Pedro de Valdivia and board the teleférico.Other attractions on the hillside include the Zoológico Nacional; the Jardín Botánico Mapulemu, a botanical garden; the child-oriented Plaza de Juegos Infantiles Gabriela Mistral, featuring attractive wooden playground equipment and an interactive water fountain; and two huge public swimming pools, the Piscina Tupahue and Piscina Antilén. The small but perfectly landscaped Jardín Japonés (Japanese Garden) is just above the Pedro de Valdivia entrance.Near the top of the funicular is the Terraza Bellavista, where there are a few snack stands and extraordinary views across the city. The park lies north of Bellavista and Providencia and has entrances in both neighborhoods."

    "detail_description": "More than just a graveyard, Santiago’s Cemen­terio General is a veritable city of tombs, many adorned with works by famous local sculptors. The names above the crypts read like a who’s who of Chilean history: its most tumultuous moments are attested to by Salvador Allende’s tomb and the Memorial del Detenido Desaparecido y del Ejecutado Político, a memorial to the ‘disappeared’ of Pinochet’s dictatorship.\nTo reach the memorial from the main entrance, walk down Av O'Higgins, turning right onto Limay for another 200m until you find Patio Recoleta Norte."

    "detail_description": "Exposed concrete, stripped wood and glass are the materials local architect Cristián Undurraga chose for the stunningly simple Museo de Artes Visuales. The contents of the four open-plan galleries are as impressive as the building: top-notch modern engravings, sculptures, paintings and photography form the regularly changing temporary exhibitions.\nAdmission includes the Museo Arqueológico de Santiago (MAS; Santiago Archeological Museum), tucked away on the top floor. The low-lit room with dark walls and wooden floors makes an atmospheric backdrop for a small but quality collection of Diaguita, San Pedro and Molle ceramics, Mapuche jewelry and more."

Note, however, that only a fraction of items from the 10,000-piece collection are on display at any given time. Lighthearted temporary exhibits have ranged from a Michael Jackson tribute and a 'Back to the 80s' show to a fútbol-themed exhibit featuring athletic wear from the World Cup held in Chile in 1962. The airy on-site cafe is a fashionable spot for coffee or lunch.From Escuela Militar metro station, grab a taxi or take bus 425 from the east side of Américo Vespucio (you need a Bip! card) and get off at the intersection with Av Vitacura."

The compound was razed in the last days of Pinochet’s dictatorship – no doubt to conceal evidence of torture – but after the return of democracy it was turned into a powerful memorial park known as Parque por la Paz.\nEach element of the park symbolizes one aspect of the atrocities and visits here are fascinating but harrowing – be sensitive about taking pictures as other visitors may be former detainees or family members. Check the website ahead of time to arrange a guided tour. Take Transantiago bus D09 (you need a Bip! card) from right outside the Av Vespucio exit of Plaza Egaña metro station; it drops you opposite."

The permanent collection sometimes goes on tour and is replaced by temporary exhibitions, and there's a darkened room with an eerie display of Allende's personal effects. Guided tours (email ahead) sometimes visit the basement, where you can see tangled telephone wires and torture instruments left over from when the house was used by the dictatorship's notorious National Intelligence Directorate (DINA) as a listening station."
