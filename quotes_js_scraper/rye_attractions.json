Until 2017 this was a private house but with the tenants gone, the National Trust has opened up more rooms to the public and created a more hands-on experience. For budding writers there are writing spaces and courses on offer.\n"

You can scramble through the 13th-century building to learn about its long history as a fort, prison, mortuary and museum (the last two at overlapping times), and an annexe contains one of the last surviving Victorian women’s prisons in the country. From here, there are widescreen views of Rye Bay and even France on very clear days.\n"
