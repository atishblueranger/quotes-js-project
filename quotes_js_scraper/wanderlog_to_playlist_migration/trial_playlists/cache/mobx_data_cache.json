You cannot reach to the sea water as this is a man made bridge (road) to access the fishing boats. It is far better breeze and nice experience than Marina Beach. There is no sand in it just a road with stones and concrete blocks to safeguard the road.\n\nIf you are in a 2 wheelers, you can go till the end of the fishing harbour. Better to leave the place before sun set.\n\nMostly, local people will be in the beach.\nGovernment must think and improve the infrastructure and conditions of the entire place like a “Smart City”.

The crocodile are well taken care it's beautiful to visit with family. Tamil nadu government has been taking good care of the place. I visited from Mumbai with my family and it was best memory. People should visit such places for tourism and to know more about animals like crocodile.  Star rating would also fall less for I'm beyond speechless with my visit. Wish to visit them soon.."

History, Anthropology and children building components of museum are worth visiting.\nA library in the centre of museum is another well maintained spot.\nOverall excellent. Of course,we could see a part of presentations in 3 hours. Full viewing needs almost full day.\nOnly thing, which I found at the ticket counter missing was online mode of payment. In this age of technology, museum management must review mode of online payment at reservation counter in place of cash payment for purchase of tickets"

They don't accept any other mode of payment."

Unfortunately, the space suffers from poor maintenance. The aesthetics are far from inviting, and the information provided is neither clear nor well-presented, which takes away from the experience. At present, it feels more like a neglected public space than a celebrated cultural landmark. I sincerely hope the government takes steps to revitalize it, perhaps even by collaborating with private partners, so that this treasure can be preserved and appreciated as it truly deserves."

It will take about 4 hours to comfortably leisurely walk around everything and enjoy the exhibits and relax in a lively location between the buildings. I was glad to see paintings by Indian artists (though you can't take pictures in these halls), find a portrait of Gandhi, known from banknotes. I was also interested in watching the recreation of the life of ancient people and, of course, examining the building itself: doors, stained glass windows, roof. I recommend visiting!

The gopuram is stunning with its intricate carvings – you can spend quite some time just admiring the details. Inside, the temple has a very peaceful atmosphere despite being busy most of the time. the chants and lamps made it feel even more spiritual.\n\nThe area around the temple is also lively with small shops and traditional food stalls, which adds to the charm. Parking can be a bit tricky, and the crowd is usually heavy, but that’s expected at such a famous temple. If you’re in Chennai, this is definitely a must-visit, both for the architecture and the divine experience."

Whenever I visit chennai i make sure to go to this temple the aura the architecture the sculpture and the serenity of this hindu temple attracts me so much. Like Gorakhpur temple of UP here also I saw lots of idols of sadhus . Photography of idols is prohibited. This time i visited the temple early morning around 5 am still I could see good number of devotees there.  If visiting Chennai must go to kapaleshwar temple for darshan."

              "reviewText": "Kapaleeshwarar Temple, Mylapore — a classic Chennai landmark that feels timeless the moment you pass the towering gopuram. The nadaswaram and tavil during puja, the fragrance of jasmine and camphor, and the bustle around the temple tank create a beautiful, old-Madras vibe. Darshan usually moves smoothly; priests are courteous and the premises are kept clean with clear signboards and organized footwear counters. Visit early morning or around the evening aarti for cooler weather and fewer crowds (festival days—especially Panguni Peruvizha/Arubathimoovar—get packed). Dress modestly; photos are fine in the outer prakarams but avoid the sanctum. Parking is easiest around the tank streets.\n\nSecret tip: after offering at Karpagambal’s shrine, step to the Punnai (temple) tree and look up—you’ll spot carvings and imagery of the peacock tied to the temple’s legend. At sunset, walk the tank’s east side for the best reflection shot of the gopuram."

All sannadhis are visible from long itself which I feel so special. Even in heavy crowd can have a good view of Mulavar from outside itself . Idols of 108 Nayanmargal around Mulavaru gives you the divine vibe . Must visit in weekdays as it is lightly crowded even on Friday odd hours . Definitely in weekends or in special occasions temple will be heavily crowded . Must visit Temple OM NAMAH SHIVAYA 🙏"

The beach stretches endlessly and offers great views of the Bay of Bengal, especially during sunrise and sunset. The vast open space, sea breeze, and golden sand make it a peaceful spot to unwind—from a distance.\n\nThat said, the overall experience was mixed. While the beach is iconic and lively, it’s also not very well maintained in many areas. There’s noticeable litter on the sand, and even though clean-up crews are around, the volume of visitors makes it hard to keep up. Swimming is not advisable, as the currents are strong and there are no lifeguards clearly visible.\n\nFrom a tourist's perspective, it’s worth visiting early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid the heat and large crowds. Street food stalls line the stretch, selling everything from spicy sundal to corn and ice cream. While tempting, hygiene can be a concern, so be cautious. There are also vendors selling souvenirs, toys, and local crafts.\n\nParking is available near the beach but can be chaotic, especially on weekends. Public toilets exist but are basic and could be better maintained. Nearby attractions include Vivekananda House, light house, and some old colonial buildings that are worth a quick visit.\n\nMarina Beach is best enjoyed for a short stroll, photo ops, and people-watching—but don’t expect a pristine, relaxing beach experience."

The long stretch of golden sand, the sound of waves crashing, and the cool sea breeze make it a perfect place to unwind, especially during early mornings and evenings.

There was service going on in the sanctuary, although we didn’t understand the song, but the music was so calming. The night temperature was pleasant too, praise the Lord!"

Built over the tomb of St. Thomas the Apostle 🕊️—one of the 12 Apostles of Jesus—this Basilica is one of only three churches in the world built over an apostle’s tomb, alongside St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome and Santiago de Compostela in Spain 🌍.\n\nAt the ground level, there is a small but meaningful museum 🎨 displaying relics and items related to St. Thomas and the history of Santhome. You can see the lance head 🗡️ that pierced him, a rare bone fragment 🦴, his chair, stone receptacle, ancient coins 🪙, Persian medallions, monograms, multilingual inscriptions, and beautiful canvas paintings 🖼️. Each exhibit is well-described with explanatory plaques for context 📖.\n\nAbove the museum, there is a mini theatre 🎥 that screens a short documentary on St. Thomas and the history of the Basilica—informative and spiritually enriching.\n\nOne of the main attractions is the image of Our Lady of Mylapore 👑. This beautifully carved, three-foot-high wooden statue represents Our Lady seated in prayer. Believed to have been brought by Fr. Gaspar Coelho in 1543, this is the oldest and most beautiful statue of Our Lady in eastern India 🌹.\n\nThe Basilica is known for its daily services and peaceful ambiance 🌸. The church offers Holy Masses in both Tamil and English, making it accessible to all.\n\n📅 Mass Timings:\n\nWeekdays: 🕕 05:45 AM – Adoration & Rosary\n🕡 06:15 AM – Holy Mass (English)\n🕚 11:00 AM – Holy Mass (Tamil – Tomb Chapel)\n🕠 05:30 PM – Benediction\n🕕 05:45 PM – Rosary\n🕡 06:15 PM – Holy Mass (Tamil)\n\n🕯️ Eucharistic Adoration (Mon–Sat): 07:00 AM to 05:30 PM\n\nSundays: 🕕 06:00 AM – Holy Mass (Tamil)\n🕖 07:15 AM – Holy Mass (English)\n🕣 08:30 AM – Holy Mass (Tamil)\n🕙 10:00 AM – Holy Mass (English)\n🕦 11:30 AM – Holy Mass (English)\n🕠 05:30 PM – Holy Mass (English – Tomb Chapel)\n🕕 06:00 PM – Holy Mass (Tamil) followed by Benediction\n\n🕊️ Historical Note: Pope St. John Paul II visited this Basilica in 1986—the first ever papal visit to India.

              "reviewText": "Semmozhi Poonga, located in the heart of Chennai near the Government Museum and Egmore Railway Station, was envisioned as a modern urban park celebrating Tamil language and heritage. While the concept is commendable, the overall experience falls short of expectations, warranting a modest 2-star rating.\n\n**Ambience & Aesthetics (2.5/5):**\nThe park is built on reclaimed land that was once a degraded area, and its transformation into a landscaped garden is a step in the right direction. The name \"Semmozhi Poonga\" (Classical Language Park) reflects a noble intent to promote Tamil culture. There are thematic sections dedicated to Tamil literature and poets, along with sculptures and inscriptions. However, the maintenance is inconsistent—patches of dry grass, wilted plants, and unclean water features detract from the visual appeal. The garden lacks the vibrancy and lushness one would expect from a botanical or heritage park.\n\n**Cleanliness & Maintenance (1.5/5):**\nThis is where the park struggles the most. Littering is common, restrooms are poorly maintained, and there’s a noticeable lack of regular upkeep. Some areas feel neglected, with broken benches and faded signage. The fountains and water bodies often appear stagnant or non-functional, which is disappointing given the park’s central location.\n\n**Visitor Experience (2/5):**\nThe park is open to the public and is often frequented by families, students, and elderly visitors looking for a green space in the city. It’s relatively peaceful compared to busier parks, but the lack of engaging activities, play areas for children, or proper seating limits its appeal. Security and lighting are adequate during the day, but it's not recommended to visit after dusk.\n\n**Accessibility & Facilities (2/5):**\nLocated centrally, it's easily accessible by public transport. There’s a nominal entry fee, and security checks are in place. However, facilities like drinking water, clean restrooms, food stalls, and shaded sitting areas are either inadequate or poorly maintained.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSemmozhi Poonga has the potential to be a cultural and ecological gem for Chennai. Unfortunately, poor maintenance, lack of visitor engagement, and inconsistent upkeep bring down the overall experience. With better management and regular care, it could rise to its intended glory. As of now, it’s a decent spot for a quick stroll, but don’t expect a well-groomed or inspiring green space.\n\n**Rating: ★★☆☆☆ (2 out of 5)**\n*Recommended for: Casual walk, cultural curiosity. Not ideal for families or nature lovers seeking a serene environment.*"

Her initial mark sheet reflected everything correctly, including assignment submissions. However, when the consolidated mark sheet was generated, it falsely showed \"assignment not done.\" Despite the fact that it was submitted and verified earlier, the university failed to correct the error.\n\nI personally visited the university more than 20 times to resolve this, but nothing was done. Sadly, my wife is no longer with us, and it's heartbreaking to see this kind of negligence. If a university can not manage records properly or support its students and families, they shouldn’t be allowed to operate. It is completely unprofessional and irresponsible."

The mix of stores, the pathways to the different sections etc. are quite unique. If you have time, then a 'slowish' walk across the mall will be rewarding. However, if on a tight schedule please do check the location of the store and move there directly. On my last visit, I noticed that some of the larger stores had moved. This is a bit disturbing given the eccentric mix of stores seems to be out of balance i.e. the mix of traditional stores, large franchises and independent stores is now skewed. Regardless a great place to shop and/or wander around. Food options are better today but needs to improve."

The atmosphere here is a far cry from the glitzy, modern malls you find everywhere today. Instead, it feels more grounded, raw, and nostalgic. You’ll find narrow corridors, old signage, and a maze of local shops that give it real character.\n\nWhat makes it special is the mix of heritage and hustle. You can find everything from handmade Kashmiri rugs and leather goods to vintage electronics and quirky trinkets. It’s a treasure hunt more than a typical shopping trip. And while the facilities might seem outdated compared to Phoenix or Express Avenue, the charm lies in its imperfections.\n\nIt’s definitely worth visiting if you love history, want to support small businesses, or just want a break from the cookie-cutter mall experience. You won’t find global luxury brands here, but you’ll find soul and that’s rare."

As the longest natural urban beach in the country, it offers a picturesque setting with its silver sand, blue sea, and stunning sunrise and sunset views. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:\nUndercurrents: While the beach is beautiful, the undercurrents can be strong, making it challenging for swimmers. It’s essential to exercise caution and stay safe.\nKannagi Statue: Look out for the “Kannagi” statue, which tells the story of the legendary character from a South Indian epic. It adds a cultural touch to the beach experience.\n\nDuration: Plan to spend 2-3 hours at Marina Beach. Whether you’re taking a leisurely stroll, enjoying the sea breeze, or simply relaxing, there’s something for everyone.\n\nAmenities: Nearby, you’ll find amenities like parking, restaurants, and showers. These facilities enhance the overall experience for visitors.\n\nMarina Beach is a must-visit spot in Chennai, offering a blend of natural beauty, history, and local culture"

There is also skating park for kids.\n\nThe shops are clean and as it’s weekday not all shops opened. Overall a must visit beach in Chennai. Don’t miss this even if u miss Marina beach."

The beach is clean, the atmosphere is calm, and the streets nearby are filled with amazing street food that adds to the charm. The park area with its various rides is also worth exploring and makes the visit even more enjoyable. The only drawback is the presence of persistent beggars and vendors, which can be bothersome, so it’s good to stay cautious. Other than that, Besant Nagar Beach is definitely a must-visit destination in Chennai."

I’ve been visiting it regularly – both early in the mornings and late at night, and each visit has something special to offer.\n\n🌅 Sunrise at the beach is a serene and beautiful experience. The soft golden light, the gentle sound of waves, and the cool breeze instantly lift your mood. It’s the perfect time to go for a peaceful walk or just sit by the shore and soak in the calmness before the city wakes up.\n\n🌇 Sunset, on the other hand, brings its own charm. The sky turns into a canvas of oranges and pinks, and the atmosphere becomes livelier with people strolling, kids playing, and street food vendors lighting up the beachside. There’s something so refreshing and calming about the place, no matter what time of day it is. The moment you step onto the sand, you feel a sense of peace and lightness that only the sea can bring.\n\n🎉 One of the exciting things about Bessie is that they screen IPL matches on big screens during the season! It adds a vibrant community vibe, with people cheering, relaxing with friends and family, and enjoying snacks while watching the game in the open air with the sea breeze around.\n\nWhether you’re looking for quiet reflection during sunrise, chilling with friends in the evening, or even just grabbing a bite from the food stalls, Besant Nagar Beach never disappoints. It’s clean, lively, and safe, and has become a sort of personal escape zone for me within the city.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone visiting Chennai or even locals who haven’t made this part of their regular routine yet!"

Whether you visit at dawn, when the sky blushes softly, or in the evening under the moonlit glow, the place feels magical. The waves are lively but soothing, and the breeze carries that unmistakable salty freshness.\n\nThere’s a lively stretch near the shore with small stalls, local snacks, and the hum of people enjoying themselves, yet you can always find quieter corners to just sit and watch the ocean. The beach is perfect for long walks, photography, or simply letting time slow down while the waves kiss your feet.\n\nIf you’re in Chennai, Basant Nagar Beach isn’t just a spot—it’s an experience. 🌊✨"

It will be our day beautiful.\n\nDownside is the roads are narrow nearer to the beach and parking your cars is a bit of a challenge. However if you manage to travel through the crowd this is a place to enjoy!\n\nFeels like pondy rock beach in Chennai.. good spot to photoshoots, also a fresh fish fries and snacking. Compared to marina and bessn beach this will be the different experience.\n\nWe can purchase fresh fish on the spot from the sea as on time after 5pm everytime."

Established as the Madras Preparatory School on October 15, 1840 and later, upgraded to a high school and then, graduate college, the Presidency College is one of the oldest government arts colleges in India. It is one of the two Presidency colleges established by the British in India, the other being the Presidency College, Kolkata.. At the behest of Sir Thomas Munro, a Committee of Public Instruction was formed in 1826. In 1836, the duties of the Committee were taken over by a \"Committee of Native Education\". The plans drawn up by the Committee did not commend themselves to the Governor of Madras, Lord Elphinstone, who in turn proposed nineteen resolutions which were passed unanimously.[1]\nAs first Principal, the choice of Elphinstone fell on E. B. Powell, a University of Cambridge Wrangler in Mathematics, who accepted the post. Powell reached Mumbai (Bombay) on 20 September 1840 but did not arrive at Chennai (Madras) until 24 November, the journey from Bombay to Madras taking some four weeks. In the mean time, the Committee had invited a Mr Cooper, from the Hoogly College, Kolkata (Calcutta), to carry out the duties of Principal temporarily, at a salary of Rs. 400 a month. Cooper accepted the invitation and came to Chennai (Madras). He and his staff opened Presidency School, a preparatory school, in a rented building in Egmore known as Edinburgh Home on 15 October 1840. Cooper remained in the preparatory school for only a few months. Soon after Eyre Burton Powell's arrival and before the opening of the high school department in April 1841, he returned to Kolkata (Calcutta). The preparatory School was shifted to Popham's Broadway in 1841.[1]\nThe schools grew into Presidency College. When the University of Madras was founded in 1857, Presidency College was affiliated to it.[1]\nIn 1870, the college moved to its present location in Kamaraj Salai, opposite Marina Beach.. One of the best college in Chennai. Most of the Eminent people are studied here"

Within an hour, while we were at a nearby shop, the place got Crowded—seems like we picked the perfect timing! 📸 Got some good clicks too!\n\nI had visited this beach ages ago, but it has Developed significantly since then. Noticed some great improvements, like a ramp for the physically challenged ♿ and an increase in the number of shops. The beach is full of vibrant energy, with plenty of activities and games to enjoy. 🏖️🎈\n\nCompared to Marina & Pattinapakkam, this place has a unique charm for me—maybe a personal connection, who knows? 😄 Besant Nagar Beach feels quieter, cleaner, and well-organized, making it perfect for a Peaceful walk, reading, or simply enjoying the waves. 🌊✨ Definitely a must-visit spot!"

Don’t expect a well-maintained or lively beach experience—this is more of a local hangout spot with average cleanliness and basic facilities. Not recommended for those looking for a proper beach vacation."

From the moment you step in, you're transported into a winter wonderland with real snow, icy slides, and loads of fun activities. The temperature drops instantly, and it’s a refreshing change from the Chennai heat!\n\nThey provide all the necessary winter gear like jackets, boots, and gloves, which are clean and well-maintained. The snow play area is spacious and perfect for families, kids, and even groups of friends. The music, lighting, and overall vibe make it a joyful experience.\n\nThe highlight for me was the snow slide and the snowfall simulation – truly magical moments. Staff were polite, safety measures were in place, and everything was well organized.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a fun, chilly adventure without leaving the city. Perfect weekend getaway or birthday surprise idea too!"

From the moment we stepped in, it felt like being transported to a snowy mountain village — without leaving the city. The snow was real, soft, and fresh, and the temperature was just right to enjoy comfortably with the provided jackets,hand gloves and boots. Also they ensured it’s properly cleaned before giving to next visitor.\n\nThe space is well-maintained, clean, and very safe for families. There are plenty of fun activities like snow slides, snowball play zones, and even mini igloos for the little ones to explore. The staff were friendly, attentive, and made sure everyone was enjoying safely.\n\nOnly key improvement is needed in WASHROOM. Not happy with quality of cleanliness and standards set by VGP Management.\n\nAmple parking space available.\n\nPerfect for just experiencing snow in chennai. Highly recommended for some chilly fun and unforgettable memories!"

I feel that the temple needs so more cleaning and hygiene due to huge crowd and will work better than now. I really felt blessed to get a chance to visit these places.\n\nThe only thing I found about the priests, they are always into rush in any famous temples. Even though less crowd they always ask devotees to go out as fast as they can. But if you see positive sides then one of the best temple to visit in Chennai. Lovely."

Here's what stood out:\n\nHistory & Architecture\n\nOne of Chennai’s oldest surviving temples, originally built by the Pallavas in the 6th–8th century, then expanded by the Cholas and later Vijayanagara kings  .\n\nA proud Divya Desam, praised in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham by the Alvars  .\n\nFeatures classic Dravidian structure: towering Raja Gopuram, ornate stone pillars, 36-pillared mandapam, and detailed carvings  .\n\nMultiple Forms of Perumal\n\nCentral shrine houses Lord Parthasarathy (Krishna–Charioteer of Arjuna), unique with a moustache (“Meesai Perumal”) and holding only a conch (no discus), believed to bear Bheeshma’s arrow scars from Kurukshetra  .\n\nOther shrines honor Yoga Narasimha, Rama, Gajendra Varadaraja, and Ranganatha, making it a revered Panchamurthi sthalam  .\n\nMeesai Perumal & Variants\n\nThe moustached form is an iconic visual; during certain days of Vaikunta Ekadasi, he's shown without a moustache, symbolizing humility  .\n\nThe temple also includes a distinct shrine for Yoga Narasimha, with its own entrance and dhvajastambha  .\nPrasadam\n\nThe Ven Pongal served here is particularly sweet and rich, made with extra ghee and cashews—believed to soothe the deity's arrow wounds  .\n\nCommon temple prasadam like Puliyodarai is also loved by devotees  .\n\nLocation & Atmosphere\n\nSituated in the heart of Triplicane, just a few minutes from Marina Beach, yet it feels like a peaceful oasis  .\n\nReal devotees comment on its positive aura, dedicated priests, and well-maintained grounds  .\n\nFestivals & Events\n\nMajor celebrations include Chittirai Brahmotsavam, Vaikunta Ekadasi, and the Masi (February–March) Theppam (float festival) in the temple tank  .\n\nThe annual Ramanujar festival is significant—legend says his father performed a Putrakameshti yagna here and received the blessing that Ramanuja would be born  .\n\nSummary\n\nA divine blend of ancient architecture, living tradition, and deep Vaishnava devotion—this temple is high on my list for anyone seeking spiritual depth or historical richness in Chennai. The sight of Meesai Perumal, the serene tank, and the lusciously sweet prasadam make it unforgettable."

The intricate carvings on the pillars and walls tell tales from Hindu mythology, showcasing the exquisite craftsmanship of the Pallava and later Chola and Vijayanagara periods. The vibrant colors of the deities and the constant chanting of hymns create a serene and uplifting ambiance.\n\nWhat truly sets this temple apart is its unique dedication to five forms of Vishnu: Krishna (Parthasarathy), Rama, Ranganatha, Gajendra Varadaraja, and Narasimha. Each shrine is beautifully maintained, allowing devotees to offer prayers and admire the distinct iconography. The main deity, Lord Parthasarathy, with his iconic mustache and scars from the Mahabharata war, is particularly captivating.\n\nThe temple complex is surprisingly spacious and well-organized, making it easy to navigate. Don't miss the opportunity to witness the daily rituals and aarti, which are performed with great devotion and precision. The spiritual energy during these times is palpable.\n\nBeyond its religious significance, the Parthasarathy Temple is a living testament to South Indian heritage. It's a place where history breathes, art flourishes, and faith resonates deeply. Must visit temple in chennai."

There you can see the carving of a monolith rock. The place is nice and beautiful. However, I felt there were lots of people selling food and the place was losing its beauty. There is an entrance to the beach from this place at th back. It is so depressing to see that the whole place is so dirty. Left overs of food and plastic has ruined the place. Too many shops. The beach has lost its charm."

Please do not miss the Arumugam Temple that was excavated and lies just outside the chain fence in the north. The temple is closed off and can be circled. A wonderful discovery. If the gate to that area is closed, one could walk from the beach or from ECR.

              "reviewText": "I recently visited Vivekananda House and had an inspiring experience. The place is well-maintained and beautifully showcases the life and teachings of Swami Vivekananda. One of the highlights of my visit was the 4D VR show, which took us through Swami Vivekananda's powerful and spiritual journey in a truly immersive way.\n\nThe visuals, sound, and storytelling were amazing—it felt like I was walking alongside him through different phases of his life, especially his journey to the West and his speech at the Parliament of Religions in Chicago. It gave me a deeper understanding of his vision, thoughts, and contribution to Indian philosophy.\n\nOverall, it's a must-visit place for anyone interested in history, spirituality, or just looking for inspiration. I left the place feeling motivated and proud of our rich cultural heritage."

There are are couple of theatres inside the museum where his Chicago speech, his early life are been portrayed. It will take some time in order to visit the museum. There is also a mediation hall where you can sit and meditate which is described as the place where he used to meditate when he came to Chennai.\n\nThey do have a bookstore where they sell his books. The ticket charges ₹50 per head. They will also take a photo free of cost and can be downloaded from the link they provide."

I’ve been seeing this place from outside for more than 25 years, since my childhood, as it is close to my grandfather’s house. Whenever I go across Marina, this pink building always stands out and reminds me of its cultural and historical significance.\n\nThough many people visit inside for school trips, exhibitions, or spiritual visits to learn about Swami Vivekananda and experience peace, the outside itself has a charm. Recently, opposite Vivekananda House, they have started putting up a big screen for open-air Tamil movie screenings, where the crowd sits together to watch evergreen films. The atmosphere becomes lively, with nearby stalls selling hot crispy bhajjis, ice creams, seafood like fish and prawn, fried rice, sodas, and popcorn – giving a true Chennai beachside vibe.\n\nThis place beautifully balances heritage and modern leisure – inside for culture and spirituality, and outside for entertainment and food. Truly, Vivekananda House is not just a building but a symbol of Marina itself."

The highlight of our visit was the wave pool — the DJ kept the energy high, and we spent most of our time enjoying the waves and the water rides. Overall, a fun and refreshing day!."

Better to bring your own tshirt, shower cap.\n\nSmall birds park also there. You can feed them.\n\nIf you bring snacks and lunch with you can spend your whole day.

And it was lovely of the staff Ms. Sudha who was there to explain about the art forms and the books we are interested in.\nIt was a wonderful visit. Can’t wait to go back."

The food is absolutely delicious, and overall service is very good.\n\nHowever, there were a couple of drawbacks. The moment you enter the room, there is an unpleasant smell from the toilet, which seems to be a plumbing issue that really needs attention. Also, while the hotel is beachfront, the beach itself isn’t particularly great, so don’t expect that to be the highlight of your stay."

I was bit sick and was not able to eat anything when I reached the resort. Just seeing my dull face , Chef John understood I was not ok. His kindness shone through. With a warm smile, he made fresh Idiyappam and coconut milk specially for me and he made yummiest home style curd rice  showcasing a motherly touch that went beyond just cooking. His thoughtful gesture helped me recover quickly and I was all ok by evening. I am deeply grateful for his compassion and thought fullness. I could enjoy my birthday at the resort. Would love to visit again  for the peaceful Private beach and the yummy food and room facilities at the resort . Taj resorts that way hold special place in our hearts .."

The resort was spacious and greenish but the problem is the behaviour of securities. Managers were good but they have north india guys as securities they just treat us like trespassers. Wherever we go they follow us and question us. Only word they were taught was this is only for guest. We understand we might not have access to few places and that can be conveyed in decent way not like this. Management should train the securities to treat people in the equal way though they pay for premium rooms or they pay for party halls. They don't just visit free."

It has 5 kingdoms.\n\nAt the beginning, you will feel the entry fees is too high and it’s not worth it.\n\nBut as you enter the ocean and deep ocean kingdom, you will be fascinated by the variety of aquatic life.\n\nStar fish moving slowly…..Nemo fish living happily with sea animals.\n\nSharks….Sting Rays….Wow….It gets exciting.\n\nPlan to spend more time in ocean and deep ocean area.\n\nPhotography is bit expensive - Rs.350 per photo. Snacks like popcorn is expensive too.\n\nSince we went there near 4 pm, we were also fortunate to deep the scuba divers in the feeding show. Diver feeds all the big fish in a fascinating 10-15 minutes show.\n\nBook a day in advance to avail discounts.\n\nOne or two staff are helpful and they explain everything nicely. Try to stay with them and you will be amazed at the beauty of the deep sea."

The trainers were incredibly patient and professional. Before heading into the main pool, they spent around 30 minutes training me, helping me get comfortable with the equipment—especially breathing in and out through the mouth, which was a bit tricky at first.\n\nOnce I was ready, diving into the pool surrounded by sharks and bat rays was nothing short of thrilling. It genuinely felt like being in the real ocean, with the presence of these majestic and slightly intimidating creatures all around. It was definitely worth every rupee I spent!\n\nOne of the most fascinating parts was watching the team feed the fishes manually. They carried buckets of fish right up to the sharks and other species, feeding them with such confidence—it was a jaw-dropping sight!\n\nSpecial thanks to Prabhamani from the call center for her fabulous support, and indhu at the Marine Kingdom for being so helpful throughout. The entire scuba team deserves applause for making this a safe and exciting adventure.\n\nHighly recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique underwater experience!"

Speed was decent, but the steering effort was too much.\n\nSolo kart: Much better experience with smooth turns and good speed.\n\nWaiting time: ~45 mins\nPrices: Vary between weekdays and weekends.\n\nOverall, it’s a fun place to enjoy if you’re prepared for some waiting."

The track is fun, the vibe is energetic, and it’s a nice way to break out of routine and enjoy something different.\n\nOnly downside was the hygiene of the helmets—they really need a refresh because the smell was quite off-putting. Would definitely suggest they improve that.\n\nApart from that, it’s a solid spot for some friendly racing and a fun outing with your group. Would go again (maybe with my own helmet next time 😄)."

The staff clearly told us that the age limit is 10+ for adult karts, and we were 11 and 13 years old, so we thought it was all good. But then they suddenly changed the reason and said we can’t ride because our legs might not reach the brakes, which made no sense – we were clearly tall enough and even tried to show them.\n\nTo make it worse, they gave a kid’s kart to someone else who came after us and didn’t offer us the same option. No explanation, no proper reason. We were just made to sit in the twin kart, which wasn’t what we came for. Felt like straight-up favouritism and very unfair.\n\nWe went there to have fun but ended up feeling disappointed. The karts and track might be good, but the way the staff handled the situation was poor.\n\nNot a great experience – hope they treat all visitors fairly in the future."

However there are certain areas which needs to be improved.\n\n1) Food is very average. It is an non customisable menu. Buffet was served in a common area and more than 250+ people will have food with you during your slot. Good that they gave us seating in a row. Food is not good except very few items.. Chicken starter was soo hard. They give a very big menu, but reality it was not sumptuous.\n\n2) Our team was allocated a lawn area for our gathering. Only chair facility was there. No water facility available, which is very basic necessity."

The staff were courteous and ensured the event ran smoothly.\n\nThe ambiance of the resort is calm and refreshing, with plenty of open space and beach access that makes it ideal for both events and leisure.

If only they could maintain the place better, they could be on the way to compete with the big wigs.\nThey served the buffet on the table as the number of people were less. That being said I'd give food a definite 4 stars- 1 star less as nobody is perfect ever.\nThe swimming pool was functional and we spent a considerable amount of time at the pool. The changing rooms require an overhaul. The private beach was good but they could maintain the surroundings better and control the entry of stray cows there.\nThe indoor games area can have better lighting and be beautified a bit more for aesthetics.\nThe children's play area too needs a major overhaul to have the place functional and safe for kids."

The pool is medium in size and got very crowded few times throughout the day. Very few indoor games, no A/C in the games area. Small park attached with basic playing amenities for kids. Reception area is quite hot to be in as it is not A/Ced. Good location and nice clean beach attached to the property. Worth a visit."

Additional charges for using the pool, charging 100 for 2hrs is fine when compare to our local swimming pools inside the city. My kids were enjoyed in pool, park and beach. Provided free face painting washable was really nice, for kids and adults. Varieties are very less but worth for money since the charge is less compare to neighboring resorts.\nAll together it is good."

Even after booking the whole bay, random people were coming in and roaming around — we complained to the management but no one cared.\n\nMaintenance is the worst! For room cleaning, we had to call 4-5 times, only then someone would show up. Same with the lift — every single time it stopped working, we had to keep calling the operator again and again.\n\nAnd the worst part — during our event, the drainage near the food area was leaking!

Unfortunately, what we received was far from acceptable and caused significant inconvenience and embarrassment.\n\nDespite booking the entire venue, we were shocked to discover that other guests had also been accommodated, causing major discomfort and overcrowding. The basic promise of daily linen and towel changes was completely ignored—not even a single change happened during our stay. they have only one small lift can accommodate two people at a time, event that also not worked properly.\n\nThe washrooms were in terrible condition: water flow was extremely slow, taps were broken, and faucets didn’t function properly. Even worse, we were denied access to the large swimming pool that was clearly advertised as available for guests.\n\nOne of the most frustrating issues was the complete failure to supply drinking water in the rooms as promised. With 74 rooms booked, not even one refill was done throughout the stay.\n\nThe decoration vendor caused damages, but strangely, we were asked to pay for it by unrelated parties like the green coconut supplier—absolutely unprofessional and unfair.\n\nWe had also requested 3 wheelchairs for a large group of over 200 guests. Only one was provided, despite repeated reminders. We paid ₹60,000 per day for kitchen usage, yet it was poorly maintained, and the drainage area broke down during the event, leading to overflow and a horrible mess.\n\nStaff behavior was another low point—they were outright rude, used foul language in front of guests, and showed no sense of hospitality. Many rooms were dirty, had non-functioning air conditioning, broken power sockets, badly arranged furniture, and unwashed curtains.\n\nTo top it all, they promised 20 safety locks but didn’t hand over a single key. At the end, without delivering any of the promised services, they were aggressive and confrontational about payment.\n\nOverall, this was an extremely disappointing and unprofessional experience. We expected hospitality, but were met with negligence and hostility. Not recommended."

They did not have any other theme available either - we drove over 15 km for absolutely nothing. They only gave excuses and tried to make us go away.\n\nIncredibly poor customer service - wouldn’t recommend to anybody who wants to rest assured that they’ve made a booking and will be let in."

While this is a positive step, the mall still needs more new, attractive stores to truly regain its charm.

Cold chicken, half the menu not available, and the staff look tired and lost.\n\nThe whole place feels dead. Dirty walls, broken lights, and a weird smell everywhere. Most shops are closed. It feels like an abandoned building, not a mall.\n\nThe theatre is a nightmare. Drunk men were shouting, people were talking loudly on their phones, and others came just to eat and chat. No one watched the movie. No staff to control the mess. The screen and sound were bad too.\n\nThis place is a total waste of time. Feels more like a slum than a mall. Avoid it completely."

              "reviewText": "Today, I had the pleasure of visiting Chennai's iconic Chennai City Centre, one of the oldest malls in the city. As soon as I entered the mall, I was greeted by a vibrant and bustling atmosphere that immediately lifted my spirits. The Inox theater within the mall was a real treat, with its comfortable seating and top-notch sound system providing the perfect setting for an enjoyable movie-watching experience. What impressed me the most was the impeccable architecture of the mall, which seamlessly blended modern design elements with traditional touches, creating a unique and visually stunning space. Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the parking fee was only 50 rupees, making it convenient and affordable for visitors like me. Overall, my visit to Chennai City Centre was a delightful experience, filled with happy moments and fond memories that I will cherish for a long time.\n\nMy rating was\n\nAmbiance:4/5\nParking:4/5\nHygiene:4/5\nMaintenance:4/5"

              "reviewText": "After a long time, I visited Chennai City Centre. We initially went to shop at Zudio, but due to the heavy crowd, we skipped shopping there. Instead, the kids enjoyed a small car ride in front of the mall. Unlike my last visit, I noticed that there are very few shops operating in this mall now, with only the theatre still functioning. However, they still charge ₹40 per hour for car parking, which feels quite high considering the reduced number of shops."

Better to bring your own tshirt, shower cap.\n\nSmall birds park also there. You can feed them.\n\nIf you bring snacks and lunch with you can spend your whole day.

              "reviewText": "5 Star | A Fascinating Experience for Reptile Enthusiasts\n\nEntry Fee (Feb 2025):\n\nSnake Park: ₹30 per person\n\nCamera/Mobile Phone Charge: ₹20 (only for Snake Park)\n\nIguana Interaction Zone: ₹10 per person\n\nParking: Charged separately\n\nThe Chennai Snake Park, established in 1972 by renowned herpetologist Romulus Whitaker, is a unique attraction in Chennai, offering visitors an up-close look at a diverse collection of reptiles.\n\nPros:\n\n✅ Diverse Reptile Collection – The park houses not only various snakes (including King Cobras, pythons, and vipers) but also crocodiles, turtles, and iguanas.\n✅ Interactive Iguana Exhibit – Inside the park, there's a special iguana enclosure where visitors can touch and interact with the iguanas for an additional ₹10.\n✅ Shaded Environment – Unlike many outdoor attractions in Chennai, this park is well-covered with trees, making it comfortable to visit even in summer.\n✅ Adjacent to Guindy Children's Park – Since it's right next to Guindy Children’s Park, you can extend your visit if you're with family or kids.\n✅ Washrooms Available – Basic facilities like washrooms are present inside the park.\n\nCons:\n\n❌ Short Visit Duration – The park can be explored in 1.5 to 2 hours max, so it's not an all-day attraction.\n❌ Less Crowd, Limited Buzz – While this ensures a peaceful visit, those expecting a bustling environment might find it a bit quiet.\n\nOverall:\n\nThe Chennai Snake Park is highly recommended for snake and nature lovers, families, and those looking for an educational yet exciting experience. The well-shaded surroundings make it a good place to visit even in summer. While it’s not a full-day attraction, it’s definitely worth a visit if you're in Chennai!\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes, definitely!"

It was shicking to see people touching iguanas and picking up turtles. No staff was supervising the area. From a safety perspective too the Iguanas are potentially dangerous. They can bite, whip their tail and also spread salmonella when touched.\nThe varities of snakes in here is impressive. Also the Crocodiles - Gharial/Mugger/Cayman/Salt Water are magnificent to see."

The newer sections of the terminal offer better lighting, expanded seating, cleaner washrooms, and improved signage. However, parts of the airport, especially in the domestic terminal, still feel dated and can get overcrowded during peak hours.\n\nIn terms of amenities, the airport offers a decent selection of food outlets, both local and international, as well as a few duty-free stores and lounges. Free Wi-Fi is available, though the connection can sometimes be patchy. Security and immigration processes, while thorough, are known to be slow during busy periods, which can be frustrating for travelers.\n\nConnectivity to the city is fairly good, with options such as taxis, app-based cabs, and a metro station nearby, although the walk from the terminal to the metro could be more convenient, especially with luggage.\n\nOverall, Chennai International Airport is functional and steadily improving. With ongoing expansion projects, it has the potential to become a more efficient and comfortable travel hub in the coming years."

The architecture is beautiful, and the station is well-maintained despite the huge crowd it handles daily. There are plenty of food stalls, waiting areas, and essential facilities like clean drinking water and restrooms. Connectivity is excellent, with metro, buses, and autos available right outside, making travel convenient.\n\nHowever, the station can get extremely crowded, and during peak hours, it feels chaotic. Cleanliness is decent but could be better, especially in waiting areas. Another downside is the occasional delay in trains, which can be frustrating. Also, auto drivers outside tend to overcharge, so be cautious if you’re hiring one.\n\nOverall, Chennai Central is a well-functioning and historic station, but some improvements in crowd management and cleanliness would make the experience even better!"

For a city that deals with extreme heat and heavy passenger traffic, the station really needs improvement in infrastructure and basic amenities.\n\nA station of this importance deserves better upkeep and facilities."

The sheer size of the campus, combined with its rich biodiversity—including the famous deer population—gave it a unique charm.\n\nThe academic atmosphere was palpable, with brilliant minds engaged in research and learning, fostering an environment of intellectual growth. The infrastructure was top-notch, from state-of-the-art labs and libraries to recreational facilities that kept me active and engaged.\n\nOne of the best aspects of the experience was the sense of community. The students, faculty, and staff were all welcoming, making it easy to settle in despite being there for a short period. The hostel life was enjoyable, offering not just comfort but a chance to connect with people from different backgrounds.\n\nThe food at the mess was diverse and catered to a variety of tastes, ensuring I never felt out of place. Additionally, the extracurricular opportunities, including cultural and tech fests, added a dynamic flavor to the stay.\n\nOverall, the month I spent at IIT Madras left me with lasting memories of a holistic experience that blended academics, nature, and community living beautifully."

It is the Second major Railway Station of Tamilnadu, next only to Chennai Central.\n\nIt is built in Gothic Style of Architecture. It was the Head Quarters of S.I.R (South Indian Railways). It mainly caters to the Destinations in South Tamilnadu. Previously it was purely a Metre Gauge Terminal. Fastest Train of Metre Gauge System Vaigai Express (Chennai-Madurai) used to start from this Station.\n\nEgmore Station now has got 11 Platforms. Out of this 2 Platforms are for Suburban EMU Service and rest are for Long Distance Trains. Previously, this Station has the unique facility of Entering the Platform (right up to the Coach) which was not available anywhere in India. We can take our Car in Platform No:2 and take U turn and exit through Platform No:3. Now, this has become history.\n\nApart from Trains to South, now trains to Dadar, Kachiguda (Hyderabad), Kakinada and Jodhpur too start from this Station.\n\nStation premises is maintained neatly. For a long time, there were no Restaurent within the Station. Now there is A2B Restaurent which is a nice one. Escalators are also available in some Platforms.\n\nIn a nutshell, Egmore is not just a Railway Station. It has got so intertwined with the History of Chennai."

One of the major concerns is the lack of cleanliness, with an unpleasant odor throughout the premises. Additionally, there are no accessibility features such as escalators or elevators, making it extremely inconvenient for travelers with luggage, the elderly, or those with mobility issues. Carrying luggage up and down the old stairways can be exhausting. Given these issues, this station is not recommended as a starting point for your journey."

              "reviewText": "Though Egmore is an important station where all the south bound trains originate, it provides a horrible experience for those who come for picking up and dropping passengers. The recent changes around the station have taken away the small parking lot (which was already small and inadequate) at the entrance of the station. The alternate parking lot created a little ahead of the station is a big joke. Getting your car in and out of the so called parking lot will be a nightmare, that too if you are lucky enough in managing to get a vacant slot out of the 6 or 8 slots. If you leave your vehicle on the road because of urgency, the traffic police promptly puts wheel lock and charges fine. (The cop will start negotiating asking how much you are willing to pay and will warn you that it will be more than 1000 bucks if he goes the official route. However, be aware that the official fine for first time offence is 500 rupees and it will be 1000 if it is a repeat incident) . Even the vehicles entering for dropping off passengers do not have adequate space at the dropping zone and quite often there is a pandemonium in front of the station due to traffic snarls. On top of all these melee, the auto rickshaw drivers and porters fleece the passengers, not to miss their contribution to the ordeal."

From day one, he took the time to patiently address every concern, listen to even the smallest requests, and guide us through each stage of the treatment with clarity and empathy. His calm demeanor, depth of knowledge, and genuine care provided immense comfort and confidence—not just to the patient, but to our entire family. We are deeply grateful to him for being a pillar of strength during this challenging time.\n\nSupporting him was an outstanding team of doctors — Dr. Sivaram, Dr. Sivakumar, Dr. Banu, Dr. Kaviyarasi, Dr. Siddharth and Dr. Sendhil — who all contributed significantly to my mother’s care with professionalism, compassion, and precision.\n\nWe also extend heartfelt thanks to Mrs. Sasikala, who was with us every step of the way, managing meticulous follow-ups and offering reassuring support. Mr. Surya and Ms. Archana were equally helpful, always available and ready to assist with a smile.\n\nDuring the inpatient stay, the nursing team — Kaviyatharasi, Ashwini, Rajalakshmi, Sujitha, Vishnu, and Nisha — provided round-the-clock care with great attention and kindness. Their dedication ensured not only physical comfort but emotional reassurance. The physio, Mohamed, played a key role in the patient's quick recovery and boosting their confidence.\n\nThe dietitians, Jayalakshmi and Meenakshi, created personalized and thoughtful meal plans, and the catering team deserves appreciation for delivering meals that were both nutritious and enjoyable — always on time.\n\nWe’re thankful to the porters, especially Sarfaraz and his team, for moving patients with care and respect. The patient care team, led by Lakshmi, helped make the environment feel more like home, providing warm and consistent support.\n\nThe admissions team (Durga Devi & team) and the insurance team (Shiva, Angel & team) were extremely helpful in simplifying complex processes and ensuring we had all the information we needed.\n\nFinally, the security team deserves praise for their vigilance and discipline. Their strict protocols on visitation are done with the patient’s best interest in mind, and we truly appreciate their role in maintaining a safe and infection-free environment.\n\nTo the entire MGM Cancer Institute team — and most especially to Dr. Srivishnu — thank you for not just treating the illness, but for healing with heart, dedication, and humanity. We will always remain grateful."

The entrance is extremely narrow and typically full of pedestrians during rush hour so good luck finding a way in or out of the metro parking. With the aforementioned foot traffic there is only one foot overbridge which quickly gets crowded, another is desperately needed. A new terminal building is being constructed which hopefully will address the entrance problem but as it stands, the station infrastructure is totally inadequate for the ridership."

Keep an eye out for the ongoing upgrades lunder the Amrit Bharat Station Scheme – a testament to its vital role.

Seven of us roamed the waters for three days in search of royal Bengal tiger.\nIntroduction:\nSunderbans is an Indian national park, tiger reserve and biosphere reserve. 37% of Sunderban are in Indian side and 63% in Bangladesh side.\nThe name itself suggests the romantic meaning of\n\"Beautiful forest\". It is on the delta area in bay of Bengal covered by mangrove. It covers an area of 4260 square kilometers. It was declared Tiger Reserve in 1973 and WS in 1977. In 1984 it was declared a NP. In 1987 it was inscribed UNESCO world heritage site. In 2019 brought under Ramsar site.\n\nActivities:\nDay 01:\nWe boarded the boat Delta Queen in Godkhila. We traversed the waters of river Gomti and entered open waters which was banked by thick mangrove and rich tiger palms.  First day we went to Sudhanyakhali and watched many colourful birds. We also spotted and photographed water monitor lizard getting into the water to prey on small fishes. On the banks of open waters we saw crocodiles and leucastic crocodile.. Over the lush green tops we spotted a number of birds. Five types of kingfisher which can be spotted during winter were seen.\nBlack capped kf\nCommon kingfisher\nPurple sunbird\nOriental white eye\nSerpent eagle\nPergerine falcon\nCrocodile\nDeers\nRhesus monkeys\nGreen bee-eaters\nAt night we docked near a village and went out for owl spotting. We saw long tailed night jar, spotted owlets and barn owl.\nDay 2:\nWe floated along the canals and reached camp Dobonk. We carefully looked out for tiger but couldn't see. We sighted more birds\nCollared kingfisher\nCommon kingfisher\nWhitethtoaed kingfisher\nLeucastic crocodile\nStriated heron\nPond heron\nAdjutant stork\nPurple heron\nSecond day there was less activity on the banks and the mood in the boat was also less cheerful\nDay 03:\nWe all were slightly disappointed since we couldn't sight the RBT for which the Sunderbans are famous. Suddenly the guide called out \"tiger\" and bingo! We saw to our left the elusive RBT looking straight at us. Eventhough half her body was hidden by the shrubs we could estimate her being huge. The mood on the boat turned somber and every one clicked Her Royal Majesty. Exactly after one minute, she turned her back on us and disappeared from view. It was and still is like a dream.  The date and time 15.12.2019 11.32 AM is etched in our memory\nAccommodation:\nThe boat the NG booked was sturdy and spacious. Living quarter  was in the lower level. The upper deck was provided with comfortable chairs, a huge teapoi to keep the cameras, field guides and other things.\nGuide: mr. Mrithunjaya Mondal was very knowledgeble, patient and explained everything. He was fluent in English\nFood:\nFood was prepared on board. Both veg and non-veg was available. It tasted good and was prepared in a hygenic way.\nService:\nThe staff were helpful, cooperative and courteous.\nOn the whole it was an once in a life time experience. Hats off to NG."

I've subsequently been to multiple expeditions with them - Tadoba, Nilgiris, Ranthambore, Gir, Valparai and Sundarbans and the experience keeps getting better every time.\n\nDuring wildlife safaris, what's very important is to get a good guide - and Naturographers ensures we get one. During the Gir Trip, our guide Salim bhai helped us sight 6 lions, 5 lionesses and 4 cubs - while there were others who couldn't spot even 1 during a Safari.\n\nSimilarly we spotted the elusive tiger during our Sundarbans trip thanks to our expert guide.\n\nThanks team for igniting this passion of wildlife photography in me and also getting to make lifelong friends from these adventures!"

The station is spacious, with twin platforms and a 3,200 m² basement parking area, and is part of the iconic “Parakkum Rail” elevated line  .\n\nThe ambience is a mixed bag: the high ceilings, occasional wall murals, and views of the canal give a futuristic, open feel—some even call it \"Hollywood-esque\"  . It’s serene and uncrowded during off-peak times, ideal for calm waiting  . However, those high ceilings and broad platforms also can feel deserted, and parts suffer from poor upkeep—lighting is sometimes dim, escalators or lifts often don’t work, and there's an occasional musty odor  .\n\nIn terms of security, the station has minimal RPF presence and limited police patrols. While major incidents are rare, commuters—especially women—have reported feeling uneasy, particularly during non-peak hours  . One user shared:"

              "reviewText": "Kasturbanagar Railway Station is a modest but efficient transit hub that serves the suburban regions of Chennai. Here’s a detailed review based on its key features:\n\nLocation and Accessibility.\nKasturbanagar Railway Station is strategically located in a residential area, making it easily accessible to commuters living nearby. The station is well-connected by local roads and public transport, ensuring convenience for daily travelers. However, parking facilities are limited, which might pose a challenge for those driving to the station.\n\nFacilities.\nThe station offers basic amenities to meet the needs of its users. There are sheltered waiting areas and seating arrangements, though they can become crowded during peak hours. Cleanliness is generally maintained, though occasional lapses have been noted. There are no extensive dining options, but small vendors nearby cater to light refreshments and snacks. The absence of escalators or elevators may be inconvenient for senior citizens and people with disabilities.\n\nConnectivity.\nKasturbanagar serves as a stop for Chennai's suburban train network, providing excellent connectivity to key parts of the city. Trains are frequent and mostly punctual, making it a reliable choice for commuters. However, the limited number of long-distance trains stopping at this station might not appeal to intercity travelers.\n\nSafety and Security.\nThe station has adequate lighting, and the presence of station staff adds a sense of security, especially during evening hours. CCTV cameras are installed for added surveillance, though the lack of visible police patrols might concern some passengers.\n\nOverall Experience.\nKasturbanagar Railway Station is a functional and practical station that caters to the daily needs of suburban commuters. While it lacks the advanced facilities of larger stations, its simplicity and efficiency make it a vital part of Chennai’s rail network. Improvements in accessibility and facilities would enhance the overall experience."

However, nestled within this urban landscape are serene escapes that offer a breath of fresh air and a chance to connect with nature. One such gem is Guindy National Park, the smallest national park in the country, where you can wander among lush greenery and encounter a variety of wildlife, including over 130 species of birds and playful mammals. This tranquil oasis not only provides a perfect retreat for nature lovers but also features a delightful play area for children, making it an ideal spot for families looking to unwind amidst the hustle and bustle of city life.\n\nJust a stone's throw away from Guindy National Park lies the Chennai Snake Park, a fascinating destination that showcases a diverse collection of reptiles, including snakes and crocodiles. This family-friendly attraction complements the natural beauty of the park and serves as a vital conservation site. As you explore these parks, you'll also find significant landmarks like the Gandhi Mandapam, which pays tribute to India's independence. With so much to discover, Chennai's national parks offer a unique blend of adventure, education, and relaxation, inviting you to step away from the city's fast pace and immerse yourself in the wonders of nature.",

I had to park in mud and struggled to exit—a guard set the fee, but no proper system or shelter.\n\nThe beach area is tight and congested, especially during evenings. Space to walk, sit, or play is limited.\n\nThe shoreline has noticeably narrowed—sea erosion seems to have taken over the sand, reducing usable area.\n\nWaste and debris are common, especially after high tides. There’s no visible cleaning schedule or waste management system.\n\nFew signboards or markers to guide visitors on safe zones, entry points, or amenities.\n\nNumerous resorts and restaurants line the edge, but prices are high, making the experience feel more commercial than relaxing.\n\nSafety feels uneven—lifeguards are present only at the main beach, leaving parts of the shore less monitored.\n\nThe narrow access roads are often crowded or uneven, making approach and exit difficult.\n\nPositive aspects to highlight:\n\nThe location is scenic—where backwaters meet the sea; gentle tides often make it suitable for dolphin spotting.\n\nEarly mornings and off-peak hours offer calm, peaceful views and a quieter stretch to enjoy.\n\nA few local vendors sell light bites such as fried banana or chilli—simple and tasty.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\nCreate organized, secure parking with shade or paved surfaces—and consider validating or waiving fees for visitors.\n\nIncrease frequency of beach cleaning crews and establish designated waste bins to manage both tidal and on-site debris.\n\nInstall clear signage and maps to guide visitors to access points, seating areas, restrooms, safety zones, and lifeguard-watched areas.\n\nExpand the beach footprint or undertake erosion control measures to restore walking and leisure space.\n\nOffer affordable lounge spaces or shaded seating for families and groups, separate from high-cost resorts.\n\nConsider extending lifeguard coverage to broader areas or offering beach safety warnings during peak hours.\n\nOverall recommendation:\nCherai Beach has charm and potential, especially for early-morning strolls or a quick getaway. However, the current experience is hampered by parking hassles, limited space, unclear safety measures, and inadequate cleanliness. With basic infrastructure upgrades and better visitor guidance, it could become a much more welcoming destination.\nod experience."

There’s a lovely beachside restaurant wave restaurant where you can relax, eat, and enjoy a stunning view of the waves.

In these quieter months, the beach offers a restful escape—calm, uncrowded, and perfect for reflective strolls or taking in the gentle lull of coastal life.\n\nThe atmosphere is defined by the soft murmur of conversations, the distant ebb of waves, and the rhythmic dance of Chinese fishing nets silhouetted against the sky. The locals, known for their genuine warmth and easygoing nature, add a welcoming touch—friendly interactions feel natural, uncomplicated, and heartfelt.\n\nFor an evening visit, Fort Kochi Beach proves particularly rewarding. As the sun inches toward the horizon, it paints the sky and sea in hues of gold and rose, making the waterfront a must-visit for those seeking tranquil beauty. Nearby, a collection of modest stalls and cafés provide delightful culinary fare—fresh seafood, traditional snacks, and refreshing coconut water—perfect companions to an evening well-spent by the water’s edge.\n\nWhether you're visiting solo, with friends, or as a couple, Fort Kochi Beach blends tranquility, scenic charm, and genuine hospitality in an atmosphere that’s both soothing and intimate—making it an excellent choice for spending quality time in a quiet coastal setting.\n\n---"

I went there without expecting much, but the vibe is something else. The Chinese fishing nets lining the shore feel like a living postcard. Watching fishermen work as the sun dipped low was oddly calming.\n\nThe walkway has this slow, unhurried rhythm—people selling local snacks, couples walking hand in hand, kids chasing waves. Sure, the beach could be cleaner in some spots, but it still holds a quiet charm, like an old story that hasn’t been fully told.\n\nIf you're looking for a touristy beach with water sports and loud music, this isn't it. But if you want to feel a little history, a little culture, and a lot of salt in the air—Fort Kochi Beach is worth it. Sunset here? Absolutely magical. ❤️"

As the first light of dawn caresses the rippling waters, a symphony of colors unfolds, painting the sky with delicate shades of pink, orange, and gold. The river, a liquid mirror, reflects this celestial spectacle, creating a seamless merger of earth and sky. The air is imbued with a gentle warmth, carrying the fragrance of blooming flowers and the earthy scent of damp soil.\n\nSilhouettes of trees stand tall against the emerging light, their branches adorned with dew-kissed leaves that glisten like diamonds. The soft whispers of the morning breeze add a melodic undertone to the scene, a gentle accompaniment to the chorus of waking birds that fill the air with their jubilant songs. The river's current, a rhythmic dance, flows gracefully, embracing the riverbank in a serene embrace.\n\nAs the sun ascends, its golden rays reach across the landscape, casting long shadows that gradually retreat with the advancing day. The play of light and shadow creates a dynamic tapestry, unveiling hidden details and transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary. On the riverbank, the world seems to pause, inviting contemplation and appreciation for the timeless beauty of this riverside sanctuary at sunrise."

              "reviewText": "Visited July 12, 2025 – Day 9 in India\n\nAfter our time in Jew Town, Peter brought us to the Dutch Palace, also known as Mattancherry Palace. From the outside, it looked modest, but once we stepped through the doors, it felt like walking into another time. Built by the Portuguese and later renovated by the Dutch, the palace was a gift to the local king of Cochin and now holds centuries of royal history.\n\nInside, the rooms were cool and quiet, with wooden ceilings, glossy black floors, and walls lined with paintings, murals, and artifacts. Our daughters, ages 5 and 7, were immediately curious and alert, taking it all in with wide eyes. Peter guided us through the palace room by room, bringing everything to life with stories, context, and thoughtful explanations.\n\nOne room had a striking portrait of a king. As we moved across the space, our girls noticed something uncanny—his eyes seemed to follow us wherever we went. They were both fascinated and slightly spooked. Peter explained that this was intentional, meant to reflect the king’s power and presence, even in painted form. The girls kept checking back, whispering, “He’s still watching,” with a mix of awe and amusement.\n\nThe murals in the palace were extraordinary—huge scenes from the Ramayana and Mahabharata, painted in natural dyes that have somehow lasted hundreds of years. They were full of color, emotion, and movement. Our daughters had endless questions: “Who are those people?” “Is that a god or a king?” Peter answered everything with such kindness and clarity. His ability to engage with them made all the difference.\n\nThen we came to a display of royal palanquins, used to carry members of the royal family. One of them was especially grand—beautifully carved and covered in ivory. Peter told us it was used in royal ceremonies and considered a symbol of status and power. The craftsmanship was remarkable, and it was easy to imagine the kings and queens riding inside, held aloft by their attendants.\n\nBut standing in front of that palanquin became an unexpectedly emotional moment. Earlier in the trip, we had told our daughters that ivory comes from elephant tusks. Now, seeing it up close, they made the connection. One of them asked, “Did an elephant die for this?” and the next question followed: “How many elephants were killed to make all this?”\n\nThey weren’t angry, just thoughtful—and visibly sad. We tried our best to explain that this was made long ago, in a time when people didn’t fully understand the consequences. Peter gently added that things are different now, and there are strong protections in place for elephants today. It was a quiet, powerful moment. A reminder that travel doesn’t just show you the world—it also teaches compassion.\n\nWe finished our visit feeling reflective. The Dutch Palace wasn’t just a place of history and beauty—it was layered, complicated, and deeply human. The painted kings, the stories on the walls, the opulence of royal life, and the real cost of some of that splendor—all of it stayed with us.\n\nOur daughters left still talking about the murals, the royal traditions, the palanquins, and yes, the king whose painted eyes never seemed to stop watching. It was one of the most meaningful parts of our day in Fort Kochi, and a visit we’ll remember not just for what we saw, but for how it made us feel."

The parking area inside the compound was muddy and uneven, which proved inconvenient—especially in wet weather. Inside, the murals and displays appeared faded and dusty, suggesting that maintenance is overdue. Additionally, there were no guides or explanatory support available, which made it difficult to understand the historical context behind what we were seeing. With better upkeep and some visitor-focused improvements, this remarkable heritage site could offer a much more fulfilling experience."

The architecture is a graceful fusion of traditional Kerala style (Nālukettu) and colonial Dutch influence, offering a visual treat for history and art lovers alike.\n\nConveniently located just behind the Paradesi Synagogue, the palace is easy to access as part of a heritage walk through Fort Kochi and Jew Town. The entry fee is a mere ₹5 per person, making it one of the most affordable heritage sites in the region—though it leaves one wondering how such a modest fee manages to support the upkeep of this cultural treasure.\n\nInside, the palace hosts an extraordinary collection of Travancore-era murals, depicting scenes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata, and other mythological themes in exquisite natural pigments. You'll also find a fascinating display of palanquins, royal costumes, swords, coins, and historical documents—offering an insightful window into the life and legacy of the Kochi royal family over nearly two centuries.\n\nPhotography enthusiasts will find endless inspiration here, from the mural-draped walls to the quiet charm of its wooden ceilings and tiled courtyards. The serene atmosphere, combined with historical depth, makes this palace not just a monument, but a narrative of Kerala's regal and colonial past.\n\nA must-visit landmark in Mattancherry—rich in history, culture, and timeless beauty."

It holds a rich history and plays a significant role in the economic and cultural landscape of the region.\n\nThe island was created during the early 20th century by the British colonial administration by reclaiming land from the backwaters of Kochi. It was named after Lord Willingdon, the British Viceroy of India at that time. Initially intended for use as a military base and for trade purposes, Wellington Island soon evolved into a bustling hub of commerce and industry.\n\nToday, Wellington Island serves as a vital commercial and industrial zone, housing the Port of Kochi, which is one of the largest and busiest ports in India. The port facilitates trade and commerce not only for Kochi but also for the entire state of Kerala, playing a crucial role in the region's economy. Its strategic location on the Arabian Sea makes it a gateway for international trade, connecting Kerala to various parts of the world.\n\nApart from its economic significance, Wellington Island is also a popular tourist destination. It boasts several attractions that draw visitors from far and wide. The Bolgatty Palace, located on the southern tip of the island, is a prime example of colonial architecture and offers a glimpse into Kerala's rich cultural heritage. Converted into a heritage hotel, the palace attracts tourists seeking a luxurious stay amidst historical surroundings.\n\nAnother notable landmark on Wellington Island is the Cochin Port Trust Guest House, which offers panoramic views of the harbor and the city skyline. Visitors can enjoy the serene beauty of the backwaters while relishing delicious Kerala cuisine at the island's numerous restaurants and eateries.\n\nIn addition to its commercial and tourist appeal, Wellington Island is also a hub of cultural activities. It hosts various events and festivals throughout the year, showcasing Kerala's vibrant arts and traditions. The Kochi International Marina, situated on the eastern shore of the island, provides a venue for water sports enthusiasts and sailing enthusiasts to indulge in their passion.\n\nFurthermore, Wellington Island is well-connected to the mainland and other parts of Kochi through road, rail, and water transport. The presence of major roads and bridges facilitates easy access, ensuring smooth connectivity for commuters and tourists alike.\n\nIn conclusion, Wellington Island stands as a testament to Kochi's rich history and vibrant present. From its humble origins as a reclaimed piece of land to its current status as a bustling commercial and tourist hub, the island continues to thrive and evolve. Whether it's for business, leisure, or cultural exploration, Wellington Island offers something for everyone, making it an integral part of the fabric of Kochi."

Though the beach was quite crowded and parking was a bit tricky (we had to use paid parking), it didn't take away from the overall experience.\n\nWe reached around 6 PM, and the timing couldn’t have been better. The evening breeze, golden sunlight, and the sound of waves made for a really calming and scenic environment. The highlight of the visit was definitely the floating bridge. It costs around Rs. 120 per person, but it’s absolutely worth it. Walking over the waves on a gently swaying bridge while watching the sunset was a unique and memorable experience—it truly elevated our time at the beach.\n\nWhether you’re there just to relax, enjoy the breeze, or take in the view, Kuzhuppilly Beach is a great spot. Definitely recommend it for an evening visit!"

The soft golden-white sands, cool breeze, and line of trees (especially the pine trees) add to its natural beauty.\n\nCompared to Fort Kochi Beach, I’d prefer Kuzhuppilly any day for a calm and refreshing outing. It’s ideal for family picnics, quiet walks, or simply enjoying the breeze. Swimming is possible, but do so at your own risk as there are no lifeguards around.\n\nOne of the highlights was the floating bridge (₹120 per person), which lets you walk gently over the waves. It’s a unique and unforgettable experience.\n\nThere’s a small parking fee, and though parking can be a bit tricky during peak hours, it’s manageable.\n\nHighly recommended if you want to enjoy nature, spend quality time, and forget the passing hours"

It's amazing that this 500-year-old church is still standing so tall and strong! The interiors definitely have that classic Portuguese feel. We visited as they were closing for lunch, so we didn't get as much time as we'd have liked. It's also conveniently located near the Cochin Water Metro, making it easy to get to from the main city."

Originally buit by Portuguese in 1505, and elevated to cathedral by Pope IV in 1558. It's not only a place of deviation, but also a historic significance with architectural and artist grandeur. It's ceiling is made of wood and has beautiful paintings on it. The peaceful ambiance inside the cathedral make it perfect spot for quite contemplation and reflections. Lot of devotees go to visit the church to pray for favours who lost lives, may their soul to rest in peace. There are restrictions about visitors timing. Please keep it in your mind that it is a place of God, so maintain it's dignity.\n\nWheelchair accessible parking and entrance available."

Originally consecrated by Portuguese, but mostly destroyed during Dutch conquest of Kerala, the Cathedral still stands as one of the most iconic and oldest churches of Kerala. I visited it during afternoon, and it was closed, but I got to admire it's architecture."

              "reviewText": "Mangalavanam Bird Sanctuary (മംഗളവനം പക്ഷി സങ്കേതം) is a peaceful green haven located in the heart of Kochi, Kerala. Despite covering just 2.74 hectares, this urban sanctuary plays a crucial ecological role, often referred to as the \"green lungs of Kochi.\" Surrounded by the bustling city, it provides a serene escape into nature, rich in biodiversity.\n\nHighlights and Biodiversity\n\nMangalavanam is home to over 70 species of resident and migratory birds. Notable species include the brahminy kite, common redshank, greenshank, marsh sandpiper, and white-breasted waterhen. In addition to birds, the sanctuary supports species of mammals like the Indian flying-fox, painted bat, otters, and palm squirrels.\n\nThe mangrove ecosystem also supports amphibians like common Indian toads and cricket frogs, along with fish species such as climbing perch and swamp eel. The sanctuary is also known for its butterfly population and an impressive diversity of spiders.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nThe ideal time to visit Mangalavanam is from December to March, especially in January and February when migratory birds are most active. The weather is pleasant, making it suitable for long walks, birdwatching, and photography.\n\nVisitor Information\n\nOpening Hours: 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM (daily)\n\nEntry Fee: Free of charge\n\nFacilities: There’s a watchtower that offers panoramic views of the sanctuary and its lake, along with eco-awareness boards and nature trails.\n\nGetting There\n\nBy Road: Located in Ayyappankavu, Kochi, it is easily reachable via taxis, autos, or public buses.\n\nBy Train: Just 4 km from Ernakulam Junction railway station.\n\nBy Air: About 30 km from Cochin International Airport.\n\nConclusion\n\nMangalavanam Bird Sanctuary is a rare and vital green pocket within a modern city. It not only provides a shelter for birds and wildlife but also serves as a place for peaceful reflection and ecological learning. For bird lovers, nature enthusiasts, and urban explorers, it offers a quiet but meaningful experience amidst the chaos of the city."

There are a lot of mosquitoes, which can be a concern. The atmosphere is very forest-like, offering a natural and peaceful setting, but it may not be ideal for a family outing. If you’re looking for a quiet, nature-filled experience, this could be a good choice, but I wouldn’t recommend it for families.”"

Watching the fishermen operate these traditional nets is fascinating, and the whole atmosphere along the waterfront feels vibrant. They even allowed us to help pull the fishing net, which was such a unique and memorable experience. Fresh catches are often sold right there, adding to the charm. A must-visit spot in Fort Kochi for history, culture, and an authentic local vibe."

              "reviewText": "Visited July 12, 2025 – Day 9 in India\n\nWe visited the Chinese fishing nets in Cochin as part of a walking tour with our guide Peter, and it turned out to be one of the highlights of our trip. Peter was fantastic—friendly, clear, and incredibly knowledgeable. He brought the experience to life for us and made sure we truly understood what we were seeing.\n\nHe guided us to the Chinese fishing village, where we got to watch the traditional fishing nets in action. These large wooden structures are operated entirely by hand, using ropes, weights, and a team of six fishermen. It was amazing to learn how they carefully lower and raise the nets every few minutes, hoping to catch fish, crabs, and shrimp. Peter explained that each group can catch up to 100 kilograms of fish daily, and watching them work together with such precision was fascinating.\n\nWe were even allowed to peek into the baskets where the fresh catch was sorted. My 5- and 7-year-old children were thrilled to spot shrimp and tiny crabs. Their excitement was contagious, and it was such a fun and educational experience for them.\n\nAfterward, we walked through a lively row of local seafood vendors. The fish was fresh, the variety was impressive, and the prices were very fair. It was wonderful to see the local economy at work and to interact with the people who make this daily rhythm possible.\n\nThe only reason I’m giving four stars instead of five is because of the cleanliness. The shoreline and surrounding areas could use more attention. There was quite a bit of litter, which distracted from the natural beauty and historical value of the place.\n\nStill, this was a special and memorable part of our journey. The fishermen were hardworking and welcoming, and Peter made the whole experience feel personal and meaningful. I highly recommend this visit to anyone coming to Cochin—and if you can, ask for Peter. He made all the difference."

You can reach it easily by taking a Ro-Ro ferry from Fort Kochi. The lush greenery around the area makes the way to the beach even more stunning. There are a few food stalls nearby and a lighthouse that adds to the charm. It’s a quiet, refreshing spot—perfect for a peaceful getaway. A must-visit if you in Kochi."

The airport is so modern, clean, and well-maintained. There is a great variety of shops – from watch stores, glasses, jewelry, chocolates, chips, snacks, and books to a whole store dedicated to coconuts, plus Ripple Tea and Lots of options are open and available, which is amazing.\n\nThe staff is a mix – some are super sweet, while some are a bit rude.\n\nThe only disappointing part of our experience was with one of the porters. He helped us with the luggage (just from the car to the baggage drop area), and he charged us ₹750 for barely 6–7 minutes of work. This felt like a total scam, as the service would have been reasonable at around ₹300–350. This left a bitter impression despite the otherwise excellent facilities.\n\nOverall, Cochin Airport has definitely leveled up and impressed us with its cleanliness, modern facilities, and variety of shops. Highly commendable!"

The restrooms are spotless, a detail that often gets overlooked but makes a huge difference, especially on long journeys.\n\nThe terminal design is modern and airy, with expansive glass windows that allow natural light to flood the space, creating a calm and welcoming atmosphere. One of CIAL’s proudest distinctions is its status as the world’s first fully solar-powered airport, reflecting its strong commitment to eco-friendly practices.\n\nA notable convenience is the covered car parking, which adds a touch of comfort and protection from Kerala’s unpredictable weather. For those using the airport lounge, the food is surprisingly tasty — a great way to unwind before a flight.\n\nOverall, CIAL combines sustainability, cleanliness, and thoughtful design to provide a world-class travel experience."

Apart from the scenic views, you can also enjoy an ATV ride and walk on the floating bridge, both of which are paid but worth trying for the experience.\n\nThe drive to the beach itself is breathtaking, with water on both sides of the road, creating a serene and refreshing atmosphere. The beach is clean and not too crowded, allowing you to enjoy the sound of the waves in peace. There are also small food stalls nearby where you can grab some snacks. It’s a perfect spot for a quick getaway with friends or family."

The sea waves and its power is at its peak at this place and due to which it is known to have eaten up the homes of the people until the government had to intervene and build up a sea wall. The sea wall is amazing and there is a walkway to it where one can walk with their family at any point of time during the day or night. The place itself is very safe and there is ample amount of parking available if one is planning to visit this place with their vehicle. I would recommend this place to anyone who is tired of the nearby Fort Kochi beach and wants something secluded and private to walk with their families."

It offers a pleasant beach experience, ideal for beach activities like swimming.\n\nOn weekends, it tends to get crowded, which can affect the overall experience. Parking can be a bit tricky during peak times, so it's best to arrive early.\n\nThe beach is conveniently located near shops where you can find food, drinks, and beachwear, making it convenient for a day out by the sea. Overall, Cheari Beach is a great spot for beach lovers, despite the weekend crowds and parking challenges."

You have read about it, but you have to be there to believe it. Overall I think I found out where am going to be after I retire!!\n\nHarish was over eager in taking us around Kerala. He clearly loves the state and was extremely flexible and willing to stop along be route, taking pictures, suggesting alternatives, suggesting where we can find what we wanted, etc. The only improvement I can suggest is: Our guide can share some more stories about the places we went to, more historical info, you know like Guides usually do."

Just a 40 minutes drive from Kochi nestles this less crowded clean beach where you can spend your evenings cozily. I have never seen a beach where so different landforms coexist, you can experience the salty wind from the beach along with a visual treat of rows and rows of casuarina trees (kaattadi). Along side is a wetland area of a small lake with colourful boats and some frolicking cows. It also has mangroves, a must watch from the beautiful lighthouse nearby. The entry fees is just ₹10/- per person and ₹10/- for photography. It's in proximity to the beach. You will get a lot of refreshment snacks near the beach. If you wish to take photos or spend a quiet evening with privacy, opt this place. Weekends might be crowded."

Beach is somewhat clean but slowly getting dirty due to littering. One can take a long walk along the shores. I went on a Saturday and crowd was not extreme. We were able to manage social distancing. Snacks are available with a few street vendors. Sunset view is really nice and relaxing. Good to see some police men also available when it was getting dark. Overall a good beach to spend sunset view with family and hope people will not litter. Kite flying also is available"

Though the beach was quite crowded and parking was a bit tricky (we had to use paid parking), it didn't take away from the overall experience.\n\nWe reached around 6 PM, and the timing couldn’t have been better. The evening breeze, golden sunlight, and the sound of waves made for a really calming and scenic environment. The highlight of the visit was definitely the floating bridge. It costs around Rs. 120 per person, but it’s absolutely worth it. Walking over the waves on a gently swaying bridge while watching the sunset was a unique and memorable experience—it truly elevated our time at the beach.\n\nWhether you’re there just to relax, enjoy the breeze, or take in the view, Kuzhuppilly Beach is a great spot. Definitely recommend it for an evening visit!"

It costs Rs. 120 per person, and you get to spend about 10 minutes walking on the bridge, enjoying the views and the gentle sway over the water — a fun little addition to your beach visit.\n\nYou’re allowed to enter the water and enjoy a bath in the sea, making it a great place to unwind and cool off. The best time to visit is during the evenings when the light is perfect and the breeze is refreshing. However, weekends tend to be a bit crowded, so weekdays are definitely the better choice if you're looking for a calm and quiet outing.\n\nKuzhupilly Beach offers a clean, scenic escape that's perfect for a relaxing day, with a few simple activities to enjoy without the hustle of bigger tourist spots."

Some food items and icecream available. The sunset was absolutely mesmerizing. It will take maximum 45 mins from Fort Koch to reach this place and is the nearest open beach from Kochin. So if you are looking for a beach which is at a short distance from Kochi, this is the place."
