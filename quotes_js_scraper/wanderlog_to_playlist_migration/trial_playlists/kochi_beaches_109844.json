Though the beach was quite crowded and parking was a bit tricky (we had to use paid parking), it didn't take away from the overall experience.\n\nWe reached around 6 PM, and the timing couldn't have been better. The evening breeze, golden sunlight, and the sound of waves made for a really calming and scenic environment. The highlight of the visit was definitely the floating bridge. It costs around Rs. 120 per person, but it's absolutely worth it. Walking over the waves on a gently swaying bridge while watching the sunset was a unique and memorable experience-it truly elevated our time at the beach.\n\nWhether you're there just to relax, enjoy the breeze, or take in the view, Kuzhuppilly Beach is a great spot. Definitely recommend it for an evening visit!",

Though the beach was quite crowded and parking was a bit tricky (we had to use paid parking), it didn't take away from the overall experience.\n\nWe reached around 6 PM, and the timing couldn't have been better. The evening breeze, golden sunlight, and the sound of waves made for a really calming and scenic environment. The highlight of the visit was definitely the floating bridge. It costs around Rs. 120 per person, but it's absolutely worth it. Walking over the waves on a gently swaying bridge while watching the sunset was a unique and memorable experience-it truly elevated our time at the beach.\n\nWhether you're there just to relax, enjoy the breeze, or take in the view, Kuzhuppilly Beach is a great spot. Definitely recommend it for an evening visit!",

There is a Aqua tourism spot near this place operated by Matsya feds where boating activities are available.. No restaurants or eateries can be seen, it is better to carry some snacks but remember not to litter the place ;)",
