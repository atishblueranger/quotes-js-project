            "text": "Versova Beach is a hidden gem nestled in the bustling city of Mumbai. With its long stretch of golden sand, the beach is perfect for an early morning stroll or winding down after a hectic day. The rhythmic sound of the waves, the cool sea breeze, and the distant call of the fishermen setting out to sea create a serene atmosphere that's hard to find in a metro city.\n\nTop Highlights of this Beach –\n• Scenic views: Versova's coastline offers a beautiful sunrise view with the sea reflecting soft pastels. It's an ideal spot for photographers and nature lovers.\n• Cleanliness efforts: The beach has come a long way, thanks to regular clean-up drives organized by local volunteers. You'll often see community members picking up plastic and debris, making the shoreline more enjoyable.\n• Community vibe: There's a strong local presence here. Fishermen at work, kids flying kites, and families spending time together give the beach a warm, communal feel.\n\nThings to Know:\n• Crowd levels: Weekends and evenings can get busy, especially during festive seasons. If you prefer tranquility, visiting early in the morning is best.\n• Facilities: Basic amenities are available public toilets and a few food stalls serving chai, snacks, and seafood. However, don't expect luxury cafés or upscale eateries.\n• Safety: The sea can be rough at times. Swim only in designated zones and stay near lifeguard-patrolled areas. The beach is generally safe during daylight hours.\n\nMy Experience:\nI visited on a serene weekday morning. The cool breeze, soft sand underfoot, and the sight of fishermen mending nets made it a calming escape. I joined a local clean-up drive, which added meaning to my visit. Though facilities are simple, the real charm lies in the untouched, local ambience.\n\nOverall, Versova Beach is a must-visit for anyone looking for a quieter, more authentic Ayurvedic sea-breeze escape in Mumbai. I'd recommend adding your own touch by participating in volunteer activities or simply enjoying a peaceful walk.",

Versova beach is no exception. 10 mins walking distance from Versova Metro Station.\n\nIf walking, avoid going by the slums route (near thorats barbecue misal) because there's a lot of trash and snack stalls are far. Walk a little more and take Persian Darbar's route aka Main Entrance (extra 5-10 mins walking).\n\nSharing rickshaw from the metro station will cost 20rs per person, it will drop you near the main entrance.\n\nKalkhatta Gola is for 50rs, Mix Gola is for 60rs. You can tell the vendor to make a normal Gola to avoid fancy heart shape. You can rent a beach mat for 150rs or sit on the rocks. Don't throw litter, carry your trash out with you and dispose it in a dustbin. Be responsible and enjoy!",

Ladies side is totally useless.\n\nBeach itself is good enough. It's both Rocky and Sandy so nice to take pictures and all. Fairly clean.\n\nThe main attraction for me were the lots of tiny crabs. Children enjoyed running behind them.\n\nThey have few horse rides at the beach. You will find gola walas, but I did not find corns.\n\nVerdict: It's a good beach not much crowded. So you can definitely relax and enjoy your time here.\n\nNOTE: Please note that people drink and I found broken pieces of glass bottles at the beach. Please take care of yourself and your kids.",

Rated 4.5/5 stars.\n\nThe beach was clean, peaceful, and not crowded, which made it perfect for swimming and relaxing. We swam from 1 PM to 6 PM, and the changing tide levels throughout the day added to the experience. Around 1 PM, the water was shallow and far from the rocks, but by 5–6 PM, the waves had risen and started hitting the stones at the edge of the beach. Sitting on those rocks and feeling the waves crash against me was just an amazing feeling.\n\nJust a heads-up-the water is extremely salty. I had a bit of discomfort in my eyes, and even got a slight ear infection, but it's all fine now after a doctor visit.\n\nWe carried biryani, had a mini picnic in the evening, and responsibly cleaned the area before leaving. There were a few local food stalls nearby too.\n\nIt's a great spot for photography, family outings, or just peace of mind.\n\nTips for first-time visitors:\n\nAvoid going deep if you don't know how to swim.\n\nCarry your own food and water-but please clean up afterward.\n\nBest time to visit is early morning or late afternoon to avoid harsh heat.\n\nThe tide level rises in the evening, so plan your swim time accordingly.\n\nDon't forget sunscreen and sunglasses!",
