It's really a divine place and you get to see the lord Vishnu in a resting posture and the spirituality, architecture, cleanliness, security and the experience is top notch.\n\nI took the vip darshan with a ₹500 ticket and with this you can get the closest to the idol. I went at 8 am and you can enter through any of the four gates. Tickets are avilable inside the temple. After security check at the entrance head straight to the ticket counter and then joined the queue. Within 30 mins I was infront of lord Vishnu and asked for his blessings. No rush, no pushing and ample time in front of the idol was allowed. Post the darshana, I got prasadam which was included in the ticket price. Then visited lord Ganesha as well which is withing the temple complex. My heart and mind was at peace and I sat there admiring the temple architecture and beauty.\n\nTemple timing are displayed at the entrance and special puja ticket of around ₹3000 is also available. Best time for free darshana is to go early morning when the temple opens at 3am.\n\nAlso please note that dress code need to be strictly followed and no electronic item are allowed inside the temple. You get locker and  bathing facility at nominal rates.",

            "text": "I visited the temple during the weekend on a Saturday in July month. Instantly fell in love with the atmosphere and calmness inside and around the temple. It's really a divine place and you get to see the lord Vishnu in a resting posture and the spirituality, architecture, cleanliness, security and the experience is top notch.\n\nI took the vip darshan with a ₹500 ticket and with this you can get the closest to the idol. I went at 8 am and you can enter through any of the four gates. Tickets are avilable inside the temple. After security check at the entrance head straight to the ticket counter and then joined the queue. Within 30 mins I was infront of lord Vishnu and asked for his blessings. No rush, no pushing and ample time in front of the idol was allowed. Post the darshana, I got prasadam which was included in the ticket price. Then visited lord Ganesha as well which is withing the temple complex. My heart and mind was at peace and I sat there admiring the temple architecture and beauty.\n\nTemple timing are displayed at the entrance and special puja ticket of around ₹3000 is also available. Best time for free darshana is to go early morning when the temple opens at 3am.\n\nAlso please note that dress code need to be strictly followed and no electronic item are allowed inside the temple. You get locker and  bathing facility at nominal rates.",

Inside, the church is very spacious and peaceful. Even just sitting there in silence feels calming and meaningful. There's a divine atmosphere that surrounds you the moment you step in.\n\nOne of the hidden gems here is the underground museum. It's a fascinating space where you can explore many things from the robes and belongings of the priests to beautiful depictions of Jesus and elements of church history. It adds depth to the visit and gives a sense of spiritual and cultural richness.\n\nThe church is located near the sea, adding to its serene charm. A walk by the shore makes the experience even more special. The only downside is transportatio buses are often overcrowded and uncomfortable. But if you're coming by private vehicle, the trip is much easier and more enjoyable.\n\nTruly a place worth visiting!",

It's a great place to take a relaxed walk, unwind, and enjoy some peaceful moments amidst nature-even while being right in the middle of the city. The area is quite spacious, making it ideal for peaceful seating, thoughtful discussions, or simply soaking in the serene atmosphere.\n\nFrom big to small, famous to local, museums give us places to think, grow, learn, wonder, and feel. Few cultural institutions have remained as important as museums over the decades. They preserve and promote social interests as diverse and unique as the people who visit them-and Napier Museum is no exception.\n\nA night walk here is something truly special-the calm surroundings, the cool breeze, and the beautifully lit pathways create a soothing ambiance that's perfect for reflection or quiet conversations.\n\nWhether you're looking to reconnect with history, enjoy quiet time outdoors, or just take a refreshing stroll, Napier Museum offers something special for everyone. A must-visit for both locals and travelers alike.",

One needs to buy a ticket to enter the museum and there is a paid parking facility available nearby.\nThe architecture of the museum and the park around captivate anyone very easily to visit it from afar.

Spread across a huge, well maintained space, the place is spotlessly clean and beautifully organized, offering a calm escape right in the city.\n\nThe museum itself is free to enter, while the adjoining zoo entry costs just ₹50, which also includes a locker facility for bags and even plastic bottles a thoughtful touch for keeping the space clean. The zoo is expansive, and right outside, a small café serves as the perfect refresher after a walk.\n\nWhat makes this venue special is the balance it offers: while the exhibits and zoo engage your curiosity, the grounds themselves invite you to slow down. There are plenty of shaded spots and tree-side seating areas, making it easy to pause, rest, or just take in the serene atmosphere. Despite the outside heat, the entire space feels naturally cooler, adding to the comfort.\n\nWhether you're interested in history, looking to enjoy a day amidst nature, or simply searching for a peaceful retreat, Napier Museum is one of those rare places where you can do it all at once.",

Temple dharshan timings are quite different from other temples....plan accordingly\n3. Early morning Dharshan is less crowded, otherwise there is a waiting period of 1-2 hours as per crowd\n4. Special VIP dharshan tickets are available only in-person inside the temple\n5. Cloak rooms are available to keep valuable and cloth\n6. It is nice to visit the nearby Ganesha temple along with it\n7. There are four gates to enter, the east gate is more crowded.",

I felt a deep sense of peace and gratitude during my visit.

It's really a divine place and you get to see the lord Vishnu in a resting posture and the spirituality, architecture, cleanliness, security and the experience is top notch.\n\nI took the vip darshan with a ₹500 ticket and with this you can get the closest to the idol. I went at 8 am and you can enter through any of the four gates. Tickets are avilable inside the temple. After security check at the entrance head straight to the ticket counter and then joined the queue. Within 30 mins I was infront of lord Vishnu and asked for his blessings. No rush, no pushing and ample time in front of the idol was allowed. Post the darshana, I got prasadam which was included in the ticket price. Then visited lord Ganesha as well which is withing the temple complex. My heart and mind was at peace and I sat there admiring the temple architecture and beauty.\n\nTemple timing are displayed at the entrance and special puja ticket of around ₹3000 is also available. Best time for free darshana is to go early morning when the temple opens at 3am.\n\nAlso please note that dress code need to be strictly followed and no electronic item are allowed inside the temple. You get locker and  bathing facility at nominal rates.",

            "text": "A Hidden Gem with a Breathtaking View!\n\nVizhinjam Lighthouse is an absolute must-visit if you're near Kovalam or Thiruvananthapuram. It's not a very large lighthouse, but the view from the top is incredible. You get a 360-degree panoramic view of the Arabian Sea, nearby beaches, and the surrounding greenery.\n\nThe climb to the top is short but steep-around 140 steps and a narrow spiral staircase at the end. It's manageable for most people, and totally worth it for the scenery. The breeze up there is refreshing, especially around sunset.\n\nThe lighthouse is well-maintained and there's a small museum that gives you some interesting background on maritime history and navigation. Staff were polite and helpful.\n\nPro tip: Try to go during clear weather, preferably in the late afternoon, and bring your camera-the sunset view is unforgettable!\n\nEntry Fee: Very reasonable (₹20–₹30 when I visited).\nTiming: Check before going, as it sometimes closes around noon and reopens in the afternoon.\nParking: Available nearby.\n\nHighly recommended if you're in the area and want to enjoy a peaceful spot with a stunning view. 🌅",

They have a lift for people who fear climbing up :) The view from the top is breathtaking. See some of the snaps I got you will know. Since we visited during monsoons the wind was just pushing you all over and it was fun. A must visit spot to get a eagle view of Vizhinjam Harbour, beach and city and the wide expanse of sea. Just loved it. Keep some time at hand it's a great spot to spend an hour or more.",

Perfect for families, the park offers a serene floating bridge with stunning views and a unique lake-sea confluence. The solar-powered toy train is a delightful 2.5-km ride, winding through lush greenery, captivating both kids and adults. Boating-pedal boats (₹100 for 30 mins, 2-seater) and speed boats (₹700-1000 for 4-6 people)-is a highlight, though rides can feel short. The children's park, with swings, slides, and Kanayi Kunhiraman's sculptures, adds charm.\nFood options, like the KTDC floating restaurant, serve decent South Indian fare but are limited and pricey. Entry is affordable (₹5-30), with parking at ₹10-20. However, litter and broken equipment detract from the experience, and crowds swell in evenings. Adding water sports like kayaking could boost appeal. Overall, a relaxing half-day outing with great potential-better maintenance would help. I",

This is the temple known for performing the karkida vavu balitharpanam and remembarance day rites. Sayoojya pooja, brahmana bhojanam, annadhanam can also be done. The paternal rituals are conducted individually and in a group. Sub idols here are of lord brahma, lord mahavishnu, lord paramashiva, lord vinayagar, lord muruga, goddess bhadrakali and vedavyasa. Shrine of lord sastha is on a top rock structure not well maintained. Despite having high footfall devotees are not provided with good infrastructure facilities. The tiruvallam river before the temple in which devotees have to take a holy dip is contaminated and maligned as the temple management have no regard to faith. The road leading to the temple from the highway not yet developed and to reach the temple by car or by walk is congested. Car parking provided inside. Dress code apply in this temple, gents to wear dhotis without upper wears and womens traditional attires. Airport terminal 2 and north railway station nearby. By road reach near thiruvallam bridge on the kovalam highway and deviate to the service road, better to follow google maps.

            "text": "The concept of a 'Museum' gains significant value when the treasured heirloom artifacts of a Royal Family are exhibited within their original palace! The atmosphere is exceptional, amplifying the visual appeal of each display. Participating in a guided tour proves to be more fulfilling than exploring independently, as there is a wealth of history and interesting facts associated with each item. It typically requires over an hour and a half to thoroughly appreciate every artifact, but the experience is undoubtedly worthwhile. The visit was captivating. The palace, constructed by Maharaja Swathi Thirunal, provides an in-depth exploration of Kerala's historical and cultural landscape. The wooden architecture, elaborate carvings, and particularly the distinctive horse motifs (which lend the palace its name) are breathtaking. Strolling through the palace felt akin to traveling back in time, with exquisite artifacts, paintings, and royal memorabilia offering insights into the life of the Travancore royal family. The guides were well-informed and contributed essential context to the exhibits, rendering the tour both educational and engaging. Although photography is prohibited, which may disappoint some visitors, it serves to protect the artifacts. In summary, Kuthiramalika is an essential destination for those passionate about history and architecture. Puthen Malika Palace, also referred to as Puthen Malika Museum, is an essential site to visit in Thiruvananthapuram! This magnificent palace, erected in the 19th century, exemplifies the stunning architecture of Kerala and its rich royal heritage. The intricate wooden carvings and beautiful murals are visually captivating. Every corner narrates a story, and one can truly appreciate the craftsmanship that went into its creation.",

Perfect for families, the park offers a serene floating bridge with stunning views and a unique lake-sea confluence. The solar-powered toy train is a delightful 2.5-km ride, winding through lush greenery, captivating both kids and adults. Boating-pedal boats (₹100 for 30 mins, 2-seater) and speed boats (₹700-1000 for 4-6 people)-is a highlight, though rides can feel short. The children's park, with swings, slides, and Kanayi Kunhiraman's sculptures, adds charm.\nFood options, like the KTDC floating restaurant, serve decent South Indian fare but are limited and pricey. Entry is affordable (₹5-30), with parking at ₹10-20. However, litter and broken equipment detract from the experience, and crowds swell in evenings. Adding water sports like kayaking could boost appeal. Overall, a relaxing half-day outing with great potential-better maintenance would help. I",

There were also many shops selling vessels of aluminium, earthenware and ladles made of coconut shells.\n\nIt's a beautiful sight to see a lot of traditional shops still existing around.\n\nI would highly recommend you to visit this market to discover the history or just make a difference in the lives of these shops who have been around for many generations selling food and other quality household stuff items.",

Opposite the market, you'll find the beautifully renovated gopuram of the Sree Shaktivinayaka Temple, with the Juma Masjid conveniently located adjacent to it.\n\nEfforts have been made to maintain the market's historic charm. However, the presence of posters, banners, and party flags detracts from its aesthetic appeal.",
