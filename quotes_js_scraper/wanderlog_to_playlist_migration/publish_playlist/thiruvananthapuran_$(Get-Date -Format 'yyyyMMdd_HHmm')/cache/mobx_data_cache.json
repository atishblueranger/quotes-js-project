On one side rooms and restaurant is there and other side their is pool and ayurvedic spa centre.\nThe confluence of lake and arabian sea is amazing and can be seen while going every time for your parking.\nThe getting room on 1st floor as the view is much more good with balcony. The ground floor rooms are small. We did faced challenge as the last day we had our room booked for 1st floor but due to heavy rain the water seeps in the room. We again had to adjust to lower rooms in ground floor.\nIn terms of food it was tasty and good. Entire Staff is very helpful and they do ask about lunch and dinner by calling if you are out.\nAyurvedic massage is very good. I took full body massage and shirodhara treatment and the person who did it was an expert. I felt very calm after that.\nOverall i would recommend the property for it's unique location of private island, but if you have senior citizens or someone not comfortable going through boat then skip it."

The highlight is undoubtedly the stunning port view, which adds to the charm of this calm and serene location. The rooms are spacious and well-maintained.\n\nWe opted for a day outing and thoroughly enjoyed the infinity pool, which was a delightful experience. However, the food was average and could be improved. The biggest drawback is the lack of sufficient parking, which can be inconvenient. Additionally, the pricing is on the higher side.\n\nOverall, it's a great place for relaxation, especially if you're looking for a peaceful retreat with a breathtaking view and budget is not a concern."

              "reviewText": "Summary up front:\nWe stayed for a week, and leaving felt like saying goodbye to family. Front office staff, restaurant folks, Ayurvedic center team, gardeners, and the resort manager all came together to plant a tree with us (photo below) and then waved until our cab drove out of the gates. That moment sums up the heart of this place.\n\n1. The property (location, rooms, atmosphere)\nThis resort is something else. It sits on slightly elevated land right at the Arabian Sea, built in classical South Indian architecture but with all the modern comforts you’d want. We went in August during the monsoons—lush greenery everywhere, waves crashing just beyond the cottages. Within a day you forget time and place and just melt into nature’s calm. Pure bliss.\n\n2. Food and the team\nThe food is fantastic, but it’s the people who make it special. Everyone is so warm and polite, always going out of their way to make you comfortable. The chefs spoiled us—not just with what was on the menu (which was already excellent), but by cooking up little off-menu dishes for our girls. My wife fell in love with their filter coffee made with jaggery and coconut milk. When we tried and failed to find that jaggery in the local market, the chef actually arranged some and sent a kilo to our room the next day. That’s the level of care here.\n\nThe resort manager, Ameya, runs the place beautifully—like a homestay that’s cozy and personal, but with the professionalism of a top resort. He’s always around, talking to guests, giving advice, sharing stories. Meals here were a highlight: fresh, tasty, served with love, and often enjoyed with sea breeze (or rain) in the background. Easily some of our best memories.\n\n3. Ayurvedic center & yoga\nWe both did consultations and massages, and the doctors really took their time—listening, explaining, suggesting long-term lifestyle tips. The therapists were excellent too. Honestly, if you’re coming for Ayurveda, stay at least a week (two if you can).\n\nYoga was another gem. Classes moved indoors when it rained, but otherwise they were held by the sea each morning. I skipped (and regret it), but my wife went daily. The instructor, Mr. Unni, is such a gentle, wise soul. He didn’t just teach yoga but shared life stories, tailored advice, and treated each guest like a friend.\n\nFinal thoughts\nThis isn’t just a place to stay—it’s a place to reconnect with yourself and with nature. If you want to slow down, heal, and recharge, I can’t recommend it enough."

Located on a stunning hill, it offers direct up close and personal views of the Arabian Sea in all its glory. The benches placed at strategic locations all across the property are a definite win-win and offer perfect photo-ops!\n\nOther than unforgettable views and a premium feel, the hotel offers an extremely memorable stay with warm interiors and cosy comfort.\n\nAt the time of checkin we were upgraded to a premium sea view room which was a huge plus and much appreciated. Their breakfast buffet had a good selection of items. We tried their chicken biryani for dinner and it was a winner too!!\n\nA special mention goes out to ms. Hema and Akansha at the reception for their personalised attention."

Premium Seaview Rooms or the Club Rooms have the best views.\n\nThe property is well maintained with lots of places to take a walk. There are places to sit & enjoy the waves crashing into the beach.\n\nA visit to the Tides beach side restaurant is a must.\n\nThe service is exceptional with staff always smiling & helpful."

Not sure if different chefs handle the different times.\n\nRooms can definitely improve. Quite cramped for the price paid, though the view was to die for. Definitely not toddler friendly. The rooms have a couple of stairs that cannot be blocked plus the bathroom door does not lock from the outside which is a nightmare with a toddler. The bathroom floors are extremely slippery and my baby did have a bad fall too. Luckily nothing grave happened. All the complimentary toiletries and tea spread are literally hidden away in the never ending drawers and it is quite a treasure hunt. Even the refrigerator is locked and opened only on request.\n\nAll the staff were exceptional and went out of their way to make us feel welcome. They were especially sweet to our baby and even sent us home with soft toys for the kiddo. Special mention to “Mitali” who helped us with a last minute birthday surprise and made the stay all the more special."

Got upgraded to Club Room with an uninterrupted sea view and with waves lashing on to rocks at the base of the Club room.\nWhat sets this resort apart is the ambience and the excellent customer service from every staff in the hotel. Butler was very very helpful and made sure that elderly parents who needed wheelchair support are well taken care of and mobility does not impact them. Housekeeping staff always took care of anything needed super promptly and so did the front desk. Hats off to the managers and the. entire staff for creating such a welcoming atmosphere and for going out of their way to make it comfortable for their guests. Truly appreciate the staff.\nFood was awesome and so were the entire staff in the restaurant. The Chef checked with us what we would like to have for breakfast the previous evening and made Mutton stew for us despite that not being on the breakfast menu and included couple of other items in the breakfast buffet menu based on our request. Don't miss the filter coffee, Kerala tea, dosas, uzhunnu vada and puris for breakfast. Lovely ambience, lovely resort, lovely food and lovely staff!! We will be back for sure 😊"

The design of the hotel is a perfect mix of tradition and modern style. Nature and technology come together in a very peaceful and beautiful way.\n\nThe Leela Kovalam is in the best location near the beach. The sea, the trees, and the wind create a calm and relaxing feeling. I especially want to recommend the sunset swimming experience. I don’t know who designed it, but the height of the pool and the sea level match so well. You can enjoy the most amazing sunset while swimming. It was the best moment of my whole trip in India.\n\nAll the staff were very kind and helpful. They treated us with great care and respect. The food was excellent. The bed, pillows, and mattress were so soft and comfortable.  I felt like I was sleeping on a cloud! There was also a special smell in the room that made it feel even more relaxing. I already miss it so much.\n\nOne more thing! I left something very important in the room by mistake. The hotel manager and staff helped me a lot. I want to thank Shahna Ma’am especially. She helped me find my lost item, and I am really grateful for her help.\n\nIf you visit Kerala, I strongly recommend staying at The Leela Hotel. You will have one of the best experiences of your life."

Food at dinner time was delicious, and breakfast had plenty of vegetarian options and was adequate. Beach access is not direct, it requires a bit of a walk outside the property through public roads although at the beach there are sun beds and towels provided, and the beach itself is very beautiful and clean (swimming not advisable). Plenty of area to walk around, lots of hammocks etc and activities such as pottery are available. Staff were all very friendly and accommodating."

The rooms had a charming traditional feel and were comfortably laid out to accommodate our family's needs. One of the highlights was the private swing just outside the room, overlooking a beautifully maintained garden with a hammock that added to the relaxing atmosphere.\n\nA short walk from our rooms led us to a quaint tea stall with views of the beach. While it was a bit of a trek to reach the beach, the setting made it worthwhile. The food at the resort was quite good, offering a decent variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. However, we felt it would have been even better with more authentic local Kerala cuisine options to truly elevate the dining experience.\n\nThat said, there are a few areas where the resort could improve. The bathrooms were not soundproof, and we could clearly hear our neighbors’ conversations, which took away from the tranquility during moments like a relaxing shower. Also, the walk to the rooms was quite long and dark and we often had to wait a considerable time for the buggy service. Transportation is a challenge here—there are no nearby transport options, and external car services appear to be monopolised, making them quite pricey.\n\nDespite these points, the ambiance, hospitality and overall feel of the resort make it a place we’d definitely consider returning to—especially for special occasions or a quiet, relaxing escape. We do hope for improvements in transport convenience and more competitive pricing, but with a good deal or discount, it’s certainly worth another stay."

Our pool-facing room was spacious, and the extra bed arranged for our son was surprisingly comfortable. The hotel boasts three pools, which made up for the fact that the private beach was a letdown — quite rocky and closed due to high tide. If you're visiting in June, July, or August, be prepared for limited beach access.\n\nThe kitchen shuts at 3 PM, which caught us off guard, leaving us to settle for snacks instead of a proper lunch. While tasty, the portion sizes could be more generous. On the plus side, the bar has a happy hour starting at 7 PM, and the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful throughout our stay.\n\nIdeal for a relaxing poolside break, but check beach conditions if that’s a priority."

The sea frontage and lush greenery made the whole atmosphere peaceful and refreshing. The ambience is lovely, and the resort is very well maintained.\n\nUsually, I take a full room and property tour, but this time was all about slowing down, mindfulness, and simply enjoying the moment — and UDS was the perfect place for that.\n\nThe food was delicious, with plenty of variety, and the staff were polite, helpful, and made us feel truly welcome. Our kids especially enjoyed the swimming pool — a perfect place for a family break.\n\nHighly recommended for any\none looking to relax by the beach with good food, great service, and a calm, scenic vibe."

There was a private party near the swimming pool, loud music was played from 7 pm, decibels crossed the danger level, windows vibrated,our peaceful holiday shattered with every beat played by the DJ.

I had to stay because my trip planner booked it, and it was just for two night. It didn't feel like a 3-star hotel; it was worse than an average hotel.

Still I am unable to get a GST bill. So any one planning to visit on an official visit stay away from this resort.\nApart from that had got rashes after staying there. Wasn't clean as we would expect.\nNo food available! Morning breakfast everywhere is served around 7 to 8. They'll tell complimentary breakfast but they'll give after 9! Who would stay till 9 for a breakfast! That too when we are in an official visit. And that too even requesting that we would be leaving early so had asked them to prepare accordingly!\nIt's unfortunate that I'm unable to get a reimbursement from my company as they scamed me from getting a GST Bill.\nSo I highly *won't* recommend this hotel!"

The rooms were clean with all amenities, a balcony that opens to the sea. Great location, well maintained pool and restaurant and decent breakfast spread. But the service takes the cake. Everyone from reception to pool boy was excellent. The watchman gave us restaurant recommendations. The pool boy got us some neat shots. The restaurant staff gave us very helpful tips for sight seeing. Loved every minute of the stay! Will come back definitely. 10/10 would recommend."

I couldn’t have been more pleased. The rooms were spacious, well-furnished, and really very comfortable and clean. Balconies overlooking the beach, perfect temperature control, space to unpack everything we brought, and more… the rooms we were given provided everything we could have hoped for and more. Most exceptional of all, however, was the staff. Every staff member - from reception, to waiters, to parking lot attendants, to the lifeguard were kind, warm, professional, and always eager to help with every little thing. Each staff member always had a welcoming smile on their face. The location couldn’t have been better, as we could walk to Lighthouse Beach easily. I will now be looking for reasons to return to Kovalam for the purpose of staying at Soma Palmshore Resort. Oh, and I should probably mention, the food is great, too! 👍"

Both the atmosphere, furniture and menu all seemed to be a bit tired. The food was not good, nor was it fresh as was advertised and promised. Head down the hill to a wide array of restaurants, that's my tip.   Oh and and theres no wifi in the rooms, this could be a deal breaker for some.

While the room itself and the view are impressive, we encountered significant hygiene concerns. The hotel might not be ideal for elderly guests due to the lack of a lift and its location, which requires a 6-7 minute walk from the nearest accessible point. Additionally, the hotel doesn't have any on-site parking, so guests will need to park some distance away. I am giving 3 stars because of the politeness of the owner. He is trying his best but needs lot of improvement. The ground floor has no AC and this information is not available on the booking site as well."

Very rude owner. All the towels were yellow stained. Dust on objects. Only the location is good. Rest everything is messed up. Reception was unmanned for most of the time and we also had to ask for bottled water. The response from the hotel staff was very crude and uncouth. The hotel is simply charging too much money and not worth the stay. THEY ARE MANIPULATING THE TRAVELERS ONLY ON THE BASIS OF LOCATION.  Stay at your own risk!"

You’ll find fishermen at work and a few local shops nearby. The beach is clean, but swimming might be restricted due to strong waves. A nice place to relax and enjoy the sea breeze.\n\nLet me know if you'd like this in Malayalam or want to mention any specific experiences!"

No toiletries provided the towel was also smelling bad. Before booking we asked the host about barbeque facility he said u can do it after booking done we asked the caretaker about that he said it is not possible as some problem is there and locals issue. Host should be knowing all these things. And the TV which is there is older than my grandfather. Overall bad management that's all."

First of all, I must say that Renjith is an excellent host who always checked in to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. He truly went above and beyond to make our stay enjoyable.\n\nThe house itself is quite old, but Renjith has done a fantastic job of maintaining it and providing all the necessary facilities. The bedrooms are on the small side, but they are comfortable and functional. The location of the house is also great, as it is accessible to all the major attractions and not too far from the city center. The road leading to the property is big enough and not congested, making it easy to get in and out.\n\nAll the amenities in the house were in good working order and served our purpose well. The only issue we had was with the air conditioning, which was of poor quality and didn't cool the room as well as we would have liked.\n\nDespite this minor inconvenience, I would highly recommend this property to anyone looking for a comfortable and convenient place to stay. Renjith is truly a superhost and deserves all the kudos he can get. Thank you for a wonderful stay!"

There's also a helicopter installation placed nearby, which adds to the attraction and catches the attention of tourists.\n\nI visited the beach at the end of May, during the onset of the monsoon season.

It’s especially crowded on Sundays—but much of the original beach, along with pathways and benches, has been swallowed by relentless sea erosion in recent years. With new coastal projects like Adani’s underway, the landscape here is set to transform even more dramatically in the next decade, making today’s sunsets at the shore unique and precious moments. So, visit soon: soak in the vibrant sunset, tread carefully around the water, and make the most of what’s left of this Thiruvananthapuram icon before it changes forever.

The beach has a calm, relaxed vibe that instantly makes you feel at ease. It's perfect for a quiet walk, watching the waves, or just sitting and enjoying the sea breeze.\n\nThe beach is wide and open, giving you plenty of space to sit or walk without feeling crowded. I went in the evening, and the sunset view was absolutely stunning – the sky turned a beautiful mix of orange and pink as the sun dipped below the horizon. It’s a perfect spot for photography lovers and anyone who enjoys nature at its best.\n\nOne of the highlights of this beach is the huge mermaid sculpture (Sagarakanyaka), which is not only impressive but also adds an artistic and cultural charm to the place. It’s a unique landmark that you won’t find at other beaches.\n\nEven though it's close to the city, it doesn’t feel chaotic. There were families, couples, and tourists – but the atmosphere was still peaceful. It’s also a place of spiritual and cultural importance, especially during certain Hindu festivals when rituals are performed here.\n\nThere are a few snack stalls and tea vendors nearby, so you can enjoy a cup of tea or a local bite while watching the waves. The breeze, the sound of the sea, and the open sky make it a great place to unwind.\n\nIf you're in Trivandrum and want to experience a blend of natural beauty, culture, and calmness, Shanghumukham Beach is a must-visit. I’d definitely love to go back again."

Nestled atop a cliff overlooking the Arabian Sea, the temple offers a mesmerizing view, especially during sunrise and sunset. The towering 58-ft Shiva statue, intricately carved and exuding divine energy, is the main highlight. The craftsmanship and detailing in the statue make it a marvel to behold.\n\nThe serene ambiance, coupled with the soothing sea breeze, creates a perfect setting for meditation and reflection. The temple premises are well-maintained, and the surrounding greenery adds to its charm. Visitors can also enjoy the nearby Azhimala Beach, known for its rugged coastline and stunning waves. Whether you seek spiritual solace or simply want to admire the architectural wonder, Azhimala Temple is a must-visit. My experience here in December 2024 was truly unforgettable, leaving me with a deep sense of peace and reverence."

Perched on a rocky cliff overlooking the Arabian Sea, the temple is famous for its breathtaking ocean views and serene ambiance. The highlight of the temple is the massive 58-foot-tall statue of Lord Shiva, one of the tallest in South India. This intricately sculpted statue, depicting Shiva in a meditative yet fierce posture with flowing hair, has become a major attraction for devotees and tourists alike.\n\nThe temple's name, \"Azhimala,\" means \"mountain by the sea,\" aptly describing its stunning location. Devotees flock to the temple, especially on Mondays and during Maha Shivaratri, to seek blessings and witness the spiritual grandeur of the place.\n\nJust below the temple lies Azhimala Beach, a pristine and lesser-known coastal paradise. The beach is famous for its golden sands, rocky outcrops, and mesmerizing sunsets. Unlike the more commercialized beaches in Kerala, Azhimala Beach retains a peaceful and untouched charm, making it perfect for relaxation and photography.\n\nTogether, Azhimala Shiva Temple and Beach offer a unique blend of spirituality and natural beauty, making it a must-visit destination in Kerala."

The moment I stepped near the edge, I felt a rush of adrenaline and a sense of wonder. The vast expanse of the landscape unfolded before me, with the wind whipping my hair and the sun casting a golden glow over the scenery.\n\nThe cliff's rugged texture and dramatic drop-off made for a thrilling experience, and I found myself feeling both terrified and exhilarated at the same time. The views were simply stunning, with the distant horizon stretching out as far as the eye could see.\n\nIf you're looking for a unique and unforgettable experience, I highly recommend visiting this cliff. Just be sure to exercise caution and respect the natural environment.\n\n*Pros:*\n\n- Breathtaking views\n- Thrilling experience\n- Unique natural wonder\n\n*Cons:*\n\n- Can be dangerous if not approached with caution\n- Weather conditions can affect visibility and safety\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this cliff to anyone seeking an adventure or a chance to connect with nature's raw power."

The architecture, divine energy and rich Kerala tradition well witnessed in this sacred place.\n\nTips for a pleasant visit:\n1. Strict dress code to be followed by devotees ( traditional dress for women and only dhoti with towel for men) Shirt and T-shirts are not allowed\n2. Temple dharshan timings are quite different from other temples....plan accordingly\n3. Early morning Dharshan is less crowded, otherwise there is a waiting period of 1-2 hours as per crowd\n4. Special VIP dharshan tickets are available only in-person inside the temple\n5. Cloak rooms are available to keep valuable and cloth\n6. It is nice to visit the nearby Ganesha temple along with it\n7. There are four gates to enter, the east gate is more crowded."

              "reviewText": "I visited the temple during the weekend on a Saturday in July month. Instantly fell in love with the atmosphere and calmness inside and around the temple. It's really a divine place and you get to see the lord Vishnu in a resting posture and the spirituality, architecture, cleanliness, security and the experience is top notch.\n\nI took the vip darshan with a ₹500 ticket and with this you can get the closest to the idol. I went at 8 am and you can enter through any of the four gates. Tickets are avilable inside the temple. After security check at the entrance head straight to the ticket counter and then joined the queue. Within 30 mins I was infront of lord Vishnu and asked for his blessings. No rush, no pushing and ample time in front of the idol was allowed. Post the darshana, I got prasadam which was included in the ticket price. Then visited lord Ganesha as well which is withing the temple complex. My heart and mind was at peace and I sat there admiring the temple architecture and beauty.\n\nTemple timing are displayed at the entrance and special puja ticket of around ₹3000 is also available. Best time for free darshana is to go early morning when the temple opens at 3am.\n\nAlso please note that dress code need to be strictly followed and no electronic item are allowed inside the temple. You get locker and  bathing facility at nominal rates."

              "reviewText": "Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, is a revered Hindu shrine dedicated to Lord Vishnu, depicted in a reclining posture on the serpent Anantha. Renowned for its Dravidian architecture and spiritual significance, the temple is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu. The temple's main deity is composed of 12,008 saligrams, fossilized shells from the Gandaki River in Nepal, and is preserved using a unique Ayurvedic mixture called \"Katusarkara yogam\" .\n\nThe temple is also famous for its treasure vaults, which were discovered to contain immense wealth, including gold, jewels, and artifacts, making it one of the richest temples in the world . In June 2025, the temple hosted a rare Maha Kumbhabhishekam, a consecration ritual conducted after nearly 270 years, marking a significant event in its history .\n\nVisitors are required to adhere to a strict dress code: men must wear a white dhoti with an angavastram, and women should wear a sari. Entry is permitted only to Hindus, as per the Temple Entry Proclamation . The temple opens for darshan at 3:15 am and closes at 7:20 pm, with various slots for prayers and rituals throughout the day .\n\nWhile the temple offers a profound spiritual experience, some visitors have reported issues such as overcrowding and lack of proper guidance for tourists . Additionally, the temple's treasure vaults have been a subject of legal and spiritual debates, adding to its mystique and intrigue .\n\nOverall, Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple stands as a testament to Kerala's rich cultural and spiritual heritage, offering visitors a glimpse into the region's deep-rooted traditions and beliefs."

Spread across a huge, well maintained space, the place is spotlessly clean and beautifully organized, offering a calm escape right in the city.\n\nThe museum itself is free to enter, while the adjoining zoo entry costs just ₹50, which also includes a locker facility for bags and even plastic bottles a thoughtful touch for keeping the space clean. The zoo is expansive, and right outside, a small café serves as the perfect refresher after a walk.\n\nWhat makes this venue special is the balance it offers: while the exhibits and zoo engage your curiosity, the grounds themselves invite you to slow down. There are plenty of shaded spots and tree-side seating areas, making it easy to pause, rest, or just take in the serene atmosphere. Despite the outside heat, the entire space feels naturally cooler, adding to the comfort.\n\nWhether you’re interested in history, looking to enjoy a day amidst nature, or simply searching for a peaceful retreat, Napier Museum is one of those rare places where you can do it all at once."

Nestled among greenery and built with stunning architecture, this historic palace is more than just a monument – it's an experience. I’ve visited this place many times, and every visit feels refreshing and unique.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you is the serene and natural surroundings. The palace is surrounded by sprawling lawns, tall trees, and beautifully landscaped gardens. It’s a perfect spot to unwind and disconnect from the daily hustle of city life. Whether you're coming here with family, friends, or even alone, there’s always a peaceful vibe that makes you feel calm and recharged.\n\nOne of the biggest highlights of Kanakakkunnu is the ambiance during the evenings and night. As the sun sets, the palace and the entire grounds are lit up beautifully, giving it a royal and almost magical charm. The soft lighting, the quiet surroundings, and the cool breeze create a soothing atmosphere that's ideal for night walks, casual conversations, or simply enjoying the beauty around you. The night vibe here is highly recommended, especially if you enjoy peaceful, scenic places with character.\n\nApart from just relaxing, Kanakakkunnu also serves as a cultural hub. Many art exhibitions, cultural events, and traditional programs are held here throughout the year. During festivals or special occasions, the palace comes alive with music, lights, and activities – it’s a great way to experience Kerala's rich culture and traditions.\n\nThere are plenty of open areas where you can sit and enjoy the view, read a book, or even have a casual picnic. The whole campus is clean and well-maintained, which shows the effort taken by the authorities to preserve its beauty. It’s also a popular spot for photography lovers – the combination of old architecture and natural scenery offers the perfect backdrop.\n\nAnother thing I really appreciate is how accessible and welcoming the place is. There is good parking space nearby, and small stalls outside sell tea, coffee, and snacks, making it convenient for visitors. Entry is usually free or minimal, and it's safe even during the night, which is a big plus.\n\nOverall, I would say Kanakakkunnu Palace is not just a tourist attraction – it’s a peaceful retreat, a cultural hotspot, and a heritage landmark all in one. It’s a must-visit place for anyone in or around Thiruvananthapuram, whether you are a local resident or a tourist. If you have a few free hours in the evening or want to explore something beautiful and relaxing, this is the place to go."

There are benches to rest and shaded areas if you want to sit for a while and relax.\n\nOne of the best places in Trivandrum city to connect with nature, refresh your mind, and begin your day positively. Highly recommended for morning walkers, yoga practitioners, or anyone who loves a calm outdoor space within the city."

It’s not one of those massive royal palaces, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in charm and history.\n\nThe building itself is this beautiful old Kerala-style structure with sloping tiled roofs and wooden beams—super traditional and photogenic. You can literally feel the history in the air. It was built way back in the 1600s.\n\nInside, there are museums. The Folklore Museum has some really cool stuff like old musical instruments, traditional lamps, costumes, and even tools people used ages ago. On the ground floor is the coin museum, Ancient coins collections are there. The place isn’t crowded at all—perfect if you want a quiet, thoughtful afternoon. The gardens around the palace are also nice, and it’s a great spot if you’re into photography, culture, or just want a chill outing away from the usual city spots."

It mostly feels like a regular exhibition. If you’ve been to the Keralam History and Heritage Museum, the vibe is pretty similar — except the Keralam Museum has more stunning sculptures, cave paintings, and artistic displays. That said, Koyikkal Palace does have a few things that make it unique. I won’t spoil anything, but there are some interesting elements that are worth checking out. I still encourage everyone to visit it at least once. I went today, and I was the only visitor there 😅 — which actually made the experience even better.You can ask the staff more about the palace’s history or even the rumored stories connected to it — they’re usually happy to share. Entry is super affordable: just ₹30 for adults, ₹10 if you want to use your phone camera, and ₹150 extra if you’re planning to take videos or reels.\n\nSo yeah, not mind-blowing, but peaceful, low-key interesting, and worth a visit if you're into heritage spots."

Credits goes to Mr. Manoj for showcasing high level of professionalism , work ethics and his value to client satisfaction .I appreciate that the installment  was requested only after completion of that portion of work.\nMy day to day interaction with Armson was through Sreelekshmi who coordinated the things very well and was quick to respond to any query.\nComing to Quality of work , One section of work which I felt exceptional are the structural part ie the work of footing , plinth beams and brick work etc. Furthermore post the work they would neatly clean the site which is rare . The delivery of modular kitchen cabinets under workmanship of Shiju , work of Aluminum crockery , the electrical dept. , tilework were also too good.\nThe sections which I felt could be made better would be the painting and plumbing works.\nOverall Quite satisfied with the deliverable . All the best team Armson Homes. Going for 4 star due to overshoot of the scheduled work which had caused little inconvenience as it was a live house."

After meeting a few architects, we chose S Squared architects and it was one of the best decisions we made. The combination of professionalism, their skills not only in the domain of architecture but also in the interactions and understanding our needs is commendable.\nThe design of the patio, the connectivity among some of the rooms in the ground floor, cross ventilation, bringing natural light as an element in the design, unique blend of architecture and comfort for living- these were the highlights.\nThe end result did exceed our expectations and I would highly recommend S Squared architecture to build your dream home."

              "reviewText": "Recently got to know that one of the lavish home in Kerala is designed by S Square Architects Pvt Ltd.\n\nEvery corner of this palatial villa designed by S Squared Architects sparkles with natural elements—from flora and fauna to stonework and water features— making it an instantly inviting and breathtaking home.\n\nThe bungalow built on a six acre property in Trivandrum consists of a semi basement, three floors and a high roof attic. The semi basement houses all the service needs of the house including the electrical rooms, parking spaces, pool tank etc. The bedrooms, living spaces and den are housed on the first and second floor. The most vibrant space of the house is the attic converted into a recreational area dotted with chess and cards table, gaming stations and billiards board. There is also a small pantry for game nights. The piece de resistance is the ceiling which is hand-painted to resemble a vintage map. The flooring makes use of the leftover wood from the construction. A look out balcony on this floor comes with awe-inspiring views of the Indian ocean.\n\nA central courtyard separates the more private spaces from the formal drawing room meant for guests. The five en-suite bedrooms are accessible through foyers from the central courtyard. There is a grand library on the second floor with a home office placed within.\n\nThe crowning glory of the house is the indoor swimming pool. “This is the activity hub of the house with framed views from the dining room, living room, kitchen and the master bedroom. The gym also opens out into this space. There is an interesting bar at the corner. The pool is naturally lit with a skylight that allows the morning light to filter in bestowing upon it a magical sun kissed aura that defines the start of the day. It is an oasis of peace and relaxation for the inhabitants and creates a dramatic escape from the busy life.\n\nPrioritising high-quality materials over ornamentation, the designers wove a sense of bespoke craftsmanship into each room. “We had to acclimatise the design to respond to challenges of the local climate and locally available materials and construction techniques. A skin wall was added to the exterior walls to protect it from the harsh Kerala sun and rain.\n\nA heavy cornice work at the edge of the sloping roof not just conceals the rainwater gutter but also minimises impact of rainwater on the walls. The sandstone slabs left over from the indoor swimming pool flooring was used for the cracked effect flooring of the gazebo reducing wastage of material. The semi basement of the house has been camouflaged using a gently sloping mound of lush green lawn and graceful curved masses of mixed planting which creates a stunning contrast to the honey coloured walls. It’s a quirky house: asymmetrical and interesting, with surprises around every corner."

Another thing about him that impressed us was that he had a clear idea about the minute details in his plan and the plan covered all the facilities we needed. He vowed with his futuristic ideas which we were sure would become trendsetters. Our expectations were not wrong as visitors compliment the classy designs even today.\nI would like to thank Srijit Srinivas Architects for building our dream home."

His works are of such a specialized nature..\n\nMy 4 bedroom house is an example of how perfect architectural planning by Srijit has brought so much comfort and value to my house. The openness inside the house is amazing, the courtyard brings in that freshness and is lively.  The house is minimalist,  there is every protection from heavy rains, sun etc ( all subtly designed) and we are so happy to experience the wonderful spaces with no troubles at all.\nSrijit Srinivas Architects are thorough professionals- they will charge you a reasonable fee, but take my word, you will get all your money's worth, once u see the output.\nThanking you once again for the lovely design” 👍🏾"

The first and only design proposed by Srijit Srinivas met our expectations and reflected the details of our detailed discussions. His commitment and passion for his own designs and towards our Project was palpable in the detailing on safety, simplicity and aesthetics that he gave to our house. We are profoundly delighted by the final work product and the serene and calm environment he created for his architectural baby, which we now call our home. While his rationale for retaining a professional identity as an Architect for his firm is well justified and therefore, dependence on and choice of external civil construction agencies, Srijit might wish to consider a growing expectation from his prospective clients to identify a committed self sustaining civil engineering team as part and parcel of his own firm - who will have the ability to read his marvellous designs and convert them into elegant rational forms.\n\nVery happy to have been associated with Srijit for our own Project. It is a relationship that we as a family have built beyond Srijit's professional prowess. I would thoroughly recommend Srijit Srinivas as a thinking professional architect, if you are ever in search of one."

After an elaborate search on the net, i came across Srijit sirs work and i had this instant gut feeling to go for him.\nOnce we had an official discussion where we sat down for describing our needs and purposes, which he wholeheartedly accepted , we were all immensely happy.\nAll he said was “Now leave everything to me” and from there on he took the full responsibility of getting our dream house completed on time even when the Covid situation was prevailing.\nI would say i have rarely come across a person with such clarity of thoughts and extra ordinary visualisation! Both of these virtues makes an architect  stand out from the rest.\nthough its been 2 years since we moved to our new home , its still as special as it was on day one. All credits go to the Architect himself. 🙌🏻"

It's not often that we see an architect who keeps the barrier so high for himself in everything he does in the project.  Srijit always comes out with minimal and neat, yet in-vogue /head-turning designs. Aesthetics is his forte and he does micro detailing  to levels which baffles one.\n\nOn hindsight, one of the best things I have ever done is to have resisted the urge to  provide \"client's gyaan\" to Srijit on his design choices!  Each time we (my wife and myself) felt the urge to 'improvise' on Srijit's design/aesthetics related related choices - we did not press for it.\n\"Let us leave it to Srijit, he should be right\" - was our refrain.  Once the house was completed, we realised how right and wise - we were!\n\nIn short - Leave it to Srijit. He will help you build a beautiful home :)"

I would not recommend this builder to anyone and would advise others to look for a more qualified and reliable contractor.\n\n1. They won't respond once the payment is done. Delayed my home construction for 3 months.\n2. Wooden works are not yet finished. Always ask for extra money and even dare to ask permission for doing additional work, just give you a bill/amount to pay for.\n3. They said they will do all the paper works for get the home construction permit and house number, but they didn't do anything.\n4. The simple elevation we had selected was not met and the builder did not live up to their promise of delivering a quality construction.\n5. It has been over a year since the completion of the construction project and the builder has failed to address and rectify the numerous issues that were present.

At this time local Protestants in Trivandrum worshipped in a church constructed by the Protestant Evangelical Trust in the 1830s. After Rev Cox resigned in 1861, he was succeeded by Rev Samuel Mateer, who led the church for 30 years and died in 1893. By this time the congregation had grown and needed larger premises and it planned to build a new church building in memory of Rev Mateer. The architectural style used in constructing the church was Hallenkirche (hall church) style. The church building was made in granite, with a square bell tower with a vestibule beneath and a roof supported by gothic arches. The Celtic cross on the bell tower is made of cut stone and commemorates Mateer's Irish background."

I was very skeptical about the construction in my plot due to its irregular orientation. After meeting and discussing with Mr.Christin I was given multiple options of design which helped  see the bigger picture. I really appreciate the design team for bringing forth multiple design options within a short span of time, considering all my requirements and always being available for discussions  and changes. The friendly approach of the entire team definitely helped me in being more comfortable in sharing the ideas I personally have about my house. Coming to the execution part the same friendly and approachable attitude is maintained throughout the process. The only drawback I was even though it was resolved later on was the communication and misinterpretations  during the final stage of the construction. Apart from that I really enjoyed the association  and living in\nthe  house since 2015 . Thank you for your sincere efforts and contributions. Wishing you for your future endeavors."

Sorry for the long message.\n\nIt was during 2022, when I actively started searching for a good interior firm who could do the interior work for my apartment in Trivandrum.\nI came across iNova infra from one of the YouTube videos that they published on their account. The Google reviews also suggested more than a 4.75 rating for them at that time!\nI went to their office near Infosys (Trivandrum), had multiple discussions, a site visit, and finally handed over the work to them officially during the first week of August 2022.\nAlso paid the token advance during the second week of August. Till then, everything was going really well.\nI was satisfied with the discussions we had, the quick responses to my messages/calls, the site visit they arranged - even though it was an ongoing work.\n\nBut things were different from the moment I paid the advance money (or when they got a hint that I was going to be with them for sure).\nThey started responding really late to my calls/messages (sometimes no response at all), and I was forced to visit their office a number of times to get some updates on the work status.\nI was informed that the next steps would be to sign an agreement and also start the design work.\nIt took almost 3 weeks for them to prepare a draft agreement and also come up with a 'TV UNIT DESIGN' - after a number of follow-up calls/messages, visits, etc!!!\nUpon suggesting one correction, it took them another 5 weeks to come back with the corrected TV unit design and a new KITCHEN UNIT design!!!\nAgain, after a number of calls/messages and 'visits' to their office!!!\nThen it again took 3 more weeks for them to come up with a draft pooja unit and a wash unit design—after a number of follow-up calls/messages/visits, etc!!!\n\nIN SHORT : the work that they initially assured to complete within 45–50 days of time period was not even initiated even after 3 months!\nThe progress they made was that they got the advance money from me and a few draft designs on which multiple corrections were suggested.\n\nFinally, I lost all hope and called it off—by the end of Nov-2023.\n\nI do have all the proofs (call logs, whatsapp messages, payment receipt, etc) to justify what I have written above.\nI was thinking of filing a case against them legally, but I got busy with my apartment work.\nLater, decided not to move in that direction and spend more of my time, energy, and more money.. Peace !!!! :)\n\nI hope this review will be helpful for those who try to consider iNova Infra as an option.\nFrom my experience, if you have a lot of time to do the work, then iNova Infra is definitely a good choice. But if you are trying to complete the work quickly, better search for other alternatives."

Once I met Christin, I really got confident about going  ahead with the project in full fledge. He certainly explained to me the life cycle of the whole project  with respect to it's cost and designs. I talked about my choice regarding the selection of materials for the works.\nHis team Abhiraj and others had developed a wonderful design in our uneven looking plot to make it perfectly cozy.They used cent percent prime quality materials throughout the project according to their specifications. Some additional amount had to be laid down as we selected products of  higher cost other than their spec.\nThe only hitch I found was that they got one month delayed for completing  my 3100sq ft dream home.\nI recommend this design consultancy I nova infra to all as I left  them totally happy and satisfied. And I am living in my 🏡 home with fullfillment, every day since 2017. Best Wishes ."

From what I have heard and seen it takes forever for them to start the operations of accident morning my friends have to wait nearly 12 hours and I have hot of a lot more cases like that. But if you have a major accident of any thoughts and you go to the general hospital or any smaller government hospitals they are going to send you here. But I would highly recommend you to go to a private hospital if you have the finances or a health insurance that can cover. I am not saying it's a bad hospital or anything but there are quite a bit of things  they can work on."

Highly process oriented discourses which are deep-rooted in personal narra­tives blent with the stories of people and place enable the student to perceive the perceptional, behavioural and psychological dimensions of space and to translate the thoughts into built forms.",

You need to call and book your visit and the park will be open exclusively for you.  As of now they welcome only one group per day.     You are required to report in the morning 09.30am and stay back till evening 4:30pm\n\nThe visit involves a lecture-cum-interaction section with Suresh Sir, followed by multiple lab visits.   Each lab the volunteers walk you through a series of experiments, and then lets the kids to do experiments themselves.   There is a lot of enthusiasm from the organizers' side.    One must carry a pen and notebook so that they can note down observations and potential questions.  Finally there is a closing lecture-cum-interaction.\n\nThe visit is long. But it is really worth it.    You can take a break in between from experiments and play some small games like darts etc that is set up.\n\nFood is not available in the location.   Either you could carry food or ask Suresh Sir to give some caterer's contact who will serve it."

Even for a small enquiry you have to wait for hrs and they will say the part or service is not available.\nI gave my Nothing phone 1 for service, the phone is 2 yrs old and stopped working.\nThey said it needs a motherboard replacement which would cost 22k. That seemed illogical to me so I didn't do it.\nI handed the phone to a local repair shop and they said it was a short on the motherboard and they fixed it for ₹500. It amazed me how the local shop has more knowledge and understanding than experts who work in centres like this."

Spread across a huge, well maintained space, the place is spotlessly clean and beautifully organized, offering a calm escape right in the city.\n\nThe museum itself is free to enter, while the adjoining zoo entry costs just ₹50, which also includes a locker facility for bags and even plastic bottles a thoughtful touch for keeping the space clean. The zoo is expansive, and right outside, a small café serves as the perfect refresher after a walk.\n\nWhat makes this venue special is the balance it offers: while the exhibits and zoo engage your curiosity, the grounds themselves invite you to slow down. There are plenty of shaded spots and tree-side seating areas, making it easy to pause, rest, or just take in the serene atmosphere. Despite the outside heat, the entire space feels naturally cooler, adding to the comfort.\n\nWhether you’re interested in history, looking to enjoy a day amidst nature, or simply searching for a peaceful retreat, Napier Museum is one of those rare places where you can do it all at once."

There is no dedicated parking space but you can park your vehicles near to this site. Safe swimming spaces are there in the lake.

Plastic bottles and food items are not allowed inside, For plastic bottles, a refundable deposit of 20 rupees is collected, which you can claim upon return. Drinking water refill points are available inside, and there’s a small shop for tea and snacks. Also a cloakroom is available at the entrance. A great place for families and kids. Worth the visit."

The zoo is beautifully maintained with a wide variety of animals, from majestic tigers to exotic birds, all kept in spacious and natural enclosures. The lush greenery and clean surroundings made the walk even more enjoyable. The museum was equally fascinating, offering a rich glimpse into Kerala’s cultural and historical heritage through its detailed exhibits and artifacts. The aquarium, though smaller, was well-organized and showcased a lovely collection of marine life. I was especially impressed by how educational yet entertaining the whole visit was. The place is perfect for families, students, and anyone who appreciates nature and history. I absolutely loved my time there and would highly recommend it to others visiting Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nThe ticket for the zoo and swara art gallery was 30-40 something .... and zoo and aquarium ticket was also separate....in total you will need to buy 3 tickets"

The moment I walked in, I was impressed by how green, peaceful, and clean the entire zoo is. The big trees gave plenty of shade, and the pathways were wide and well maintained, which made walking around very pleasant. It felt like stepping into a calm natural space right in the middle of the city.\n\nThe animals were the real highlight of today’s visit. I spent a lot of time watching the Royal Bengal Tigers and Asiatic Lions—both looked majestic and powerful, and it was amazing to see them so close. The giraffes were another star attraction, tall and graceful, and they caught everyone’s attention. I also enjoyed seeing the Indian One-Horned Rhinoceros, which is rare and exciting to witness in person. The zebras, with their unique stripes, were fascinating, and of course, the elephants were a joy to watch as always. The hippos relaxing in water and the graceful herds of deer added even more charm to the visit.\n\nThe bird section was full of life and color. Today I was especially amazed by the macaws, parrots, and hornbills—they were so vibrant and active. The peacocks were beautiful too, adding a touch of elegance to the aviary. I also walked through the reptile house, where I saw crocodiles, snakes, and other reptiles. It was both exciting and educational. Every enclosure felt thoughtfully designed, and I appreciated how natural the surroundings looked.\n\nAnother thing I noticed during today’s visit was how well the place is maintained. The enclosures were clean, the animals looked healthy, and the zoo staff clearly put effort into keeping the environment neat. There were enough resting spots and drinking water points, which made the visit comfortable even though I spent a good amount of time exploring. The ticket price was very affordable for the quality of the experience.\n\nAfter the zoo, I also took a quick look at the Natural History Museum and Sree Chitra Art Gallery nearby, which made the trip even more meaningful. Both are located right next to the zoo and add great value if you want to make it a complete day outing.\n\nOverall, today’s visit to Thiruvananthapuram Zoo was fantastic. It’s a place where you can relax, learn, and enjoy the beauty of nature and wildlife all at once. I left with great memories, and I would definitely recommend this zoo to anyone visiting Thiruvananthapuram. 🌿🦒🐅🦓🦜🐘"

In 1729, Marthanda Varma founded the princely state of Thiruvithamkoor and Thiruvananthapuram was made the capital in 1745 after shifting the capital from Padmanabhapuram in Tamil Nadu.[15] In the mid-19th century, the city was under the reign of Swathi Thirunal and Ayilyam Thirunal.

Also it is inside a building so he will be able to walk a lot without much crowd. We went on a Saturday and rainy day. There was very little crowd almost 20 people or so. He loved the exhibits especially the wild animals but was afraid of the skeletons. He ran a lot from one exhibit to another and would address most birds as crow. He knew lion tiger and giraffe from his soft toys. Everything except snake and giraffe are stuffed live animals. They have maintained it well. Really good and would suggest others to see it"

Located near the zoo and Napier Museum, it’s surrounded by trees and gardens that give a calm feeling even before you enter.\n\nInside, the museum is well-organised with separate sections for birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, fossils, and tribal life. You’ll see lifelike models of animals, skeletons, and preserved specimens displayed with proper descriptions. One of the most interesting parts is the fossil gallery, which includes ancient tree trunks and other rare finds.\n\nThe building itself has an old charm, and the exhibits are arranged in a way that makes it easy to walk through and learn. It’s a good place for kids and students, but adults who enjoy learning will also find it engaging. It usually takes around one to two hours to see everything.\n\nPhotography is not allowed inside, and there is no cafeteria, but the museum is clean and the staff are helpful. There’s also a small garden with dinosaur statues that adds a playful touch, especially for children.\n\nIf you enjoy learning about nature or want to spend a quiet and meaningful afternoon in the city, this is definitely a good place to visit."

As a history enthusiast, I was blown away by the vast collection of artifacts and exhibits that showcase the rich cultural and natural heritage of Kerala.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped inside, I was struck by the stunning architecture of the building itself, which is a beautiful blend of traditional and modern styles. The museum's layout is thoughtfully designed, making it easy to navigate and explore the various galleries.\n\nThe exhibits are incredibly well-curated, with detailed labels and descriptions that provide a wealth of information about each artifact. I was particularly fascinated by the ancient stone sculptures, bronze idols, and traditional Kerala murals on display. The museum's collection of tribal artifacts and traditional crafts was also impressive, offering a glimpse into the lives of Kerala's indigenous communities.\n\nWhat I appreciated most about this museum was the way it weaves together the natural and cultural history of the region. The exhibits on Kerala's flora and fauna, including the stunning taxidermy displays, were just as engaging as the historical and anthropological exhibits. It was amazing to see how the museum highlights the interconnectedness of human and natural history.\n\nThe staff were friendly and knowledgeable, and the museum's facilities were clean and well-maintained. Overall, I would highly recommend the Natural History Museum in Trivandrum to anyone interested in history, culture, or the natural world."

With over 150 rooms, it blends the simple elegance of Kerala architecture with hints of Dravidian influence and even touches of European design like tall steeples and a wooden lift  .\n\nSet on a small hillock and surrounded by lush greenery, the building stands out in the city, its six towers visible from afar  . It was built with respect to Vastu Shastra and oriented to welcome monsoon breezes, showing how practical design and beauty were both important  . Inside, long corridors and high ceilings, carved wooden beams, and large halls hint at the royal gatherings and cultural events that took place here  .\n\nThough visitors can’t enter, it still feels like walking through history. You can admire the elegant façade, spot the wood‑lift shaft, and imagine the palace in its heyday. Nearby gardens hold the king’s burial site, which adds quiet meaning to the place  .\n\nThe palace remains the private home of the Travancore royal family, especially the descendants of the Maharajah’s sister  . Seeing it from the outside gives a sense of Kerala’s royal heritage, smart design, and how tradition and daily life once united here.\n\nIf you drive or walk past, take time to slow down and notice the architecture, the breeze‑friendly layout, the historical importance, and the idea of home it conveys—even without entry, it leaves a memorable impression."

              "reviewText": "The concept of a 'Museum' gains significant value when the treasured heirloom artifacts of a Royal Family are exhibited within their original palace! The atmosphere is exceptional, amplifying the visual appeal of each display. Participating in a guided tour proves to be more fulfilling than exploring independently, as there is a wealth of history and interesting facts associated with each item. It typically requires over an hour and a half to thoroughly appreciate every artifact, but the experience is undoubtedly worthwhile. The visit was captivating. The palace, constructed by Maharaja Swathi Thirunal, provides an in-depth exploration of Kerala’s historical and cultural landscape. The wooden architecture, elaborate carvings, and particularly the distinctive horse motifs (which lend the palace its name) are breathtaking. Strolling through the palace felt akin to traveling back in time, with exquisite artifacts, paintings, and royal memorabilia offering insights into the life of the Travancore royal family. The guides were well-informed and contributed essential context to the exhibits, rendering the tour both educational and engaging. Although photography is prohibited, which may disappoint some visitors, it serves to protect the artifacts. In summary, Kuthiramalika is an essential destination for those passionate about history and architecture. Puthen Malika Palace, also referred to as Puthen Malika Museum, is an essential site to visit in Thiruvananthapuram! This magnificent palace, erected in the 19th century, exemplifies the stunning architecture of Kerala and its rich royal heritage. The intricate wooden carvings and beautiful murals are visually captivating. Every corner narrates a story, and one can truly appreciate the craftsmanship that went into its creation."

It’s not as though the items are one-of-a-kind treasures; they are simply a collection of things. The explanation given for such high charges was quite skillful, but honestly, it turned out to be very disappointing after going inside. Hearing claims like *“the valuables cost crores”* doesn’t justify the price of admission."

Guide available and they'll tell you about everything. The ticket cost 70/- and with chithralayam ticket it's 100. Old sculptures, guns, decorative items and things used in the palace iss kept here. Some of them is over 1000 years old and it's really exciting to visit to such a place. Overall enjoyed a lot. The inside photography cost 500 and I think that's reasonable, if all the items is real!! And I don't understand why 50 rupees for outside photography. Because you can click photos without a ticket, there's no one there to question it or asking ticket for photography outside. So I think that's not necessary at all. Overall a good experience. You can visit there sometime while visiting sreepadmanabha swmy temple, it situated nearly, especially if you're an history buff."

Located right at the heart of Thampanoor, the station is well connected to Chalai Bazaar, bus stands, and other prime areas of the city, making it very convenient for travelers.\n\nThe station building is historic yet modern in its facilities. The platforms are spacious, well-maintained, and equipped with digital display boards that provide clear information about arrivals and departures. Waiting areas are clean, with comfortable seating, and there are plenty of food stalls, tea shops, and small restaurants nearby for refreshments. The ticket counters and online booking kiosks are organized, and staff are generally helpful in guiding passengers.\n\nAnother big advantage is its connectivity – trains from here cover almost all major destinations across India, from Chennai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad to long-distance trains to Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata. For tourists, it is also the gateway to exploring the charm of Trivandrum, including Kovalam Beach, Padmanabhaswamy Temple, and nearby attractions.\n\nSecurity is good with CCTV surveillance, and announcements are regular and clear. Parking space is available, though during peak hours it can get crowded. Overall, Trivandrum Central is a clean, well-managed, and traveler-friendly railway station that offers a smooth experience whether you are arriving, departing, or just passing through."

It’s not one of those massive royal palaces, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in charm and history.\n\nThe building itself is this beautiful old Kerala-style structure with sloping tiled roofs and wooden beams—super traditional and photogenic. You can literally feel the history in the air. It was built way back in the 1600s.\n\nInside, there are museums. The Folklore Museum has some really cool stuff like old musical instruments, traditional lamps, costumes, and even tools people used ages ago. On the ground floor is the coin museum, Ancient coins collections are there. The place isn’t crowded at all—perfect if you want a quiet, thoughtful afternoon. The gardens around the palace are also nice, and it’s a great spot if you’re into photography, culture, or just want a chill outing away from the usual city spots."

It mostly feels like a regular exhibition. If you’ve been to the Keralam History and Heritage Museum, the vibe is pretty similar — except the Keralam Museum has more stunning sculptures, cave paintings, and artistic displays. That said, Koyikkal Palace does have a few things that make it unique. I won’t spoil anything, but there are some interesting elements that are worth checking out. I still encourage everyone to visit it at least once. I went today, and I was the only visitor there 😅 — which actually made the experience even better.You can ask the staff more about the palace’s history or even the rumored stories connected to it — they’re usually happy to share. Entry is super affordable: just ₹30 for adults, ₹10 if you want to use your phone camera, and ₹150 extra if you’re planning to take videos or reels.\n\nSo yeah, not mind-blowing, but peaceful, low-key interesting, and worth a visit if you're into heritage spots."

It was built in the 1840s by Maharaja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma, a king known not just for his rule but also for his deep love of music and the arts.\n\nThe name Kuthiramalika means Palace of Horses, and when you look up at the roof you’ll see 122 wooden horses carved into the structure. That detail alone makes the building special, but there is a lot more inside. The palace is a perfect example of traditional Kerala style, with sloping tiled roofs, wooden carvings, and cool stone floors made from a special mix that includes egg white and charcoal.\n\nInside the museum, each room tells its own story. You’ll see royal thrones, one made of ivory and another of crystal. There are old musical instruments, paintings, chandeliers, mirrors from Europe, and even a wooden tree that makes different musical notes when tapped. A painting by Raja Ravi Varma and life-size Kathakali models are also part of the collection.\n\nThe visit is peaceful. A guide walks you through the rooms and explains the history, helping you imagine how the royal family once lived here. The museum doesn’t feel crowded, and the calm atmosphere makes it easy to enjoy. The tour takes about one to two hours.\n\nPhotography is not allowed inside, but you can take pictures outside if you pay a small fee. The museum is usually closed on Mondays and opens in the afternoon.\n\nIf you are interested in Kerala’s royal history, traditional architecture, or just want to see something different and beautifully preserved, this palace is definitely worth visiting."

The food served here is, without exaggeration, some of the worst I've ever had in Trivandrum. It's disappointing to see such poor standards maintained in a place that sees so many visitors.\n\nIf you're planning to visit, I strongly recommend eating outside the premises if possible. And to those in charge: please consider reevaluating the current food vendor. Bringing in a better contractor could dramatically improve the experience for everyone."

Do not expect too much variety foods from here - you can have noodles, fried rice, sandwiches, cutlet,  french fries, tea, coffee, ice creams, fresh juices etc. The counter is self service so we need to pay money in cash counter and bring in the receipt here for ordering the food. if its crowded we have to wait  for sometime but they will serve as soon as they can. So times we may feel like unattended, that is because of the heavy rush.  There is no roof for the seating and so will be bit difficult during rainy season. Anyway this restaurant will be highly helpful for refresh ourselves after the long walk inside the zoo."

It was a perfect blend of tradition and wellness, with the scenic backdrop of the lush golf course adding a serene touch to the festivities.\n\nThe highlight of the event was undoubtedly the Sadya catered by White Damor. It was a grand feast that perfectly captured the essence of Onam. Every dish was authentic, flavorful, and prepared with fresh ingredients. The variety on the banana leaf—from the delicious sambar, rasam, and avial to the sweet ending with payasam—was a true treat for the senses. What stood out was the balance of traditional flavors with a healthy twist, which resonated with the Brio League’s ethos of holistic nutrition.\n\nThe attention to detail by White Damor was impeccable. Not only did they ensure the Sadya followed traditional customs, but the portion sizes and the quality of the food also reflected a focus on health and wellness. It was comforting to know that one could indulge in a festive meal without compromising on nutrition.\n\nSai Trivandrum Golf Club offered the perfect venue for the celebration. Its sprawling greens, peaceful ambiance, and well-maintained facilities made the event even more enjoyable. The team at Brio League did an excellent job in organizing the event, seamlessly blending cultural celebration with their mission of promoting holistic health.\n\nOverall, the event was a wonderful experience, and the Sadya by White Damor was an unforgettable highlight. I look forward to more such celebrations where tradition meets wellness in a beautiful setting like Sai Trivandrum Golf Club."

A variety of birds, from vibrant songbirds to majestic eagles, add life to the tranquil setting, their melodies weaving into the silence of the rolling greens. The exclusivity of the club enhances its allure, with restricted entry ensuring an atmosphere of peace and privacy. Here, amidst nature’s embrace, every swing feels like a moment of pure escape, a retreat into a world where elegance meets the untouched beauty of the wild."

Trees abound and there are nooks and crannies where you can sit and watch people take up their golf clubs for the first time and practice driving into the nets.\n\nThe atmosphere is tranquil and the greens stretch far into the distance. We're here on a weekend and the number of cars probably exceeds the number of players\n\nThe rooms are big with high ceilings laid out with wooden planks. The balconies are a good place to take in the view.\n\nNot much choice in terms of food but a hot cuppa tea in the morning makes more sense than most other things in life.\n\nWe wandered around the environs and came across a swing with a thin log, not a plank. In most places, when an adult takes to the swing, it looks incongruous. But we were saved by the lack of an audience, even though I took a tumble by trying to step off too soon!"

You can see shades of chinese architecture in the buildings and arena in the club too. However, they are poorly maintained. It isn't open for public but one can book it for function/parties and so on.  The atmosphere is calm and pleasant. There is a cafe, and there are also suit rooms available.. Pet's are not allowed and ironically, one can spot stray dogs here and there."

Professional and well organized.\n\nThe tour was well organized, from the time that we landed at Kochi airport, to the time that we were dropped off on our last day.\n\nAs per the schedule, all items in our itinerary were covered, all accomodations were of acceptable, if not superior standards and the locations covered were exceptional.  The houseboat ride was probably the highlight of the tour.\n\nA very special thanks go to our driver and friend, Mr. Unni, who was a very patient and friendly individual.  He took every precuation possible to ensure that our journey was safe, and made an extra effort each time to drive carefully in order to ensure the safety of the passengers.\n\nAs for suggestions, our only request is that we be prepared with the details of each activity in advance.  As an example, it would have helped us if we were informed beforehand that the boat ride on the Thekkady wildlife sanctuary would involve wearing life-jackets and that the seats would be pre-allocated at the time of purchasing the tickets.  Our expectations of the boat ride was also very high, and were disappointed that we were unable to see the kind of wildlife that we were expecting.  This caused a minor inconvenience during our trip, and could have been avoided if we were informed beforehand.\n\nOverall though, it was a very memorable trip that we will cherish for a very long time."

I went to the opticals in front to buy a contact lens which I have been using but they said they can't give me until I pay and consult the doctor.\nI think then instead of opening the opticals , you shud keep everything inside so that after the doctor's consultation, you can give specs or contacts if u don't provide anything with ppl having prescriptions ."

Spread across a huge, well maintained space, the place is spotlessly clean and beautifully organized, offering a calm escape right in the city.\n\nThe museum itself is free to enter, while the adjoining zoo entry costs just ₹50, which also includes a locker facility for bags and even plastic bottles a thoughtful touch for keeping the space clean. The zoo is expansive, and right outside, a small café serves as the perfect refresher after a walk.\n\nWhat makes this venue special is the balance it offers: while the exhibits and zoo engage your curiosity, the grounds themselves invite you to slow down. There are plenty of shaded spots and tree-side seating areas, making it easy to pause, rest, or just take in the serene atmosphere. Despite the outside heat, the entire space feels naturally cooler, adding to the comfort.\n\nWhether you’re interested in history, looking to enjoy a day amidst nature, or simply searching for a peaceful retreat, Napier Museum is one of those rare places where you can do it all at once."

              "reviewText": "\"I recently had the pleasure of visiting the Napier Museum in Trivandrum and was thoroughly impressed. The museum is a beautiful example of Indo-Saracenic architecture, and its stunning red and white exterior is a sight to behold.\n\nInside, the collection is a fascinating journey through Kerala's rich history and culture. The bronze sculptures, ancient musical instruments, and intricate ivory carvings are all beautifully preserved and displayed. I particularly enjoyed the section on traditional Kathakali costumes and the impressive collection of temple chariots.\n\nThe grounds surrounding the museum are equally lovely, providing a peaceful escape from the city's hustle and bustle. The lush green lawns, blooming flowers, and the nearby Trivandrum Zoo make for a perfect day out.\n\nThe staff were friendly and helpful, and the museum was clean and well-maintained. The Napier Museum is a true gem in Trivandrum, offering a wonderful blend of history, art, and nature. It's a must-visit for anyone interested in the cultural heritage of Kerala."

The architecture, divine energy and rich Kerala tradition well witnessed in this sacred place.\n\nTips for a pleasant visit:\n1. Strict dress code to be followed by devotees ( traditional dress for women and only dhoti with towel for men) Shirt and T-shirts are not allowed\n2. Temple dharshan timings are quite different from other temples....plan accordingly\n3. Early morning Dharshan is less crowded, otherwise there is a waiting period of 1-2 hours as per crowd\n4.

It's really a divine place and you get to see the lord Vishnu in a resting posture and the spirituality, architecture, cleanliness, security and the experience is top notch.\n\nI took the vip darshan with a ₹500 ticket and with this you can get the closest to the idol. I went at 8 am and you can enter through any of the four gates. Tickets are avilable inside the temple. After security check at the entrance head straight to the ticket counter and then joined the queue. Within 30 mins I was infront of lord Vishnu and asked for his blessings. No rush, no pushing and ample time in front of the idol was allowed. Post the darshana, I got prasadam which was included in the ticket price. Then visited lord Ganesha as well which is withing the temple complex. My heart and mind was at peace and I sat there admiring the temple architecture and beauty.\n\nTemple timing are displayed at the entrance and special puja ticket of around ₹3000 is also available. Best time for free darshana is to go early morning when the temple opens at 3am.\n\nAlso please note that dress code need to be strictly followed and no electronic item are allowed inside the temple. You get locker and  bathing facility at nominal rates."

              "reviewText": "Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, is a revered Hindu shrine dedicated to Lord Vishnu, depicted in a reclining posture on the serpent Anantha. Renowned for its Dravidian architecture and spiritual significance, the temple is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu. The temple's main deity is composed of 12,008 saligrams, fossilized shells from the Gandaki River in Nepal, and is preserved using a unique Ayurvedic mixture called \"Katusarkara yogam\" .\n\nThe temple is also famous for its treasure vaults, which were discovered to contain immense wealth, including gold, jewels, and artifacts, making it one of the richest temples in the world . In June 2025, the temple hosted a rare Maha Kumbhabhishekam, a consecration ritual conducted after nearly 270 years, marking a significant event in its history .\n\nVisitors are required to adhere to a strict dress code: men must wear a white dhoti with an angavastram, and women should wear a sari. Entry is permitted only to Hindus, as per the Temple Entry Proclamation . The temple opens for darshan at 3:15 am and closes at 7:20 pm, with various slots for prayers and rituals throughout the day .\n\nWhile the temple offers a profound spiritual experience, some visitors have reported issues such as overcrowding and lack of proper guidance for tourists . Additionally, the temple's treasure vaults have been a subject of legal and spiritual debates, adding to its mystique and intrigue .\n\nOverall, Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple stands as a testament to Kerala's rich cultural and spiritual heritage, offering visitors a glimpse into the region's deep-rooted traditions and beliefs."

Perfect for families, the park offers a serene floating bridge with stunning views and a unique lake-sea confluence. The solar-powered toy train is a delightful 2.5-km ride, winding through lush greenery, captivating both kids and adults. Boating—pedal boats (₹100 for 30 mins, 2-seater) and speed boats (₹700-1000 for 4-6 people)—is a highlight, though rides can feel short. The children’s park, with swings, slides, and Kanayi Kunhiraman’s sculptures, adds charm.\nFood options, like the KTDC floating restaurant, serve decent South Indian fare but are limited and pricey. Entry is affordable (₹5-30), with parking at ₹10-20. However, litter and broken equipment detract from the experience, and crowds swell in evenings. Adding water sports like kayaking could boost appeal. Overall, a relaxing half-day outing with great potential—better maintenance would help. I"

It's offers various activities including a kid's playground, landscaped garden, sculpture, horse riding, boating, toy train ride etc. The train ride was amazing. It goes around the park including bridge and pond. A nice walkway bridge over the water and a beautiful garden, there are some seats to rest and enjoy the lush greenery. Also the lakeside path you can see the panoramic views of the surroundings and enjoy the cool breeze of the backwater.\nWell organized facilities, beautiful scenery and fun activities make you a perfect spot to spend time with family and friends, especially children. Also the shoreline of Arabian sea feel the warm embrace of the sun in your skin and soft brown sands between the toes. There is a floating cafeteria and KTDC run restaurant. Spacious parking areas and paid washroom facilities available, good and hygienic."

It looks like a lot changed.\n\nVeli tourist village is mainly for kids with couple of parks, miniature train ride, hourse ride, etc..\n\nIt's a good place for a walk with scenic beauty. The pathways and grass are well maintained.\n\nFloating restaurant was closed by mentioning renovation but cant see any renovation work going on. I saw a bio toilet but doesn't seems to be working. floating bridge also require some maintenance. In kids park also some equipments are damaged but not yet repaired. So there are some areas were no maintenance are being done."

A massive mermaid sculpture, an iconic piece of art, welcomes you at the entrance, making it a popular photo spot. There's also a helicopter installation placed nearby, which adds to the attraction and catches the attention of tourists.\n\nI visited the beach at the end of May, during the onset of the monsoon season. Due to heavy rainfall, it wasn’t an ideal time to explore or enjoy the beach fully. I recommend planning your visit during the dry season for the best experience."

It’s especially crowded on Sundays—but much of the original beach, along with pathways and benches, has been swallowed by relentless sea erosion in recent years. With new coastal projects like Adani’s underway, the landscape here is set to transform even more dramatically in the next decade, making today’s sunsets at the shore unique and precious moments. So, visit soon: soak in the vibrant sunset, tread carefully around the water, and make the most of what’s left of this Thiruvananthapuram icon before it changes forever. PRO tip—skip the pista flavor at the Amul shop on the premises!\n\nA piece of advice for fellow travelers: cherish this living memory while you can, as Shangumugham Beach is on the brink of becoming part of Kerala’s coastal history."

The beach has a calm, relaxed vibe that instantly makes you feel at ease. It's perfect for a quiet walk, watching the waves, or just sitting and enjoying the sea breeze.\n\nThe beach is wide and open, giving you plenty of space to sit or walk without feeling crowded. I went in the evening, and the sunset view was absolutely stunning – the sky turned a beautiful mix of orange and pink as the sun dipped below the horizon. It’s a perfect spot for photography lovers and anyone who enjoys nature at its best.\n\nOne of the highlights of this beach is the huge mermaid sculpture (Sagarakanyaka), which is not only impressive but also adds an artistic and cultural charm to the place. It’s a unique landmark that you won’t find at other beaches.\n\nEven though it's close to the city, it doesn’t feel chaotic. There were families, couples, and tourists – but the atmosphere was still peaceful. It’s also a place of spiritual and cultural importance, especially during certain Hindu festivals when rituals are performed here.\n\nThere are a few snack stalls and tea vendors nearby, so you can enjoy a cup of tea or a local bite while watching the waves. The breeze, the sound of the sea, and the open sky make it a great place to unwind.\n\nIf you're in Trivandrum and want to experience a blend of natural beauty, culture, and calmness, Shanghumukham Beach is a must-visit. I’d definitely love to go back again."

It was a quiet place and there were only a few people there. When I went there, it was between 3-4 pm so I'm not sure how it is during the late hours.\n\nIt's also a beautiful place for photoshoots and all cause there are beautiful things to capture. There are also some stalls to eat and have fun playing some games.\n\nBut there was one thing that I didn't like. Many of the adventure rides weren't open when I went there, and that's not the right thing considering I paid the ticket price as well."

The project was launched only a few years ago, yet it's not being properly maintained. The water fountain isn't functioning, which is disappointing. Entry to glass bridge is restricted. While launching such projects is a great initiative, maintaining them is equally crucial. Unfortunately, many parks in the city are in similar conditions."

The staff was super friendly, especially toward our baby girl. They even arranged a baby chair and served the food just right for her.\n\nThe dishes were flavourful and fresh—especially the [mention a dish, like \"paneer tikka\" or \"chicken fried rice\"]. Kalluz enjoyed the soft naan and mildly spiced dal.

The moment I stepped inside, I was greeted by the warm, smiling faces of the staff who truly made me feel welcome (special mention to Miss Shamna)\n\nThe cleanliness of the facility was impressive. It’s clear that they prioritize not just the fun experiences, but also the safety and comfort of their guests.\nThe variety of shows offered is fantastic, catering to all age groups and interests. Whether you're a fan of magic, acrobatics, or theatrical performances, there's something for everyone. I particularly enjoyed the interactive elements of the show, which made it feel personal and engaging.\n\nWhat really stood out to me was Magic Planet's commitment to giving back to the community. I learned about their various charity initiatives, and it warmed my heart to see a business that not only focuses on entertainment but also on making a positive impact in the lives of others. Their efforts to support local charities and engage with the community truly set them apart.\n\nOverall, my experience at Magic Planet was magical in every sense of the word. From the friendly staff to the immaculate surroundings and their charitable endeavors, I left feeling uplifted and inspired. I highly recommend visiting Magic Planet for a day of fun and joy—it's a place where smiles are contagious, and the magic is real!"

Children can learn a lot of things about another side of childhood where our differently abled children their entire childhood in colours instead of chaos. They grow, live, learn and earn with Magic Planet. I would recommend this place as a must visit place for everyone. Also keep in mind the shows are understandable for kids above 5 years only.  The full day program includes a food and snack facility on the campus itself. Ample parking is available."

The forenoon session mostly focuses on the performance of differently abled children.\n\nStepping into Magic Planet was an experience that transcended mere entertainment. This is not just a theme park; it's a unique social experiment that is succeeding with grace and excellence. The park is a platform to empower and rehabilitate an often overlooked community—differently-abled children and street magicians. Seeing these incredible artists perform with such skill, confidence, and sheer joy is breathtaking. The work done here, training and providing a livelihood for these talented individuals, is a rare and beautiful initiative that sets Magic Planet apart from any other attraction.\n\nThe park’s architecture and design are stunning, creating a truly enchanting atmosphere. Every corner of the park is thoughtfully crafted to ignite the imagination. The magic and circus sessions are, without a doubt, scintillating. The illusions are world-class, the acrobatics are gravity-defying, and the performances are delivered with professionalism and passion, keeping you on the edge of your seat. The variety of shows, from close-up magic to grand illusions, ensures that there is something to captivate every family member.\n\nEvery staff member we interacted with was incredibly polite, sensible, and genuinely helpful. Their care and attention to detail, especially in managing a crowd with diverse needs, speak volumes about the place's ethos.\n\nThis was my second visit to Magic Planet, and it was even better than the first. I was pleasantly surprised to learn they no longer charge for entry but instead accept donations.\nHonestly, I feel they should charge for such a fantastic package of entertainment. To show our support for their noble cause—empowering differently-abled children and street magicians—my family and I happily donated ₹1000 per person.\n\nThe food options were simple and average: a Kerala style basic veg meal and chicken biryani.\n\nIn a world full of commercial attractions, Magic Planet stands out as a beacon of hope and humanity.\n\nA full five stars and our highest recommendation!"

It's not a very large lighthouse, but the view from the top is incredible. You get a 360-degree panoramic view of the Arabian Sea, nearby beaches, and the surrounding greenery.\n\nThe climb to the top is short but steep—around 140 steps and a narrow spiral staircase at the end. It’s manageable for most people, and totally worth it for the scenery. The breeze up there is refreshing, especially around sunset.\n\nThe lighthouse is well-maintained and there’s a small museum that gives you some interesting background on maritime history and navigation. Staff were polite and helpful.\n\nPro tip: Try to go during clear weather, preferably in the late afternoon, and bring your camera—the sunset view is unforgettable!\n\nEntry Fee: Very reasonable (₹20–₹30 when I visited).\nTiming: Check before going, as it sometimes closes around noon and reopens in the afternoon.\nParking: Available nearby.\n\nHighly recommended if you're in the area and want to enjoy a peaceful spot with a stunning view. 🌅"

The view from the top is really splendid but it closes by 5 pm so you can only enjoy it in the day light. The way to the top of the lighthouse is very narrow and claustrophobic (it has a lift also) and can get really crowded and one may have to wait a minimum of 40 to 50 mins just to get down from the tower. So better go when the crowd is less. Otherwise it's just too good to admire it from a distance with the scenic ocean view and scintillating winds and waves. 🌊🏖️🪸🐟The entry fees is 30 which adds Rs 10 as extra fee for photography."

The ambience was pleasant, and the surroundings were clean, neat, and well kept.\n\nThe staff were friendly and welcoming, which added positively to the experience. Unlike many tourist spots, it wasn't overcrowded, so we could take our time exploring the area and enjoying the views. Parking was easy and convenient, with enough space and no hassle, which is a big plus.\n\nThe entry ticket was reasonably priced, making it accessible for everyone. The area around the lighthouse is quite spacious, but unfortunately, the space doesn’t seem to be fully utilized. There is a lot of untapped potential here if developed properly with some tourist-friendly additions like a café, souvenir shop, or seating/viewing areas, it could become a major attraction.\n\nOne of the best highlights was the view from the top of the lighthouse absolutely breathtaking! You get a panoramic view of the sea and coastline, and it’s definitely worth the visit just for that. It was also great to see that the top area was clean, safe, and well maintained. For those who may find climbing stairs difficult, there is a lift facility, which is very thoughtful and convenient.\n\nOne drawback, however, was that digital payments were not accepted. In today’s time, especially at tourist spots, having UPI or card options is expected and would greatly help both local and international visitors. Overall, a great place to visit with potential for more. A little more development and modernization especially with facilities like digital payment would take this destination to the next level.\n\nIn summary, Vizhinjam Lighthouse is a great spot to visit if you're in the area. It offers peace, scenic views, and a clean environment. With some improvements in utilizing the available space and adding a few more attractions or amenities, this place can easily become a top tier tourist destination."

The same bhagawathy concept is worshipped here in three aspects such as goddesses saraswathy, lakshmi and durga. The idol of karikakath amma as the deity is so called is made of panchaloha placed gracefully in the sanctum sanctum enabling a smooth darshan from a distance itself. The two sub shrines adjacent to the main deity, raktha chamundi in fierce form and balachamundi in peaceful form placed in wall paintings kept closed and will be opened for a few seconds as offerings known as 'nada thurapikal' is mostly sought by devotees coming here. Beautifully placed here sub idols of mahaganapathi, dharmasastha, bhuvaneswari, ayiravelliswarar lord Shiva, nagarajavu, guru and manthramoorthy. The most outstanding side of this temple is that all the deities are well placed and can be worshipped very conveniently in a peaceful manner without any disturbance of pulling out by securities. Pongala is the main ritual held in malayalam month of meenam annually with much fanfare and high devotee participation and is one of the popular religious ceremonies in thiruvananthapuram. Temple located   nearby technopark, infosys, akulam lake, lulu mall, north railway station and airport.  Bus services available. Vast parking area. No dress code. Flowers, oil, incense sticks, camphor etc to the temple available. Food outlets nearby totally unhygienic. Pilgrim groups can take rest and have toilet facilities here."

              "reviewText": "The Karikkakom Sree Chamundi Temple transcends conventional religious architecture to constitute a profound spiritual nexus whose transformative influence resonates deeply within every visitor. This sacred precinct functions as a repository of concentrated divine energy, orchestrating an encounter that synthesizes transcendental serenity with profound emotional resonance.\n\nTheological Dimensions and Atmospheric Qualities: The temple's distinctive theological framework centers upon the veneration of Goddess Chamundi manifested through three discrete incarnations, each commanding individual sanctuaries. Devotees encounter the formidable, sanguinary presence of Raktha Chamundi, the benevolent protective essence of Maha Chamundi, and the nurturing maternal embodiment of Bala Chamundi. This tripartite devotional structure presents an extraordinarily rare phenomenological experience. The ambient atmosphere achieves a palpable saturation of devotional intensity, while an immediate sense of profound tranquility envelops visitors upon entering the sacred boundaries.\n\nArchitectural Heritage and Stewardship: The structure exemplifies Kerala's architectural traditions through sophisticated timber craftsmanship and canonical spatial organization that cultivates reverent contemplation. Maintenance standards demonstrate exceptional rigor, while administrative protocols ensure remarkable organizational discipline even during periods of substantial congregational attendance. The temple trust demonstrates commendable dedication to preserving both the sanctity and cultural patrimony of this venerated site.\n\nRitual Practices and Devotional Expression: Observing the profound spiritual commitment of the devotees constitutes a remarkable anthropological study. Many undertake the demanding \"Dandanamaskaram\"—a circumambulatory prostration ritual that manifests extraordinary devotional dedication. Ceremonial observances proceed with meticulous precision and genuine reverence. Visitation during Tuesdays or Fridays, deemed particularly auspicious for Devi worship, provides optimal exposure to the temple's complete devotional intensity, albeit with correspondingly increased attendance.\n\nWhether one approaches as a committed devotee seeking divine intervention, a spiritual practitioner pursuing contemplative solitude, or a cultural observer investigating regional heritage, Karikkakom Temple delivers an indelible experiential encounter. For visitors to Thiruvananthapuram seeking authentic engagement with potent divine presence and witnessing faith in its most distilled expression, this institution demands unqualified endorsement."

The maintenance and lighting are good, creating a decent atmosphere.  However, the ₹100 entry fee feels quite steep for what’s offered. The entire museum can be explored in under 10 minutes, with limited interactive elements . While the wax figures are  impressive, the overall experience doesn’t justify the price compared to larger, more engaging attractions. A lower ticket price  would make it more reasonable. The staffs were very friendly and attentive."

The atmosphere is exceptional, amplifying the visual appeal of each display. Participating in a guided tour proves to be more fulfilling than exploring independently, as there is a wealth of history and interesting facts associated with each item. It typically requires over an hour and a half to thoroughly appreciate every artifact, but the experience is undoubtedly worthwhile. The visit was captivating. The palace, constructed by Maharaja Swathi Thirunal, provides an in-depth exploration of Kerala’s historical and cultural landscape. The wooden architecture, elaborate carvings, and particularly the distinctive horse motifs (which lend the palace its name) are breathtaking. Strolling through the palace felt akin to traveling back in time, with exquisite artifacts, paintings, and royal memorabilia offering insights into the life of the Travancore royal family. The guides were well-informed and contributed essential context to the exhibits, rendering the tour both educational and engaging. Although photography is prohibited, which may disappoint some visitors, it serves to protect the artifacts. In summary, Kuthiramalika is an essential destination for those passionate about history and architecture. Puthen Malika Palace, also referred to as Puthen Malika Museum, is an essential site to visit in Thiruvananthapuram! This magnificent palace, erected in the 19th century, exemplifies the stunning architecture of Kerala and its rich royal heritage. The intricate wooden carvings and beautiful murals are visually captivating. Every corner narrates a story, and one can truly appreciate the craftsmanship that went into its creation."

Guide available and they'll tell you about everything. The ticket cost 70/- and with chithralayam ticket it's 100. Old sculptures, guns, decorative items and things used in the palace iss kept here. Some of them is over 1000 years old and it's really exciting to visit to such a place. Overall enjoyed a lot. The inside photography cost 500 and I think that's reasonable, if all the items is real!! And I don't understand why 50 rupees for outside photography. Because you can click photos without a ticket, there's no one there to question it or asking ticket for photography outside. So I think that's not necessary at all. Overall a good experience. You can visit there sometime while visiting sreepadmanabha swmy temple, it situated nearly, especially if you're an history buff."

Perched roughly 300 ft above sea level, it features a rare 9th-century CE rock-cut Shiva temple that’s hewn directly into granite—complete with an ardha-mandapa, pillared facade, and a rock-carved linga within  . Ancient Vattezhuthu inscriptions adorn a pillar, reflecting its cultural importance  .\n\nBelieved to have origins linked to Buddhist or Jain monks, the site may mark the transformation of earlier monastic caves into Hindu worship spaces between the 8th and 10th centuries  . Visitors ascend a mix of roughly 200 rock-carved steps—some natural inclines, some vertical carvings—to reach the shrine  .\n\nToday, the hilltop is a family-friendly getaway: a scenic 100 m bamboo bridge and huts offer panoramic views, complemented by a children’s park, swings, and a sacred pond known as Ganga Theertham  . A Redditor in r/Trivandrum shared:\n\n> “Sometimes may be good, sometimes may be shit.”\n\nreferring to the bamboo path's unpredictable state—though many praise it as a fantastic sunset vantage point  .\n\nManaged by the State Archaeology Department since 1960, Madavoorpara is free to visit (open morning-6.30 PM; closed Mondays; bridge hours vary)  . It’s accessible via road from Sreekariyam, and lies ~20 km from Trivandrum's airport and ~17 km from the central railway station  .\n\nWhether drawn by spiritual reflection, history, or a peaceful sunset, Madavoorpara offers a refreshing escape that gracefully blends heritage with natural beauty."

The place is open from 10 AM to 6:30 PM, but we recommend visiting after 4 PM to avoid the scorching sun.\n\nThe path to the hilltop is moderately steep but has a good grip, making it easy to walk. There’s also a paved staircase for added convenience.\n\nAt the top, there’s a small restaurant where we enjoyed some delicious ice cream. For families, there's a children’s park where kids can play. One of the main attractions is a long bamboo bridge—it was an awesome experience walking through it. We spent an hour sitting on the rocks, soaking in the stunning valley view and lush greenery.\n\nOverall, it’s a fantastic place to relax with your family. Highly recommended!"

Shrine with lord parasurama as deity an avatar of lord mahavishnu.This is the temple popular for bali tharpanam rites and prayers for the peace of ancestors souls and to get rid of paternal curse. Such rites for the salvation of souls are  performed on normal days and on monthly amavasi days. Believers not performing any tharpanam or thilahomam can have darshan of the deities. This is the temple known for performing the karkida vavu balitharpanam and remembarance day rites. Sayoojya pooja, brahmana bhojanam, annadhanam can also be done. The paternal rituals are conducted individually and in a group. Sub idols here are of lord brahma, lord mahavishnu, lord paramashiva, lord vinayagar, lord muruga, goddess bhadrakali and vedavyasa. Shrine of lord sastha is on a top rock structure not well maintained. Despite having high footfall devotees are not provided with good infrastructure facilities. The tiruvallam river before the temple in which devotees have to take a holy dip is contaminated and maligned as the temple management have no regard to faith. The road leading to the temple from the highway not yet developed and to reach the temple by car or by walk is congested. Car parking provided inside. Dress code apply in this temple, gents to wear dhotis without upper wears and womens traditional attires. Airport terminal 2 and north railway station nearby. By road reach near thiruvallam bridge on the kovalam highway and deviate to the service road, better to follow google maps. Reliable details of legends and pujas are on temple website and don't blindly follow youtube which may be misleading."

The calm atmosphere, traditional Kerala temple architecture, and the sacredness of the rituals performed here make it a must-visit for devotees and those seeking peace. It is believed to be the only major temple in Kerala dedicated to Lord Parashurama, and many people perform \"bali\" (ancestral offerings) here, especially during Karkidakam and Tharpanam days. The surroundings are clean and well-maintained. A truly divine experience and a great place to connect with Kerala’s spiritual and cultural roots."

Also it is inside a building so he will be able to walk a lot without much crowd. We went on a Saturday and rainy day. There was very little crowd almost 20 people or so. He loved the exhibits especially the wild animals but was afraid of the skeletons. He ran a lot from one exhibit to another and would address most birds as crow. He knew lion tiger and giraffe from his soft toys. Everything except snake and giraffe are stuffed live animals. They have maintained it well. Really good and would suggest others to see it"

Located near the zoo and Napier Museum, it’s surrounded by trees and gardens that give a calm feeling even before you enter.\n\nInside, the museum is well-organised with separate sections for birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, fossils, and tribal life. You’ll see lifelike models of animals, skeletons, and preserved specimens displayed with proper descriptions. One of the most interesting parts is the fossil gallery, which includes ancient tree trunks and other rare finds.\n\nThe building itself has an old charm, and the exhibits are arranged in a way that makes it easy to walk through and learn. It’s a good place for kids and students, but adults who enjoy learning will also find it engaging. It usually takes around one to two hours to see everything.\n\nPhotography is not allowed inside, and there is no cafeteria, but the museum is clean and the staff are helpful. There’s also a small garden with dinosaur statues that adds a playful touch, especially for children.\n\nIf you enjoy learning about nature or want to spend a quiet and meaningful afternoon in the city, this is definitely a good place to visit."

As a history enthusiast, I was blown away by the vast collection of artifacts and exhibits that showcase the rich cultural and natural heritage of Kerala.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped inside, I was struck by the stunning architecture of the building itself, which is a beautiful blend of traditional and modern styles. The museum's layout is thoughtfully designed, making it easy to navigate and explore the various galleries.\n\nThe exhibits are incredibly well-curated, with detailed labels and descriptions that provide a wealth of information about each artifact. I was particularly fascinated by the ancient stone sculptures, bronze idols, and traditional Kerala murals on display. The museum's collection of tribal artifacts and traditional crafts was also impressive, offering a glimpse into the lives of Kerala's indigenous communities.\n\nWhat I appreciated most about this museum was the way it weaves together the natural and cultural history of the region. The exhibits on Kerala's flora and fauna, including the stunning taxidermy displays, were just as engaging as the historical and anthropological exhibits. It was amazing to see how the museum highlights the interconnectedness of human and natural history.\n\nThe staff were friendly and knowledgeable, and the museum's facilities were clean and well-maintained. Overall, I would highly recommend the Natural History Museum in Trivandrum to anyone interested in history, culture, or the natural world."

The architecture is simply beautiful both grand and graceful. Inside, the church is very spacious and peaceful. Even just sitting there in silence feels calming and meaningful. There's a divine atmosphere that surrounds you the moment you step in.\n\nOne of the hidden gems here is the underground museum. It's a fascinating space where you can explore many things from the robes and belongings of the priests to beautiful depictions of Jesus and elements of church history. It adds depth to the visit and gives a sense of spiritual and cultural richness.\n\nThe church is located near the sea, adding to its serene charm. A walk by the shore makes the experience even more special. The only downside is transportatio buses are often overcrowded and uncomfortable. But if you're coming by private vehicle, the trip is much easier and more enjoyable.\n\nTruly a place worth visiting!"

The traditional Kerala charm beautifully blends with European architecture, evident in its stained glass windows, intricate woodwork, and grandeur altar. The calm and peaceful environment is perfect for reflection, especially in the evenings when the lights and beach breeze elevate the ambiance.\n\nI visited with my family for the Sunday morning prayer, and it was truly an energizing and soul-soothing experience. The prayer session was heartfelt and powerful—it gave me strength and clarity for the days ahead. I poured out my sorrows and heartfelt emotions before God, and I left with a deep sense of peace and blessing. It’s a place where you truly feel heard.\n\nA small museum near the church displays fascinating artifacts from the church’s past, offering insights into Kerala’s Christian heritage. Being close to the beach, the surroundings make the visit even more relaxing, though beach access may be tricky.\n\nWhether you’re visiting for spiritual reasons or to admire its architectural beauty, Vettukad Church is a highly recommended destination. No reservations or long wait times—just pure, peaceful devotion.\n\nParking is a challenge there. Very limited public parking ."

It’s not one of those massive royal palaces, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in charm and history.\n\nThe building itself is this beautiful old Kerala-style structure with sloping tiled roofs and wooden beams—super traditional and photogenic. You can literally feel the history in the air. It was built way back in the 1600s.\n\nInside, there are museums. The Folklore Museum has some really cool stuff like old musical instruments, traditional lamps, costumes, and even tools people used ages ago. On the ground floor is the coin museum, Ancient coins collections are there. The place isn’t crowded at all—perfect if you want a quiet, thoughtful afternoon. The gardens around the palace are also nice, and it’s a great spot if you’re into photography, culture, or just want a chill outing away from the usual city spots."

It mostly feels like a regular exhibition. If you’ve been to the Keralam History and Heritage Museum, the vibe is pretty similar — except the Keralam Museum has more stunning sculptures, cave paintings, and artistic displays. That said, Koyikkal Palace does have a few things that make it unique. I won’t spoil anything, but there are some interesting elements that are worth checking out. I still encourage everyone to visit it at least once. I went today, and I was the only visitor there 😅 — which actually made the experience even better.You can ask the staff more about the palace’s history or even the rumored stories connected to it — they’re usually happy to share. Entry is super affordable: just ₹30 for adults, ₹10 if you want to use your phone camera, and ₹150 extra if you’re planning to take videos or reels.\n\nSo yeah, not mind-blowing, but peaceful, low-key interesting, and worth a visit if you're into heritage spots."

From the outset, they took the time to understand my requirements and provided a detailed estimate. On the day of the event, they arrived punctually and skillfully captured every aspect of the function.\n\nWhat truly stood out was their commitment to delivering exceptional quality. The use of helicam, drones, and accessories during the home tour photography session showcased their innovative approach. They expertly covered every highlight of my house and its surroundings, leaving no stone unturned.\n\nWithin just days, SOL Brothers delivered the photos, allowing me to select images for the album and home tour. The results were nothing short of breathtaking; they managed to encapsulate our most cherished moments in a truly memorable way.\n\nBut their efforts didn't stop there. I was pleasantly surprised when they went the extra mile, providing alternate versions of the home tour and even crafting a personalized calendar featuring our special moments. This attention to detail truly made the experience exceptional.\n\nFrom the very first interaction with Arun, where our discussion began, to Asha, who remained our constant point of contact throughout the process, the experience with SOL Brothers has been exceptional. Arun's clear understanding of my requirements and the detailed estimate provided a solid foundation for the project. Asha's consistent communication and coordination ensured a smooth journey from the event day to the final product.\n\nIn conclusion, my experience with SOL Brothers has been nothing short of outstanding. From Arun to Asha and the entire team, their combined efforts have resulted in a remarkable representation of our special moments. With gratitude, I highly recommend SOL Brothers for their unmatched skill, professionalism, and the ability to transform precious memories into timeless treasures."

Perfect for families, the park offers a serene floating bridge with stunning views and a unique lake-sea confluence. The solar-powered toy train is a delightful 2.5-km ride, winding through lush greenery, captivating both kids and adults. Boating—pedal boats (₹100 for 30 mins, 2-seater) and speed boats (₹700-1000 for 4-6 people)—is a highlight, though rides can feel short. The children’s park, with swings, slides, and Kanayi Kunhiraman’s sculptures, adds charm.\nFood options, like the KTDC floating restaurant, serve decent South Indian fare but are limited and pricey. Entry is affordable (₹5-30), with parking at ₹10-20. However, litter and broken equipment detract from the experience, and crowds swell in evenings. Adding water sports like kayaking could boost appeal. Overall, a relaxing half-day outing with great potential—better maintenance would help. I"

There's also a clean park for kids and fun activities like pedal boats and a toy train. The nearby beach is quiet and scenic, great for sunsets. Only downside is a bit of plastic waste in some areas. Still, a great place for families and evening visits!"

It's offers various activities including a kid's playground, landscaped garden, sculpture, horse riding, boating, toy train ride etc. The train ride was amazing. It goes around the park including bridge and pond. A nice walkway bridge over the water and a beautiful garden, there are some seats to rest and enjoy the lush greenery. Also the lakeside path you can see the panoramic views of the surroundings and enjoy the cool breeze of the backwater.\nWell organized facilities, beautiful scenery and fun activities make you a perfect spot to spend time with family and friends, especially children.

It looks like a lot changed.\n\nVeli tourist village is mainly for kids with couple of parks, miniature train ride, hourse ride, etc..\n\nIt's a good place for a walk with scenic beauty. The pathways and grass are well maintained.\n\nFloating restaurant was closed by mentioning renovation but cant see any renovation work going on. I saw a bio toilet but doesn't seems to be working. floating bridge also require some maintenance. In kids park also some equipments are damaged but not yet repaired. So there are some areas were no maintenance are being done."

It is different from other mosques.\n\nIt is beautifully constructed and is light pink in colour.\n\nThe Beemapally Dargah Shareef houses the tomb of Syedunnisa Beema Beevi. She is believed to have divine powers.\n\nIt is recommended to visit the mosque mornings or evenings or as usual timings to pray.\n\nThe mosque is famous for its annual Urus that is festivals to venerate Beema Beevi at which people from all customs and faiths jointly participate. The festival begins with the hoisting of the flag of the mosque. During the festivals many programmes like Islamic devotional songs, Duff muttu etc are also conducted. The Chandanakudam Mahotsavam marks the end of the festival at which the flag from the Beema Beevis grave is taken and a grand procession of elephants along with the panchavadyam music takes place. The panchavadyam includes Timila, Maddalam, Ilathalam, Kombu and Idakka.\n\nThe mosque environment is maintained well.\n\nIt is just 5-6 kilometres away from the Thampanoor or Thiruvananthapuram City. The mosque was built in the  1960s and completed with nearly 18 years of construction which made it an architectural marvel.\n\nThere are also many small shops for food and toys nearby which can be utilised by the visitors to buy toys and all for the children. Thus during the next visit to Trivandum one can visit the place and see it."

We moved on and went to the space museum where we had terribly bad treatment from the explanation staff of exhibits they rushed the whole thing because there was a high profile person visiting just after us in the theatre show they made us and the teachers stand while keeping an entire side of 50-60 seats for the  3 persons visiting.They didn't even care about even showing the last part and just rushed us out . The most reputed institution couldn't afford well behaved staff? We were utterly disappointed in the behaviour and when we complained the cisf officers supported but the mueseum in charge nearly verbally abused the coordinator teacher .very sad moreover just try to care more for the enthusiastic people who come there"

              "reviewText": "The main entrance to Kanakakunnu Palace and Nishagandhi Auditorium feels grand yet welcoming. Set along a tree-lined road, the entrance opens into a spacious compound that brings together culture, history, and calm surroundings. The wide gate and well-kept path give a royal touch that hints at the heritage of the place.\n\nOnce you walk in, you are greeted by open grounds, flowering plants, and a clean environment that makes it easy to forget the busy city just outside. The palace stands elegantly in the background, while the Nishagandhi Auditorium sits to one side, known for hosting classical dance and music performances. During festivals and cultural events, this area becomes lively and full of energy. At other times, it remains peaceful and perfect for an evening walk or quiet visit.\n\nThere are benches, open lawns, and clear signage, making the area accessible and comfortable for all ages. You will often see families, joggers, and tourists spending time here. The location is also popular for photo walks and small gatherings.\n\nSecurity staff are present at the gate, and the whole space is generally well maintained. Entry is usually free, and the timings extend into the late evening, making it a good spot for both day visits and nighttime strolls.\n\nThis entrance is not just a way in. It sets the tone for the calm and culturally rich experience that follows. Whether you are visiting for an event or just to enjoy the quiet beauty of the surroundings, this is a place that blends heritage with simplicity in the best way."

It’s a nice spot for a walk, photography, or attending cultural events. However, there’s not much to see inside unless there’s an exhibition or program happening. The place could use better maintenance and more visitor facilities. A good place to relax, but not very engaging for tourists expecting an in-depth historical experience."

It's really a divine place and you get to see the lord Vishnu in a resting posture and the spirituality, architecture, cleanliness, security and the experience is top notch.\n\nI took the vip darshan with a ₹500 ticket and with this you can get the closest to the idol. I went at 8 am and you can enter through any of the four gates. Tickets are avilable inside the temple. After security check at the entrance head straight to the ticket counter and then joined the queue. Within 30 mins I was infront of lord Vishnu and asked for his blessings. No rush, no pushing and ample time in front of the idol was allowed. Post the darshana, I got prasadam which was included in the ticket price. Then visited lord Ganesha as well which is withing the temple complex. My heart and mind was at peace and I sat there admiring the temple architecture and beauty.\n\nTemple timing are displayed at the entrance and special puja ticket of around ₹3000 is also available. Best time for free darshana is to go early morning when the temple opens at 3am.\n\nAlso please note that dress code need to be strictly followed and no electronic item are allowed inside the temple. You get locker and  bathing facility at nominal rates."

Renowned for its Dravidian architecture and spiritual significance, the temple is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu. The temple's main deity is composed of 12,008 saligrams, fossilized shells from the Gandaki River in Nepal, and is preserved using a unique Ayurvedic mixture called \"Katusarkara yogam\" .\n\nThe temple is also famous for its treasure vaults, which were discovered to contain immense wealth, including gold, jewels, and artifacts, making it one of the richest temples in the world . In June 2025, the temple hosted a rare Maha Kumbhabhishekam, a consecration ritual conducted after nearly 270 years, marking a significant event in its history .\n\nVisitors are required to adhere to a strict dress code: men must wear a white dhoti with an angavastram, and women should wear a sari. Entry is permitted only to Hindus, as per the Temple Entry Proclamation . The temple opens for darshan at 3:15 am and closes at 7:20 pm, with various slots for prayers and rituals throughout the day .\n\nWhile the temple offers a profound spiritual experience, some visitors have reported issues such as overcrowding and lack of proper guidance for tourists . Additionally, the temple's treasure vaults have been a subject of legal and spiritual debates, adding to its mystique and intrigue .\n\nOverall, Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple stands as a testament to Kerala's rich cultural and spiritual heritage, offering visitors a glimpse into the region's deep-rooted traditions and beliefs."

It's really a divine place and you get to see the lord Vishnu in a resting posture and the spirituality, architecture, cleanliness, security and the experience is top notch.\n\nI took the vip darshan with a ₹500 ticket and with this you can get the closest to the idol. I went at 8 am and you can enter through any of the four gates. Tickets are avilable inside the temple. After security check at the entrance head straight to the ticket counter and then joined the queue. Within 30 mins I was infront of lord Vishnu and asked for his blessings. No rush, no pushing and ample time in front of the idol was allowed. Post the darshana, I got prasadam which was included in the ticket price. Then visited lord Ganesha as well which is withing the temple complex. My heart and mind was at peace and I sat there admiring the temple architecture and beauty.\n\nTemple timing are displayed at the entrance and special puja ticket of around ₹3000 is also available. Best time for free darshana is to go early morning when the temple opens at 3am.\n\nAlso please note that dress code need to be strictly followed and no electronic item are allowed inside the temple. You get locker and  bathing facility at nominal rates."
