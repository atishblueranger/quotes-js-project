Walking around feels like stepping into the past, with old temples, detailed carvings, and historic buildings all around. It’s a mix of beautiful architecture, religion, and local life.\n\nThe square is full of energy, with locals, tourists, and pigeons all sharing the space.\n\nSome areas are still under repair from the 2015 earthquake, but the square’s charm and importance are still strong. There’s a ticket fee for foreigners, so be ready for that. A must-visit place to experience the spirit of old Kathmandu."

Photos could not capture the feeling of walking through and seeing them in real. There are lots of little cultural things happening that make you feel like you have a front-row seat to Nepalese tradition. There is also an outdoor area with rows of stalls where you can buy souvenirs. Keep in mind the main museum closes early (5pm) so it's better to visit during the day. So far this is the one place I wouldn't mind revisiting on my Kathmandu trip."

              "reviewText": "Kathmandu Durbar Square, also known as Basantapur Durbar Square, is a place where the soul of old Kathmandu still lingers. Located in the heart of the city, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a vibrant reminder of Nepal’s rich royal past. As you wander through the narrow, lively alleys that lead to the square, you’re instantly transported to a different era—one of kings, courtiers, rituals, and artistic brilliance.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you is the stunning architecture. The square is a collection of temples, shrines, courtyards, and palaces—each unique, yet harmoniously woven together. Most of these monuments date back to the Malla period, when Kathmandu’s art and architecture flourished. At the heart of it all lies the Hanuman Dhoka Palace, once home to the kings of Kathmandu. Though much of it now functions as a museum, its historic character and the stories it holds are very much alive. Walking through its courtyards, hearing your footsteps echo on the stone floors, you can almost imagine the royal processions and festivals that once took place here.\n\nOne of the most fascinating attractions is the Kumari Ghar—the residence of the Living Goddess, Kumari. This tradition, where a young girl is worshipped as the embodiment of divine power, is unique to Nepal. If you're fortunate, you may get a glimpse of the Kumari as she appears briefly at a window to bless visitors. Her presence adds an element of living spirituality to the square that few places in the world can match.\n\nAnother highlight is the Taleju Temple, the tallest structure in the square. Although only Hindus may enter, its towering presence is awe-inspiring. Nearby stands the massive statue of Kal Bhairav, a fierce manifestation of Lord Shiva. Even today, devotees come to pray here, showing that the square is not just a historical attraction but a spiritual center for locals.\n\nThough the 2015 earthquake damaged several temples, restoration efforts have been impressive. Craftsmen are using traditional methods and materials to rebuild the temples as authentically as possible. This dedication to preservation adds even more depth to the experience—you’re witnessing a culture that not only values its history but actively works to protect and revive it.\n\nWhat makes Kathmandu Durbar Square truly special is the way it blends the past with the present. The temples and palaces may be centuries old, but the square is alive. Children chase pigeons across the stones, elders rest on temple steps, and vendors sell incense, jewelry, and snacks. It’s not a museum behind glass—it’s a space where life still unfolds, just as it has for generations.\n\nWhether you're a history buff, a photographer, a culture lover, or just a curious traveler, Kathmandu Durbar Square has something to offer. It’s more than a tourist site—it’s the living heart of old Kathmandu. Take your time here, let the square unfold its stories, and you’ll leave with a deeper appreciation for the soul of Nepal."

It’s a beautifully maintained garden with lush greenery, charming fountains, and enough tranquility to make you forget you're in the middle of a vibrant city. Seriously, it's like stepping into a different world where the sound of traffic is replaced by the gentle rustling of leaves.\n\nYes, you do have to pay an entrance fee, but trust me, it’s totally worth it. For what you get – a serene escape, clean spaces, and a well-maintained garden – it's a small price to pay. Plus, the extra fee is totally justified by the delightful experience of being able to kick back and enjoy the surroundings without the usual Kathmandu chaos.\n\nThe garden also has a café where you can grab a drink or bite to eat. Now, fair warning, it's on the pricier side (for Kathmandu standards), but I guess you’re paying for the peaceful vibes and the fact that you're sitting in the only place that feels this calm and relaxed in the city. Still, it’s a lovely spot to sip on something cool or enjoy a snack.\n\nFor those looking for a productive escape, this could be the perfect place to study or read a book – it's quiet enough to concentrate, and the surrounding beauty might just inspire you. It’s a good spot for both relaxing and getting some serious work done.\n\nAll in all, a hidden gem in Kathmandu that’s definitely worth checking out!"

The Garden of Dreams is beautifully maintained with elegant landscaping, historic architecture, and a calm vibe that makes it perfect for a short escape from the city's chaos. The fountains, pavilions, and shaded benches offer a relaxing environment, ideal for reading, journaling, or simply unwinding.\n\nThe entry fee feels a bit high for locals, and the café inside, while nice, is slightly overpriced. Still, the overall experience is worth it, especially if you’re into photography or just want a tranquil spot to recharge. Definitely recommended for a chill afternoon."

And it’s surrounded with buildings, so air isn’t really fresh but understood given that Kathmandu is really populated and polluted. Air is not too refreshing here. Wanted to get out to get some fresh air cause I felt suffocated in the room with no windows.\n\nThey have a cafe and restaurant. Foods were not too good too, can’t taste the cheese in the pizza, so I asked for more grated cheese but still the same, it seems like the cheese has no taste at all. Their ceasar salad is good, but the carrot soup is kinda sweet. Would have been nicer if it’s pure carrot.\n\nI asked if we can ask for a food delivery but they did not allow it. Service is good but they could have served better."

Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this temple is not just a place of worship but also a symbol of faith, culture, and spiritual heritage.\n\nThe temple stands beautifully on the banks of the Bagmati River and is built in the traditional pagoda style with a golden roof, silver-plated doors, and intricately carved wooden pillars. The atmosphere here is filled with the sound of bells, chants, and the fragrance of incense, making the entire complex feel divine and peaceful.\n\nOne of the unique aspects of Pashupatinath is the Bagmati ghats, where Hindu cremation rituals take place daily. It is a powerful reminder of the cycle of life and death, much like the experience in Varanasi. The presence of sadhus in colorful attire and painted faces adds a cultural and spiritual charm to the place.\n\nThe best time to visit is during early mornings or evenings, especially during Maha Shivaratri or Teej festivals when the temple is decorated and the energy is at its peak. Only Hindus are allowed inside the main sanctum, but non-Hindu visitors can still explore the outer complex, the ghats, and the surrounding shrines.\n\nFacilities for pilgrims are well arranged with guest houses, hotels, and small eateries nearby. Inside the temple premises, stalls provide flowers, prasad, and puja items. Photography is restricted inside the main temple but is allowed outside in the surrounding areas.\n\nOverall, visiting Pashupatinath Temple is a deeply moving and unforgettable experience. It combines devotion, spirituality, history, and culture in one place. Whether you are a believer or a traveler seeking peace, this temple leaves you with a sense of connection to something eternal."

              "reviewText": "I took a 10-day course and it was life-changing. Very good teachings and meditations. All Monks are very nice and welcoming (the opposite is almost impossible when it comes to Monks anyway!). You quickly feel at home at the Monastery. The peacefulness and the view of the city and mountains make it even more special. The Monastery also has a restaurant/coffee shop, a convenience store, and a library you can go to during your breaks.\n\nI never thought I'd sleep well in a dormitory but I did, and I think it actually makes the experience better to be with other people in your room in this case. I've met people from all around the world, and everyone has their own special reason as to why they are attending the course.\n\n*ADVICE*: The food is very tasty and you can eat as much as you want. But a lot of us were sick (from above or from down there, if you get what I mean) while we were over there. I'm not sure why; it's tough to pinpoint one thing, but my guess is that, even though they provide us as much filtered water as we want to drink, they may be using tap water to cook. Again, I'm not sure. Also, there was barely any protein in any meal we ate the whole time (mainly carbs (bread, noodles, potatoes) and veggies), so your body lacks the energy to fight whatever foreign bacteria you're trying to digest. So my tip would be: bring some medicine for this just in case and bring something with protein to eat on the side. There is a doctor on-site but he might not have all the medicine you need or want. But don't let this discourage you from going if you can; just be well-prepared. This is still a wonderful experience."

For me the best time to visit is in the evening when the stupa glows under soft lights, and the ambiance becomes even more serene. The area is lined with numerous restaurants and coffee shops, serving everything from international dishes to authentic Tibetan cuisine. While the atmosphere is relaxing, finding a parking spot can be a challenge."

The stupa is massive and beautifully maintained, surrounded by prayer wheels, monasteries, and local shops. I loved walking clockwise around the stupa with locals and pilgrims—it felt like a spiritual reset.\n\nThe air is filled with the scent of incense, the sound of chanting, and the flutter of prayer flags. There are also lovely rooftop cafés nearby where you can sit, sip tea, and take it all in from above.\n\nHighly recommend making time for this if you’re ever in Kathmandu."

The architecture is stunning, and the surrounding area is full of energy with street vendors and tourists. It’s easy to spend a couple of hours here wandering around and soaking in the history of the place.\n\nIf you’re into photography or just love history, Hanuman Dhoka is a fantastic spot. The palace is beautiful, and you can learn a lot about Nepal’s kings and the country’s past. It’s also located right in the middle of Durbar Square, so there’s plenty to do around it. It’s definitely worth a visit if you’re in the area."

The collection of artifacts inside cover a huge range of items and time periods showcasing the breadth and depth of Nepal’s cultural history.

Every brick, every carving tells a story. The Patan Museum was the highlight for me—beautifully curated, peaceful, and rich with Newari art and history. It’s a place where you don’t just see culture, you feel it.\n\nThe intricate woodwork, ancient courtyards, and spiritual energy make it a must-visit for anyone who loves history, photography, or just wants a break from the modern chaos.\n\nSharing some snapshots I took—they barely do justice, but I hope they inspire someone else to explore this gem. Highly recommend going early in the morning for that golden light and fewer crowds!"

We were guided through the square’s intricate temples, courtyards, and museums, gaining valuable insights into Newar architecture, art, and the rich heritage of the Malla period. Each part of the visit added a new layer to our understanding of the area's historical and cultural importance.\n\nThe experience was well-organized, and we truly appreciated the effort put into ensuring that we learned as much as possible. It was more than just a visit—it was a learning journey that left us with a deeper appreciation for Nepal’s history and craftsmanship.\n\nHighly recommended for students, researchers, or anyone interested in history, art, and architecture.

The architecture is a beautiful example of traditional Newar woodwork and design, with carved windows, ornate courtyards, and the recently opened Sundari Chowk featuring the 17th‑century royal bath, Tusha Hiti, complete with stone and gilt imagery of Hindu gods and Nāgas .\n\nBoasting over 1,100 artifacts, about 200 are on permanent display, including cast bronze sculptures and gilt copper repoussé works that reflect centuries of Hindu and Buddhist devotion and artistry  ￼. The collection spans from the medieval Malla period through later eras, offering both iconic statues and explanatory captions that connect graphics to meaning."

              "reviewText": "I visited the Patan Museum, and from the moment I entered, the atmosphere felt rich with history. Located in the old Malla royal palace, the architecture alone is worth the visit intricate wood carvings, traditional Newari brickwork, and serene courtyards that reflect centuries of craftsmanship. The restoration has been done with great care, preserving the authenticity while making the space easy to explore.\n\nThe galleries display an impressive collection of artifacts, focusing on Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Bronze statues, gilt-copper repoussé works, and ancient religious iconography are arranged in a way that tells a clear story of Nepal’s spiritual and artistic heritage. Informative descriptions accompany each piece, offering context without overwhelming the visitor.\n\nSundari Chowk, with its detailed woodwork and the historic royal bath, stands as a reminder of the palace’s grandeur. Every corner of the museum feels thoughtfully maintained, with a quiet, meditative atmosphere that contrasts with the bustling streets outside.\n\nTime moves slowly inside the museum. Courtyards open into shaded galleries, and each turn reveals another detail of craftsmanship or history. By the time I stepped back into Patan Durbar Square, it felt like I had experienced a preserved fragment of Nepal’s past in the heart of a living city."

              "reviewText": "Patan Museum is a famous museum in Lalitpur, Nepal, located inside the beautiful Patan Durbar Square. The museum is set in an old royal palace of the Malla kings and is one of the best places to learn about Nepali art and culture. It was officially opened in 1997 with support from Austria and today it is respected as one of the finest museums in South Asia.\n\nThe museum mainly shows art related to Hinduism and Buddhism. Visitors can see old statues made of bronze, copper, and wood, along with many religious objects. Each display has clear explanations that help people understand the history and meaning behind the artwork. This makes the museum very educational for both students and tourists.\n\nThe building of the museum itself is also very special. The traditional Newar-style architecture, with carved wooden windows, brick walls, and open courtyards, makes the museum look like a piece of art. There is also a peaceful garden and a small café where visitors can relax.\n\nPatan Museum is not only a place to see beautiful objects but also a place to connect with Nepal’s past. It is an important destination for anyone who wants to explore the country’s rich culture and traditions."

              "reviewText": "Narayanhiti Palace Palace is a must-visit for anyone traveling to Kathmandu and interested in Nepal’s rich history. Once the royal palace of the Shah dynasty, it was turned into a public museum after the monarchy ended in 2008. The complex is well-preserved, giving a real glimpse into royal life. Inside, the lavish halls, elegant throne room, and preserved artifacts showcase the luxury and power of Nepal’s former kings.\n\nThe audio guide (available for a small extra fee) is very informative and well worth it. Photography is not allowed inside, which can be disappointing for some, but it helps maintain the palace’s sanctity and historical value. The grounds outside are clean and peaceful with beautiful gardens and fountains — a great place to stroll and take pictures.\n\nLocated in the heart of Kathmandu, it’s easy to reach by taxi or even on foot from Thamel. Entry fees are affordable for Nepali visitors, though a bit higher for foreigners. Plan at least 1-2 hours to explore properly. Overall, Narayanhiti Palace Museum is a fascinating stop for travelers looking to understand Nepal’s royal heritage and political transformation."

Let's have a look at some of the pictures that remind us of an abandoned place of MAHARAJAS. This is an underrated or hidden truth in the heart of Kathmandu City. We need to talk about this side as well. That's why it's three stars only."

              "reviewText": "I recently visited the Narayan Hiti Museum and was absolutely fascinated by the rich history and grandeur preserved within these palace walls. The museum beautifully showcases the legacy of Nepal’s monarchy, offering a rare and intimate look into the royal lifestyle.\n\nFrom royal reception halls to the King’s private chambers, every room tells a story. What truly struck me was the solemn atmosphere around the tragic Royal Massacre site—preserved exactly as it was. It felt surreal and emotional.\n\nI’ve also shared some photos, opening hours, and ticket fees info to help fellow travelers plan better.\n\nHighlights:\n•\tIntricate architecture & vintage interiors\n•\tDetailed exhibits about the monarchy\n•\tWell-maintained and peaceful\n•\tGreat place for history lovers and curious explorers\n\nHighly recommend setting aside at least 1.5 to 2 hours for the full experience. This place is not just a museum—it’s a journey through Nepal’s modern history."

Once the residence of Nepal’s Shah monarchy, the palace was converted into a museum after the monarchy was abolished in 2008.\n\nThe palace’s architecture beautifully blends Western and traditional Nepali styles, with spacious courtyards, elegant gardens, and intricate woodwork. Inside, the museum houses 52 rooms, each named after a district of Nepal, showcasing royal chambers, meeting rooms, and ceremonial halls. The exhibits include portraits, royal artifacts, gifts from foreign dignitaries, and detailed accounts of significant events, including the tragic 2001 royal massacre.\n\nVisitors appreciate the well-maintained exhibits and the informative guided tours, which provide deep insights into the country’s transition from monarchy to republic. However, photography is not allowed inside to protect the artifacts, and all personal items must be left at the entrance.\n\nThe museum is conveniently located in central Kathmandu and is accessible to tourists interested in history and culture. It is open most days except Wednesdays, and it’s advisable to allocate 1.5 to 2 hours for a thorough visit.\n\nOverall, the Narayanhiti Palace Museum is a must-visit for those wanting to understand Nepal’s rich history and royal heritage. It offers an educational and moving experience that connects visitors to Nepal’s past in a meaningful way."

I went twice, be sure to take a guide with you. The history is super amazing. It's a square filled with delicious restaurants.

It's wonderful to see people from all walks of life, locals and visitors alike, congregating here, walking the kora, or simply enjoying the peaceful ambiance. The air is always filled with the gentle hum of prayers, the scent of incense, and a sense of shared tranquility.\n\nAdding to its appeal are the close-by shops and cafes that offer absolutely great food. Whether you're looking for a quick bite or a relaxing meal, there are plenty of delicious options to choose from, making it an ideal place to spend an afternoon or evening.\n\nUltimately, Boudhanath Stupa is a place where you can truly find yourself calm. It's a sacred space that invites introspection and offers a much-needed escape from the hustle and bustle, while also serving as a vibrant community hub. A must-visit for anyone seeking peace, culture, and delicious treats!"

The ambience is inviting, and the staff is incredibly friendly, making the overall experience enjoyable.\n\nThe food is good, though the pricing is slightly higher compared to similar restaurants—something the owner might consider revising. However, what makes this place truly unique is the opportunity to feed the eagles! If you’re looking for a spot with great views and a little adventure, it’s definitely worth a visit."

The pizza could have used more cheese, and the waiter opened our bottled water without asking, resulting in an unexpected charge.\n\nOverall, the restaurant is a decent option for casual outings with friends or couples, but be prepared for crowds on weekends."

Don't blindly follow Google maps like we did, since everyone in my party were shown a much more difficult steep uphill path."

While the airport plays a crucial role in connecting the country to the world, several areas need improvement to enhance the overall passenger experience.\n\nThe check-in process is generally smooth, but long queues at immigration and security checkpoints can cause delays. More efficient crowd management and additional counters could help streamline the process. The airport staff are polite and helpful, but the overall system requires better organization to minimize waiting times.\n\nInfrastructure remains a key concern. The seating arrangements in the departure lounge are limited, making it difficult for passengers to find a comfortable place to rest. Restroom facilities require better maintenance, and baggage claim can be slow, causing inconvenience for travelers.\n\nOn the positive side, basic amenities such as food stalls and duty-free shops are available, though the variety of options is limited. WiFi connectivity can be inconsistent, making it challenging for passengers to stay connected while waiting for their flights.\n\nOverall, Tribhuvan International Airport has the potential to provide a better travel experience with improvements in infrastructure, efficiency, and service quality. Upgrading facilities and enhancing management could significantly enhance convenience for both domestic and international travelers."

The staff at boarding pass counter Ms. Priyanka of Indigo Airlines was so rude and disrespectful and had a behaviour of discrimination for Nepali citizens. Being at a customer service she should have known how to behave with passengers. We were in the front of the queue but stopped us and prioritised Nepali. And usage of words were so improper. I had a very good impression on Nepali people for their humble and down to earth nature. The whole trip to Nepal was so good however the experience at this airport left a tint to the trip. The departure area has got limited seating and couple of outlets for refreshments. Considering the number if increasing passenger traffic the authorities should consider providing extended seating facilities. The stinking rest rooms are to be cleaned at regular frequency. Understand that this is comparitively small airport, however being an international one certain standards are to be maintained."

Toilets are dirty and smell unpleasant, which is quite disappointing for a busy national airport. There is only one screen displaying flight information, making it difficult to keep track of flights unless you’re right in front of it.\n\nSecurity checks begin right at the entrance, including baggage scans and body searches. Also, only passengers are allowed inside the terminal, so family or friends must wait outside regardless of weather conditions.\n\nOn the positive side, the airport does offer free WiFi and there are CCTV cameras installed for safety. The biggest plus was the airport staff—they were very helpful, polite, and professional, which made the experience more bearable despite the outdated facilities.\n\nIn summary, Kathmandu Domestic Airport functions, but just barely. It’s in need of serious renovation and proper maintenance. If you're flying from here, be prepared for minimal comfort and come with low expectations."

So be ready to wait in the long line.\nBehind the security and immigration check you can wait for your departure. There is only one convenience store where is chance to buy simple breakfast or some drinks. Don't expect facilities like on some other airports around the world.\nThe staff was nice and helpful.\nBe sure that your checked language is properly closed with a locker cuz somehow I found my suitcase opened and reorganized when I arrived at my final destination🤷‍♂️\nThank you🤩"

              "reviewText": "Tribhuvan International Airport (TIA), located approximately 5.6 km east of Kathmandu in Nepal’s Kathmandu Valley, is the nation's oldest and only international airport, situated at an altitude of 1,338 m (4,390 ft) above sea level  . Named after King Tribhuvan, it transformed from the early “Gaucharan” pasture to a modern aviation hub inaugurated in the 1950s, officially becoming “Tribhuvan International Airport” in 1964  .\n\nServing as Nepal’s primary gateway to the world, TIA connects Kathmandu to over 25 cities across Asia and the Middle East. It plays a vital role in supporting tourism, trade, migration, and educational travel, bringing visitors to destinations like Mount Everest, Pokhara, and Chitwan National Park  .\n\nTIA comprises a single asphalt runway (designated 02/20), measuring 3,050 m (10,007 ft) and equipped with basic navigation aids including VOR, DME, NDB, and ILS. Due to Nepal’s mountainous terrain and the airport’s plateau location, operations require specialized pilot training and face inherent challenges  .\n\nModern passenger amenities include free Wi‑Fi in the international terminal, self‑check‑in facilities (CUTE systems across 36 counters), currency exchange, ATMs, medical services, information desks, trolley service, duty‑free shops, restaurants, a post office, and police help desks  .\n\nThe airport has historically operated with significant infrastructure constraints: a single runway, limited apron space (accommodating nine medium/wide‑body aircraft and 17 small aircraft), causing congestion and delays especially during peak periods  . To address overcrowding, CAAN launched an Air Transport Capacity Enhancement Project aimed at expanding the international apron, building a parallel taxiway, extending hangar aprons, and refurbishing terminals. As of mid‑2025, about 60–75 % of the project is complete, with full capacity expected by early 2026, boosting passenger handling by approximately 25 %, to around 10 million annually  .\n\nTIA traffic has grown rapidly post‑COVID, handling over 4.54 million international passengers in 2023 and reaching nearly 4.96 million in 2024—a record year with more than 33,000 total flight movements annually  . From January to April 2025 alone, TIA welcomed over 3.13 million travelers across 42,600 flights, including more than 10,300 international and 32,000 domestic movements  .\n\nNotwithstanding the infrastructure upgrades, TIA continues to face safety and operational concerns due to geography, weather, and aging infrastructure. In July 2024, a Saurya Airlines CRJ200 crash shortly after takeoff claimed 18 lives—highlighting Nepal’s ongoing aviation safety challenges and the heightened risks of Kathmandu’s difficult terrain  . Consequently, the European Union continues to ban Nepal‑based airlines, citing safety and regulatory shortcomings  .\n\nDespite these challenges, TIA remains vital to Nepal’s connectivity and economy, and significant investments in expansion and modernization are poised to transform it into a more efficient and capable international gateway."

Constructed in 1564 by King Mahendra Malla, this temple is dedicated to Taleju Bhawani, the royal goddess of the Malla dynasty.  Its architecture showcases a harmonious blend of Newar and pagoda styles, featuring a towering three-tiered structure adorned with intricate wooden carvings and a gilded pinnacle  .\n\nThe temple holds immense religious significance, being accessible to the public only once a year during the Dashain festival, when devotees gather to pay homage to the goddess  . Throughout the rest of the year, visitors can admire its external grandeur and the surrounding historical edifices of the UNESCO World Heritage Site.\n\nLegend speaks of the goddess Taleju appearing to King Mahendra Malla in a dream, instructing him to build the temple.  This divine encounter underscores the temple's spiritual importance and its role in the cultural fabric of Kathmandu  .\n\nA visit to Taleju Temple offers not only a glimpse into Nepal's architectural brilliance but also an opportunity to connect with the profound spiritual traditions that have shaped the nation's history."

              "reviewText": "The Taleju Temple is one of Hanuman Dhoka Darbar Square's oldest structures. A \"great temple\" was built in 1563, under Mahendra Malla's rule, according to ancient diaries (tyasaphus) (r. 1560-74). Four notable structures, including the Jagannath, Kotilingeswar Mahadev, and Mahendreswara temples, are known to have been constructed at Darbar Square under the reign of Mahendra Malla. The Malla period building spree was financed by the kingdom's efforts to issue Tibetan currency for export and increase trade with other Himalayan kingdoms. The temple's current design resembles a cosmic mandala. The main structure has three levels of roofing and is supported by a base with twelve steps that resembles Mount Meru's lower slopes. There are sixteen satellite shrines built as two-story Newar towers all around the sanctuary. Notably, the main structure's roofs are covered in gilt copper sheets and supported by wooden struts with carvings of many gods. The temple is accessed by four portals—one on each side—each of which has a true door and two false doors. With carved wooden colonnettes, toranas over the main doorways, and pointed blocks (bhailahkva) flanking the lower door jambs, each is elaborately articulated."

The Mustang Thakali Thali was packed with authentic Himalayan flavors — wholesome, hearty, and beautifully balanced. The Kanchampa was soft and nutty, and the Mustang Aloo had that perfect kick of spice and smokiness.\n\nThe surprise star? Their fresh watermelon juice — chilled, naturally sweet, and super refreshing. A perfect match for the meal!\n\nIf you’re craving a true taste of the hills in the city, this place delivers it with warmth and simplicity.\n\n#tastetrails #tastetrailsbyrst #foodywithrst #mustangthakali #stateIII #mustangkhana\n#mustangthakalibystateIII #goodfood&vibe"

I couldn't get enough of their Chicken Chilly; it's a must-try for anyone visiting.

Walking around feels like stepping into the past, with old temples, detailed carvings, and historic buildings all around. It’s a mix of beautiful architecture, religion, and local life.\n\nThe square is full of energy, with locals, tourists, and pigeons all sharing the space.\n\nSome areas are still under repair from the 2015 earthquake, but the square’s charm and importance are still strong. There’s a ticket fee for foreigners, so be ready for that. A must-visit place to experience the spirit of old Kathmandu."

Photos could not capture the feeling of walking through and seeing them in real. There are lots of little cultural things happening that make you feel like you have a front-row seat to Nepalese tradition. There is also an outdoor area with rows of stalls where you can buy souvenirs. Keep in mind the main museum closes early (5pm) so it's better to visit during the day. So far this is the one place I wouldn't mind revisiting on my Kathmandu trip."

Walking through this UNESCO site, you truly feel transported back in time. The rain added a unique, mystical charm, making it an even more memorable experience.

              "reviewText": "Kathmandu Durbar Square, also known as Basantapur Durbar Square, is a place where the soul of old Kathmandu still lingers. Located in the heart of the city, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a vibrant reminder of Nepal’s rich royal past. As you wander through the narrow, lively alleys that lead to the square, you’re instantly transported to a different era—one of kings, courtiers, rituals, and artistic brilliance.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you is the stunning architecture. The square is a collection of temples, shrines, courtyards, and palaces—each unique, yet harmoniously woven together. Most of these monuments date back to the Malla period, when Kathmandu’s art and architecture flourished. At the heart of it all lies the Hanuman Dhoka Palace, once home to the kings of Kathmandu. Though much of it now functions as a museum, its historic character and the stories it holds are very much alive. Walking through its courtyards, hearing your footsteps echo on the stone floors, you can almost imagine the royal processions and festivals that once took place here.\n\nOne of the most fascinating attractions is the Kumari Ghar—the residence of the Living Goddess, Kumari. This tradition, where a young girl is worshipped as the embodiment of divine power, is unique to Nepal. If you're fortunate, you may get a glimpse of the Kumari as she appears briefly at a window to bless visitors. Her presence adds an element of living spirituality to the square that few places in the world can match.\n\nAnother highlight is the Taleju Temple, the tallest structure in the square. Although only Hindus may enter, its towering presence is awe-inspiring. Nearby stands the massive statue of Kal Bhairav, a fierce manifestation of Lord Shiva. Even today, devotees come to pray here, showing that the square is not just a historical attraction but a spiritual center for locals.\n\nThough the 2015 earthquake damaged several temples, restoration efforts have been impressive. Craftsmen are using traditional methods and materials to rebuild the temples as authentically as possible. This dedication to preservation adds even more depth to the experience—you’re witnessing a culture that not only values its history but actively works to protect and revive it.\n\nWhat makes Kathmandu Durbar Square truly special is the way it blends the past with the present. The temples and palaces may be centuries old, but the square is alive. Children chase pigeons across the stones, elders rest on temple steps, and vendors sell incense, jewelry, and snacks. It’s not a museum behind glass—it’s a space where life still unfolds, just as it has for generations.\n\nWhether you're a history buff, a photographer, a culture lover, or just a curious traveler, Kathmandu Durbar Square has something to offer. It’s more than a tourist site—it’s the living heart of old Kathmandu. Take your time here, let the square unfold its stories, and you’ll leave with a deeper appreciation for the soul of Nepal."

All Monks are very nice and welcoming (the opposite is almost impossible when it comes to Monks anyway!). You quickly feel at home at the Monastery. The peacefulness and the view of the city and mountains make it even more special. The Monastery also has a restaurant/coffee shop, a convenience store, and a library you can go to during your breaks.\n\nI never thought I'd sleep well in a dormitory but I did, and I think it actually makes the experience better to be with other people in your room in this case. I've met people from all around the world, and everyone has their own special reason as to why they are attending the course.\n\n*ADVICE*: The food is very tasty and you can eat as much as you want. But a lot of us were sick (from above or from down there, if you get what I mean) while we were over there. I'm not sure why; it's tough to pinpoint one thing, but my guess is that, even though they provide us as much filtered water as we want to drink, they may be using tap water to cook. Again, I'm not sure. Also, there was barely any protein in any meal we ate the whole time (mainly carbs (bread, noodles, potatoes) and veggies), so your body lacks the energy to fight whatever foreign bacteria you're trying to digest. So my tip would be: bring some medicine for this just in case and bring something with protein to eat on the side. There is a doctor on-site but he might not have all the medicine you need or want. But don't let this discourage you from going if you can; just be well-prepared. This is still a wonderful experience."

Tucked away in this peaceful, historic town, the temple feels like stepping into a different time. It’s dedicated to Bagh Bhairab — a fierce form of Lord Shiva in the shape of a tiger — and is deeply respected by the local Newar community.\n\nThe temple’s architecture is beautiful. With its three-tiered pagoda roof, intricate wood carvings, and quiet courtyard, it gives off a calm, spiritual vibe. But what really struck me was the history behind it.\n\nDuring Nepal’s unification campaign, around 1768 AD, Kirtipur put up a strong resistance against King Prithvi Narayan Shah. The temple still displays weapons captured from the Gorkha soldiers after that battle — it’s amazing to think these walls witnessed that chapter of history.\n\nAnother unique tradition here is the clay idol of Bagh Bhairab, which is remade every 15–25 years using sacred soil from seven holy places. That level of devotion is rare and really shows the depth of local faith.\n\nIf you visit in August, don’t miss the Bagh Bhairab Jatra. Locals walk around the temple 108 times, believing it brings good health and success. The energy and devotion during the festival is truly inspiring.\n\nThis temple isn’t just a religious site — it’s a living part of Kirtipur’s identity. Whether you’re spiritual, curious about history, or just love authentic places, Bagh Bhairab Temple is absolutely worth a visit."

It is one of the 51 Shakti Peethas, believed to be where parts of Goddess Sati’s body fell. The temple is known for its unique pagoda-style architecture and a silver-plated sacred symbol inside instead of a statue. Located near Pashupatinath Temple by the Bagmati River, it is a peaceful place for worship, especially during festivals like Dashain and Navaratri. Only Hindus can enter the temple, and it is a key site for Tantric rituals performed by local priests. Visiting early in the morning offers a calm, spiritual atmosphere. Guhyeshwari Temple is a beautiful and important spot to experience Nepal’s rich religious culture and devotion to the goddess."

              "reviewText": "A Serene Sanctuary in the Heart of Nepal\nNestled on the banks of the Bagmati River, near the revered Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu, lies the ancient and sacred Guhyeshwari Shaktipeeth. This significant Hindu temple is dedicated to Guhyeshwari, a manifestation of Adi Shakti, and is one of the most important Shaktipeeths, sites where body parts of Sati Devi are believed to have fallen. The very name \"Guhyeshwari\" translates to \"Guhya\" (secret) and \"Ishwari\" (goddess), signifying the hidden or secret deity, a testament to its profound spiritual significance.Upon entering the temple complex, a palpable sense of tranquility envelops you. Unlike many bustling pilgrimage sites, Guhyeshwari offers a more introspective and peaceful experience. The main shrine, a multi-tiered pagoda-style structure adorned with intricate carvings, houses a kalasha (water urn) representing the goddess, rather than a traditional idol. This unique representation adds to the mystique and draws devotees into a deeper contemplation of the divine feminine energy.Pilgrims often perform rituals and offer prayers, seeking blessings for prosperity, health, and spiritual enlightenment. The continuous chanting of mantras by priests creates an ethereal atmosphere, further enhancing the devotional experience. The temple's location by the Bagmati River, considered holy by Hindus, adds to its sanctity, and many devotees take a dip in its waters before offering prayers.\nWhile not as grand in scale as some other prominent temples, Guhyeshwari Shaktipeeth's charm lies in its spiritual potency and serene ambiance. It offers a unique glimpse into the rich tapestry of Nepalese Hindu traditions and provides a sacred space for quiet contemplation and unwavering devotion. For anyone visiting Kathmandu, a pilgrimage to Guhyeshwari Shaktipeeth is not just a religious journey but an enriching cultural and spiritual experience that leaves a lasting impression."

Located very close to the famous Pashupatinath Temple on the banks of the Bagmati River, it is dedicated to Goddess Parvati. The temple has deep spiritual energy, and the atmosphere is calm, filled with the sound of bells and mantras.\n\nThe architecture is traditional Nepali style with a golden roof and sacred interiors. Unlike the busy Pashupatinath, this temple feels more peaceful and meditative, making it perfect for quiet prayer and reflection. Priests are kind and can guide you through rituals and pujas if you wish to perform them.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is the presence of monkeys around the temple. They can sometimes snatch food, water bottles, or other belongings, so be careful and keep your things secure.\n\nOverall, visiting Guhyeshwari Temple is a divine experience, especially for those interested in spirituality and Hindu culture. Highly recommended as part of your Kathmandu trip. 🙏✨"

What stands out immediately is the large, fierce-looking mask of Akash Bhairav displayed on the second floor of the building—it’s bold, detailed, and quite captivating.\n\nThis temple holds deep spiritual importance for both Hindus and Buddhists. Locals often stop by to offer prayers, and it’s especially lively during festivals like Indra Jatra, when the mask is fully uncovered and rituals take place with a lot of energy and devotion. On regular days, you can still catch people lighting oil lamps and offering flowers.\n\nIt’s not a large temple, but its cultural and religious significance is huge. It’s also very accessible if you’re walking through the old city. Definitely worth a quick stop if you're nearby—it gives a deeper glimpse into Kathmandu’s living traditions and how strongly the old gods are still part of daily life."

This three-storied temple is longitudinal in plan with its front façade facing to the East. Akash Bhairav  'Lord of the sky' is one of the popular Bhairav of Kathmandu Valley.He is also known as 1st King of Kirat, Yalambar in Nepal, as Barbarika in Mahabharata and Āaju meaning First King in Nepal Bhasa and Shyam Baba in Rajasthan. This temple is located merely 10 minutes away from Kathmandu Durbar Square. In the religious and cultural aspect, Akash Bhairav is also known as the god of rain by the farmers. As Nepal is heavily dependent on agriculture therefore farmers ask  Ahash Bhairav’s blessing in the true form of prayer. Indra Jatra, an annual 8-day festival devoted to the god, is also celebrated with great enthusiasm. Followers from all over the world come to Kathmandu to be a part of the important pooja rituals performed during this time of the year."

Although he is thought to be an appearance of Lord Shiva, like Banasura, he may also have been a disciple of the latter. In Nepali tradition, the account of Aakash Bhairav's involvement in the Kurukshetra War has numerous further additions. Hindu deity Akash Bhairav, known as the \"god of the sky,\" is honored in a number of large temples in Kathmandu. He is also regarded as the ancestor of the Maharjan caste, particularly the peasant groups. The figure atop Aakash Bhairav's head is one that both Buddhists and Hindus recognize as Buddha, making the idol of Yalamber/Barbarika/Aakash Bhairav one that is revered by everybody. In Kathmandu, the head of the Aakash Bhairav was discovered several centuries ago. The head is currently housed in a nearby Hindu temple in Kathmandu, not too distant from Durbar Square. Once a year, it is brought out of the temple and blessed by the Kumari, a living goddess who resides close by at Kumari Chowk. The Bhairav is typically worshipped as a symbol of strength and protection. The temple contains a decked temple and the god for eight continuous days during the ceremonies of the Indrajatra festival."

There are a variety of birds. During my visit a year ago, I had the chance to see a fox, which ran away in a flash. This time, I went with my daughter; unfortunately, she was disappointed as there was no fox in sight.

This place is well managed by the baudha samaj and thank you for them too. There are benches for sitting so if you are feel tied while doing kora ( round) then there is a great place to have a rest. Overall everything is ok but toilet is quiet dirty so please if you go there don’t throw waste over there and if you can’t clean then don’t make it dirty too. Organization who are responsible for that please have a look. At last everything is ok except toilet but you can manage it.

Ltd.\nReviewed 1 week ago\n\nA WALK ON THE WILD SIDE\n\nThis was our 2nd incredible trip to this region organised by Kedar, of Actual Adventure Pvt Ltd. It was as faultless as the first, when we had trekked to Annapurna Base Camp. This time, 11 years later, we returned to visit Bhutan & Tibet & were lucky enough to re-visit Pokhara & stay at Chitwan National Wild Life Park, as well as having some chill time in Kathmandu, in the sumptuous Ramada Hotel complete with rooftop pool & bar.\n\nThis was a busy, exciting, even challenging holiday full of unique experiences - trekking to the Tiger's Nest in beautiful Bhutan, that special country, arriving at Everest Base Camp to be at the foot of the Mother Goddess, & catching our first sight of Potala Palace in Llasa, Tibet. These were unforgettable experiences which will stay with us - as will the sight of rhinos in the wild.\n\nWe were in the careful hands of our guides, Pema & Phuntso & Kedar from Actual Adventure made sure that this demanding trip was a smooth one with our needs & comfort cared for including changing arrangements, hotels, even destinations.\n\nI can thoroughly recommend Actual Adventure for all your holiday plans, group, solo, or bespoke. Nothing is too much trouble !\n\nDate of experience: October 2024\nThis review is the subjective opinion of a Tripadvisor member and not of Tripadvisor LLC.

From the moment we booked our trip, the professionalism and dedication of the company were evident, making the entire experience seamless and enjoyable.\n\nGuidance and Expertise:\n\nOur guide, Ganesh Acharya, was exceptional. His extensive knowledge of the Annapurna region, coupled with his friendly and approachable demeanor, made the trek both educational and enjoyable. Ganesh was incredibly attentive to our needs, always ensuring our safety and comfort. His ability to navigate the challenging terrain and provide insightful information about the local culture, flora, and fauna significantly enriched our journey.\n\nTrek Experience:\n\nThe trek itself was breathtaking. Starting from the lush green forests to the majestic views of the Annapurna massif, every day brought new and stunning landscapes. The itinerary was well-paced, allowing ample time for acclimatization and rest. The teahouses we stayed in were comfortable and welcoming, providing a perfect respite after long days of trekking.\n\nHighlights:\n\nThe hospitality of the local people added a personal touch to our adventure, making us feel at home in this remote part of the world.\nReaching Annapurna Base Camp and standing amidst the towering peaks was an indescribable experience that left us in awe of nature’s grandeur.\n\nThank you, Ganesh, Kedar, and the entire Actual Adventure team, for an incredible Annapurna Base Camp trek. You exceeded all our expectations and created memories that will last a lifetime."
