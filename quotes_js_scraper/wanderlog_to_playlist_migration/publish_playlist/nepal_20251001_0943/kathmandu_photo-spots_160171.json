The square is amazing, we went to 2 places and got blessed by the monks. Then we did 3 rounds of the Stupa, turning the prayer wheels.\nTruly calming and peaceful place. There are various shops, and the best is that you can look around without being hasseled to buy. I went twice, be sure to take a guide with you. The history is super amazing. It's a square filled with delicious restaurants. Also the alleys are worth exploring, always leads to some serious coffee shops.",

The air is always filled with the gentle hum of prayers, the scent of incense, and a sense of shared tranquility.\n\nAdding to its appeal are the close-by shops and cafes that offer absolutely great food. Whether you're looking for a quick bite or a relaxing meal, there are plenty of delicious options to choose from, making it an ideal place to spend an afternoon or evening.\n\nUltimately, Boudhanath Stupa is a place where you can truly find yourself calm. It's a sacred space that invites introspection and offers a much-needed escape from the hustle and bustle, while also serving as a vibrant community hub.

            "text": "Narayanhiti Palace Palace is a must-visit for anyone traveling to Kathmandu and interested in Nepal's rich history. Once the royal palace of the Shah dynasty, it was turned into a public museum after the monarchy ended in 2008. The complex is well-preserved, giving a real glimpse into royal life. Inside, the lavish halls, elegant throne room, and preserved artifacts showcase the luxury and power of Nepal's former kings.\n\nThe audio guide (available for a small extra fee) is very informative and well worth it. Photography is not allowed inside, which can be disappointing for some, but it helps maintain the palace's sanctity and historical value. The grounds outside are clean and peaceful with beautiful gardens and fountains - a great place to stroll and take pictures.\n\nLocated in the heart of Kathmandu, it's easy to reach by taxi or even on foot from Thamel. Entry fees are affordable for Nepali visitors, though a bit higher for foreigners. Plan at least 1-2 hours to explore properly. Overall, Narayanhiti Palace Museum is a fascinating stop for travelers looking to understand Nepal's royal heritage and political transformation.",

The museum beautifully showcases the legacy of Nepal's monarchy, offering a rare and intimate look into the royal lifestyle.\n\nFrom royal reception halls to the King's private chambers, every room tells a story. What truly struck me was the solemn atmosphere around the tragic Royal Massacre site-preserved exactly as it was. It felt surreal and emotional.\n\nI've also shared some photos, opening hours, and ticket fees info to help fellow travelers plan better.\n\nHighlights:\n•\tIntricate architecture & vintage interiors\n•\tDetailed exhibits about the monarchy\n•\tWell-maintained and peaceful\n•\tGreat place for history lovers and curious explorers\n\nHighly recommend setting aside at least 1.5 to 2 hours for the full experience. This place is not just a museum-it's a journey through Nepal's modern history.",

It's a place where you don't just see culture, you feel it.\n\nThe intricate woodwork, ancient courtyards, and spiritual energy make it a must-visit for anyone who loves history, photography, or just wants a break from the modern chaos.\n\nSharing some snapshots I took-they barely do justice, but I hope they inspire someone else to explore this gem.

It's a beautifully maintained garden with lush greenery, charming fountains, and enough tranquility to make you forget you're in the middle of a vibrant city. Seriously, it's like stepping into a different world where the sound of traffic is replaced by the gentle rustling of leaves.\n\nYes, you do have to pay an entrance fee, but trust me, it's totally worth it. For what you get – a serene escape, clean spaces, and a well-maintained garden – it's a small price to pay. Plus, the extra fee is totally justified by the delightful experience of being able to kick back and enjoy the surroundings without the usual Kathmandu chaos.\n\nThe garden also has a café where you can grab a drink or bite to eat. Now, fair warning, it's on the pricier side (for Kathmandu standards), but I guess you're paying for the peaceful vibes and the fact that you're sitting in the only place that feels this calm and relaxed in the city. Still, it's a lovely spot to sip on something cool or enjoy a snack.\n\nFor those looking for a productive escape, this could be the perfect place to study or read a book – it's quiet enough to concentrate, and the surrounding beauty might just inspire you. It's a good spot for both relaxing and getting some serious work done.\n\nAll in all, a hidden gem in Kathmandu that's definitely worth checking out!",

Walking through the complex, you can really feel the history, especially with the old wooden carvings and statues. It's a great spot to learn about Nepal's royal past while exploring the lively Durbar Square.\n\nI visited Hanuman Dhoka and was really impressed with how well-preserved it is considering its age. The architecture is stunning, and the surrounding area is full of energy with street vendors and tourists. It's easy to spend a couple of hours here wandering around and soaking in the history of the place.\n\nIf you're into photography or just love history, Hanuman Dhoka is a fantastic spot. The palace is beautiful, and you can learn a lot about Nepal's kings and the country's past. It's also located right in the middle of Durbar Square, so there's plenty to do around it.

All Monks are very nice and welcoming (the opposite is almost impossible when it comes to Monks anyway!). You quickly feel at home at the Monastery. The peacefulness and the view of the city and mountains make it even more special. The Monastery also has a restaurant/coffee shop, a convenience store, and a library you can go to during your breaks.\n\nI never thought I'd sleep well in a dormitory but I did, and I think it actually makes the experience better to be with other people in your room in this case. I've met people from all around the world, and everyone has their own special reason as to why they are attending the course.\n\n*ADVICE*: The food is very tasty and you can eat as much as you want. But a lot of us were sick (from above or from down there, if you get what I mean) while we were over there. I'm not sure why; it's tough to pinpoint one thing, but my guess is that, even though they provide us as much filtered water as we want to drink, they may be using tap water to cook. Again, I'm not sure. Also, there was barely any protein in any meal we ate the whole time (mainly carbs (bread, noodles, potatoes) and veggies), so your body lacks the energy to fight whatever foreign bacteria you're trying to digest. So my tip would be: bring some medicine for this just in case and bring something with protein to eat on the side. There is a doctor on-site but he might not have all the medicine you need or want. But don't let this discourage you from going if you can; just be well-prepared. This is still a wonderful experience.",
