I think more than ten play spots are available exclusively for children.\n\nI appreciate the meticulously planned vast green grass spaces with chairs for elderly people. Looking at those tall and bulky trees I feel small and humble.\n\nThere is a small structure erected in memory of war veterans inside the park. It lists the names of those soldiers during two different periods. A one page write up with precise details may help tourists like me to understand the importance of this memorial.\n\nThere is a cafeteria and also WC. It is a must to visit this park for those with small kids, children or adults or elderly. Once again, I appreciate the Basel Municipality for maintaining such an amazing park",

Chef Tanja Grandits's innovative approach to cuisine shines through in every bite, showcasing a harmonious blend of textures and tastes.\n\nThe service was impeccable, with a knowledgeable and attentive staff who guided me through the menu with expertise and warmth. The attention to detail and genuine passion for hospitality were evident throughout the entire meal, making me feel truly valued as a guest.\nThe ambiance of the restaurant was equally impressive, with a refined yet welcoming atmosphere.\n\nIt is a true gem in Basel's culinary scene, and I cannot recommend it highly enough for anyone seeking an extraordinary dining experience. I left Stucki feeling not only satisfied but also inspired by the culinary artistry and hospitality displayed by Chef Tanja and her team.",

First of all the good points.\n-if you ask questions they are dutifully answered and even though they tried to accommodate your requests as good as possible.\n-the food was mostly very very good. A few dishes were not fitting into the concept somehow but overall superb quality of cooking\n-when mentioned we had some books to sign we were even shown the patisserie.\n-the armosphere was amazing.\n\nThe things which didn't go so well:\n-the wine pairing was completely out of synch with dinner. They poured the next wine before we even finished the last one.\n-the amouse bouche was somehow in a weird order and the one we tried first was overwhelming every taste.\n-the first starter was absolutely not fitting.\n-the apero was extraordinary expensive. This is something which bothers me generally. They never tell you how much an apero will cost even though it is important and 35 per glass is outrageous if you only get it on the bill.\n-we paid 1200 chf for two people and for that it wasn't good enough to be honest. Most expensive star experience so far and i think other ones were much better.",

It is located on Spalengraben and Schonbein Strasse.\n\nThere are two fossilised tree trunks imported from the USA. These trees lived 210 million years ago in the desert area of Arizona, USA.\n\nThough the garden space is small compared to others, the space has been very well utilised. There are many green houses worth exploring. However, these green houses close an hour earlier than the visiting hours.\n\nThe garden is almost part of the university. For example, the environmental sciences department has a doorway to this garden.\n\nI really wondered how could they grow trees in wooden boxes. The trees are short but bear big fruits like lemon, apple and pomegranate. The visit was enjoyable and informative. All the students must visit and learn how great nature is.",

If you want to visit, it is recommended to go around 10:00 in the morning and reserve two hours of sightseeing time, or wait until the afternoon when the sun is not so strong.

From the  greeting as we arrived a bit early to the flawless dining experience and finally, the unexpected, super enjoyable after dinner drinks and cigar bar, this dining experience was unrivaled.\nOur group of 4 came to Basel for one night and were fortunate enough to score a lunch reservation Friday, May 9th. From the moment we stepped into the stunning hotel and absolutely beautiful restaurant we knew our experience would be memorable.\nAs we arrived early, we were greeted immediately and escorted to the bar area right outside the main restaurant.  It was almost as if they expected us early.  We drank some champagne before entering the main restaurant experience right on time.\nThe dining room was tastefully decorated and the subtle touches (i.e. candles) made the experience special.  The setting along the Rhine River was just one more Iconic element.   The dining room was full and at the same time entirely intimate. We knew there were other guests in the room with us, but never really felt or heard their presence.\nTo say the food was amazing is to sell it short.  When you dine at an establishment like Cheval Blanc, you expect the food to be exceptional.  The food on this day was more than up to the task.  Two of us were grateful that the chef allowed us to substitute for our main protein course. The presentation was amazing with each course seemingly looking and tasting better than the previous one.  I will post a few pictures and hope you will accept our apologies for the one course/picture that has a spoon in it.  That course looked (and was) so delicious that we all started eating before we took a picture.  The cheese course was a welcome and unique experience for us.  Note: the picture I posted was AI adjusted as we removed the photobombers (coworkers and other patrons) from the picture.  No cheese was altered by AI.\nThe wine list was extensive and impressive and our selections matched up well to our menu.\nThe Cheval Banc team was a perfect accompaniment to the food and drink.  The entire team worked with precision, knowing just when to serve the next course with compelling descriptions.  The team was personal and engaging, yet never intrusive.  Flawless in execution while at the same time graceful in delivery.\nOur chef came out at the end of our meal and engaged our table for a few minutes. He was authentically interested in learning about our experience and outwardly pleased we enjoyed our time.\n\nTo finish off the day, our group was escorted to the Cigar Bar for drinks and a smoke.  It could not have been a better setting for our nightcap (err, day cap).  The setting was reminiscent of a scene from a James Bod movie.  Yet again, we felt refreshingly alone in a room with multiple groups present and our experience only enhanced by the people serving us.\n\nOur only regret was cutting or trip to Basel short by a day.  Hopefully we will have a chance to return to the wonderful city on a future trip and be lucky enough to dine at Cheval Blanc again.  Maybe we will see you there!",

There are NO English captions/explanations throughout and if I can read German correctly very few objects were before the 19th century. Besides the very cool ceremonial house, the building exterior is the best thing. I didn't see how the arrangement on each floor made sense… but then again not a German speaker!",

            "text": "Right on the Rhine River this is my favorite French restaurant in Basel. It is definitely formal and a bit expensive but not expensive compared to restaurants in other larger cities like NYC or Paris or Michelin starred prefix menus. I feel that it is totally worth it especially if you're a tourist and really want to soak in some of the best sites of the city. The restaurant has a very romantic vibe so it would be great for a date, dinner with friends or family, or something more social versus a business location. Our server was extremely polite and all around there was top-notch five star service. Everything that we ordered came out pretty fast and to say that they were very attentive would be an understatement.\n\nI started off my meal with a really nice glass of Bordeaux and it really got my hunger going for what was ahead. For my starter I chose the Saumon Marine which is basically a Salmon Crudo and I thought it was great. It was light and refreshing and woke up my taste buds for my entrée, which was the Sole Meunière. I've had this dish many times in my life at many different locations and this was one of the better ones I've had in a long time. It was made perfectly and the flavors lasted throughout the rest of the night. I would highly recommend ordering it and I also would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone. It was one of our more memorable moments of our time in Basel.",
