The journey up, via a series of gondolas, builds anticipation with every stop, and once you reach the top, the panoramic views are absolutely breathtaking. Standing at over 12,700 feet, with snow-covered peaks stretching across Switzerland, France, and Italy, it truly feels like you're on top of the world.\n\nOne of the most unique features is the Ice Palace, an ethereal experience where you walk inside a glacier. The cool, quiet tunnels carved into the ice are unlike anything I've seen before, with sculptures and shimmering walls that make the whole experience feel dreamlike.\n\nThe combination of the Ice Palace, the observation deck, and the surreal stillness at that altitude created a moment of awe I wasn't expecting. It's more than just a viewpoint; it's a space that invites you to pause, breathe deeply, and feel small in the best possible way. Despite the high elevation, the facilities were incredibly well maintained, and everything felt thoughtfully designed for visitors.\n\nFor anyone visiting Zermatt, this isn't just a scenic stop, it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience that stays with you long after you descend.",

The location is absolutely magical, with the most breathtaking views of the Matterhorn. We went to celebrate my mom's 70th birthday, and the staff went above and beyond to make it special. They were so kind and accommodating-letting our group of four sit at the very front of the patio (a spot that usually only seats two). At the end of lunch, they even surprised my mom with a birthday dessert, which was such a thoughtful gesture and made her day unforgettable. I am so grateful to them for creating such a wonderful memory.\n\nThe food was excellent-the salads were fresh, flavorful, and filling, and the cocktails were delicious and refreshing after the hike down. Everything was beautifully presented and tasted just as good as the views looked!\n\nThe hike itself was very manageable on the way down, but if you're going with seniors, I'd recommend bringing hiking sticks, as the trek back up can be a bit tough. We had an 11:30 reservation, so the hike down was comfortable, but heading back up later in the day got hot-definitely bring sunscreen.\n\nBetween the views, the food, and the warm, thoughtful service, Chez Vrony is absolutely worth the effort to get there. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone visiting Zermatt-it's an experience you'll never forget.",

If I could have only done one it would definitely have been this one.\n\nAt 3,883 m, this is the highest you can get in Europe by cable car - higher than even Jungfraujoch. The journey itself has some nice views as you go up and down from station to station. As you near the top, passing over an astonishing glacier, the air gets thin and I noticed myself getting tired just walking up a slope! But it is so worth it.\n\nWalk down a few steps and you can step out on to the Breithornplateau, 3.8 km high, and walk on snow and ice, even in the middle of August. And of course enjoy the view of the Matterhorn, but also nearby Breithorn, which you can climb if you're feeling fit. On a clear day like when I visited, you can even see Mount Blanc 70 km away on the horizon.\n\nYou can even walk across the snowy plateau to Italy if you like. There is a real sense of the icy expanse.\n\nAs a bonus the ice caves within the glacier are a really neat experience. The ice sculptures are cool (literally) and you really get a sense of wonder at the sheer amount of ice all around you, slowly sliding down the mountain.\n\nDefinitely worth it.",

Doing this downhill it's not only easier but offers the better views.  Highly recommended.  This is doable with children that are probably 8 or above as the terrain requires decent amount of concentration to avoid slipping.",

On the route you can also see places where glaciers were present in the past, but also see the impact of the greenhouse effect on the earth. The route is not technically difficult. There are a few fairly steep climbs with minor ascents. The route can be covered in 2h45min without hurrying.",
