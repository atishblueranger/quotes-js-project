The exterior of the cathedral is impressive with its ornate painted portal, belfry, and vibrant rose window.

You'll also get some great views of Lausanne from the front. If you want even better views you can pay a small fee and climb the bell-tower. This gives you 360 degree views of the city. Absolutely epic on a clear day. It's not for the faint-hearted or those with vertigo. Also not for those with major mobility problems.

Please visit the grounds even if you do not step inside the museum.  Nice views over the lake and pleasant outdoor Olympic related art and information sprinkled through the outdoor grounds and all of this is free to access. Inside it is a well curated place with lots of information for an Olympics fan. We did it all in about 2 hours. The gift shop is where you buy the entrance tickets.\n\nPro tip: if you do have a ticket and are there during the daytime, you do NOT need a lunch reservation to simply have a drink on their glorious outdoor terrace at the restaurant on the top floor. We just asked the host if we could sit outside for a drink and he enthusiastically said of course! What views!!! Drinks were not cheap but not more expensive than any other restaurant. So if you are curious and didn't make a lunch reservation, please do stop by and see if you can snag a seat outside. The staff were kind and helpful.",

The dry aged steak was amazing. Cooked rare and very buttery tasting. We would recommend the panna cotta desert. It's a star. Fantastic service. We will return.",

The staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming, and I would especially like to commend Mathew from the concierge team for his outstanding service - his professionalism and attentiveness truly enhanced our visit.\n\nThe breakfast, though modest in size, was absolutely spectacular. The quality of the food, the cozy atmosphere, and the genuinely caring staff made each morning a delight.\n\nThe hotel's location is superb, offering easy access to the best of Lausanne. The only shortcoming was the room's plumbing and electrical infrastructure, which showed signs of the building's age. However, this did not detract significantly from the overall experience, thanks to the warmth and excellence of the team.\n\nThank you for a memorable stay - I look forward to returning.",

Flowing with charm and personality, and full of people enjoying themselves. We had a wonderful farm to table salad, the best cheese fondue ever, and a side of hashbrowns that were to die for (the side of hashbrowns is not on the menu, but they will do it).  The wines were surprisingly good. I had the Merlot Ticino and my wife had a glass, actually several glasses, of Prosecco.  A real hidden gem!",

No cold cuts, no potatoes, nothing. Just bread and cheese. Maybe that's normal for Switzerland, but we were expecting more.\n\nSecondly, the fondue was extremely bitter - we guess too much wine was used. We left half of it uneaten because we simply didn't enjoy it.\n\nThe place itself is nice, and the staff is friendly. But the fondue is a 1/10. I can't recommend it.",

It feels both elegant and relaxed at the same time.\n\nWe ordered a mix of seasonal dishes and everything was spot on. The Vol-au-Vent with wild mushrooms was rich and comforting, the local fish dishes (filet de féra and truite) were delicate and perfectly cooked, the seasonal salads with chanterelles, burrata, and fresh tomatoes tasted like summer on a plate, the shawarma was full of flavor, and the steak with béarnaise sauce was perfectly done with vegetables and the most delicious roasted potatoes. The balance between freshness, local ingredients, and indulgence is exactly what you want from a brasserie of this level.\n\nService was excellent, attentive, warm, and perfectly timed without ever feeling rushed.\n\nWhether you come for a long lunch on the terrace or a dinner with friends, this place captures the best of Lausanne with beautiful views, local produce, and a lively atmosphere. Highly recommended.\n\nBig thanks to Casandra & Mathew",

The location is stunning-perched above Grandvaux with sweeping views of Lake Geneva and surrounding vineyards. It's an easy walk from the Grandvaux train station and sits perfectly along the vineyard trail.\n\nWe enjoyed a relaxing tasting on the outdoor terrace, sampling their local Chasselas and rosé wines. The host was friendly and took time to explain each variety, even with the language barrier. The vineyard itself is peaceful and scenic-perfect for unwinding after a vineyard stroll.\n\nHighly recommend stopping here for wine tasting if you're exploring Lavaux. Great wines, beautiful view, and a very local experience.\n\n🕒 Tip: Best to come mid-morning or around lunch hour for a quieter tasting experience.",

Showed up and there was a group of 20+ people in a wine tasting and food tasting experience who had complete preference over us. No problem great for them. We were placed in the corner and clearly secondary to them.  We were told they ran out of the cheese for our tasting (probably because of the big party) so we switched to just a wine tasting. Then waited 27 minutes for our tasting in which we walked inside for our wine and told they would come find us. After being served all our wines at once we were charged 52 CHF FOR 4 small pairings each. I am so saddened to leave this review but damn I am so disappointed .

There was even an exhibition book at the entrance which provided insights on the pieces. I went in on a weekday and there was only a handful of people so it pretty much felt like I had the museum to myself!\n\nIt's definitely worth checking out this lovely museum.
