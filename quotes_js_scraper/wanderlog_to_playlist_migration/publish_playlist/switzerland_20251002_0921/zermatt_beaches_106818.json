The scenery along the path is beautiful, lots of wildlife and small animals. The views on the nearby mountains are spectacular especially the  Matterhorn looks stunning in the morning light. There are two ways to the Oberrothhorn. Personally I took the way over the ridge to the Unterrothhorn and from there You hike a bit down and start hiking to the Oberrothhorn. There is also a path around the Unterrothhorn wich is easier but a kilometer longer approximately. The hike on the Oberrothhorn is easy and doesn't get hard in anyway, there is one point with a rope but you don't really need it. The views on the top are spectacular. You are able to see all the mountains surrounding you in a spectacular fashion. On the way down I choose to go to Zermatt and take the train from there to Täsch. The hike was 35km long and the elevation gain was 2000m. It took me a full day of walking. I would recommend to get an early start to beat the heat lower on the mountain.",

Located on the 3415m altitude it offers breathtaking 360 panorama on the surrounding snow capped peaks and glaciers.\n\nYou can climb here from Rothorn (around 400m elevation gain) or Blauherd (slightly under 900m). The climb is easy, it has low gradient all the time, so you can easily keep your pace.\n\nDon't try it on your first day in Zermatt though, you need some acclimatization before climbing to that altitude.",
