You'll also get some great views of Lausanne from the front. If you want even better views you can pay a small fee and climb the bell-tower. This gives you 360 degree views of the city. Absolutely epic on a clear day. It's not for the faint-hearted or those with vertigo. Also not for those with major mobility problems. I use a walking stick due to bone spurs in my ankle and I made it OK. Just had to take it a bit slower.",

Please visit the grounds even if you do not step inside the museum.  Nice views over the lake and pleasant outdoor Olympic related art and information sprinkled through the outdoor grounds and all of this is free to access. Inside it is a well curated place with lots of information for an Olympics fan. We did it all in about 2 hours. The gift shop is where you buy the entrance tickets.\n\nPro tip: if you do have a ticket and are there during the daytime, you do NOT need a lunch reservation to simply have a drink on their glorious outdoor terrace at the restaurant on the top floor. We just asked the host if we could sit outside for a drink and he enthusiastically said of course! What views!!! Drinks were not cheap but not more expensive than any other restaurant. So if you are curious and didn't make a lunch reservation, please do stop by and see if you can snag a seat outside. The staff were kind and helpful.",

Access and exit are via a metal gate being activated by pressing a button, something not really evident to many of the visitors. In the warm season access is possible all day till 6 p.m. There is a fantastic view over Lausanne, its suburbs and the surrounding countryside, better than photos taken in the middle of the day with its flat light.",

There is plenty of space on the walls to add English or at least German. I usually help myself with a translator, but it does not work in the basement floor due to absence of mobile signal. There is a WiFi, but for password you have to go back to the cash desk, so my suggestion is to connect to WiFi when you buy tickets.\n\nThe shop is usually full of great books relevant to the exhibitions, again English or German versions are very rare.\n\nStaff is super friendly. There are views from the villa to the lake, in one room you may sit and play chess. Same as there is a place where you can sit down with your children.\n\nThe exhibition space is large, do not underestimate time for basement level, it is the biggest :).",

On regular days, the museum closes at 6 PM, which isn't ideal for people who work during the day.\nHowever, on other days (except Thursday), the entrance fee is 22 CHF, which I find too expensive – especially compared to other art galleries in Switzerland.\nThe restaurant next to the museum is also quite overpriced.",

Their histories told beside their art works is often touching, sometimes violent. The French artist Jean Dubuffet was the initiator of this museum being a collector of this art form himself and then donating his collection to Lausanne. Just now, early 2024, the museum features a special exhibition called Visages, \"faces\", from which I have chosen to present some photographs for the reader to enjoy.  The museum is discretely implanted facing the Lausanne congress center, somewhat off the center of town, and is surprisingly roomy. The works are beautifully curated.
