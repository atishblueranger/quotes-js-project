Its red sandstone walls, colorful roof tiles, and twin towers make it an iconic landmark in Basel. The cathedral's construction spanned several centuries and features a mix of Romantic and Gothic styles. Destroyed in an earthquake in 1356, the impressive structure was rebuilt and converted into a Reformed Protestant Church.",

The former episcopal church – Basel Minster – was built between the years 1019 and 1500 in the Romantic and Gothic styles. The crypt, the chancel, the tomb of Erasmus of Rotterdam, the Gallus gate and the two cloisters are witness to a fascinating tale of construction over a period of several centuries.",

I would say this is my favorite museum that I went to while visiting this beautiful city and would highly recommend to any museum or art fan to do the same. They have tons of classic works by world famous artists as well as artists that I've never heard of. The works spans many countries and many generations and it's a huge wealth of knowledge and beauty to see in one visit. It would be easy to spend over four hours here but we spent about 2 1/2 hours really soaking in everything. It's three main floors divided into different time periods and art styles and on the bottom floor they have a really nice café where we enjoyed some lattes before heading out into the rain. Pricing is fair and the building is large and beautiful. No bags or umbrellas are allowed, but they have lockers right at the front entrance for free for you to place your valuables. They are also really lenient about photography just as long as you don't use flash. The entire staff was very polite and I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Basel to check this place out.",

As an active art lover and collector, I have not spent too much time in this museum before unfortunately, as I had only been there for events during Art Basel week. Finally I had the chance to come back to Basel and dedicate some time for a thorough visit and viewing last week, and it was for nearly 6 hours, and every moment was well spent.\n\nThe museums have two buildings connected by an underground tunnel, with vast permanent collections from Renaissance & Early Modern (15th-16th c.) with strong holdings from the Upper Rhine: Hans Holbein the Younger, the Amerbach Cabinet origins; 17th-18th Centuries, Flemish and Dutch masters (like Rubens, Rembrandt); 19th Century of Impressionism, Post-Impressionism, Symbolism. Simply impressive collections from Monet, Cézanne, Manet, Van Gogh. Swiss artists too, such as Ferdinand Hodler.\n\nThen the 20th Century including major movement coverage: Fauvism, Cubism, Expressionism, Surrealism, Constructivism with Important works from artists: Paul Klee, Pablo Picasso, Alberto Giacometti, Marc Chagall, Piet Mondrian etc. The collections from this era at this museum impressed me the most this time!\n\nThe Post Modern / contemporary collections are also worthy investigating, from Jackson Pollock, Andy Warhol, Helen Frankenthaler, Miriam Cahn, Dan Flavin, Kara Walker, Bruce Nauman, Calder and more.\n\nThere are plenty of rooms to wonder with comfortable sofas in and out the exhibition halls, so you could really take time to experience the art, and it is never too crowded with too many phone cameras or noises around. The staff are extremely friendly and helpful, very refreshing especially compared with other major museums around the world. Highly recommend it for art enthusiasts, families and it is a must visit when in Basel.",

Healthy food is only available in markets and such. Restaurants are extremely expensive and open very late.\n\nWe were there on a Friday and walked a lot just to find a Turkish restaurant. When we got there, they told us that dinner is served at 5 PM and asked us to come back then. The person also said that most places in Basel are like this.\n\nWe ended up just having a coffee and leaving. So honestly, we wandered around all day hungry. Later, we had a beef sausage at a market - we paid 8 francs for it. It tasted so bad.\n\nUnfortunately, we were really disappointed with the food, and everything was extremely expensive.",

If you want to visit, it is recommended to go around 10:00 in the morning and reserve two hours of sightseeing time, or wait until the afternoon when the sun is not so strong. If you don't understand German, try to bring a translation software to recognize some plant signs. This is a very good place to spend the weekend.",

The Tinguely Fountain is one of those spots that's both whimsical and thought-provoking-a perfect blend of art and motion right in the heart of Basel. I stumbled on it by chance and ended up staying far longer than expected, just watching the sculptures come to life. A must-see if you appreciate creativity with a playful twist.

            "text": "A Splash of Genius and Madness – Tinguely Fountain\n\nIf Salvador Dalí and Rube Goldberg had teamed up to build a fountain after a night out in Basel, this might be the result.\n\nTinguely Fountain isn't your average “stand-and-stare” kind of fountain. Nope. It's a bunch of metal creatures, built from what looks like leftover parts from an old theater backstage, dancing and splashing around like they're alive-and possibly a little tipsy.\n\nCreated by the Swiss artist Jean Tinguely in the late 1970s (clearly ahead of his time… or out of it), this kinetic fountain moves, squirts, spins, wobbles, and somehow perfectly captures the chaotic joy of creativity. Each piece has its own rhythm, like a rusty ballet with water jets.\n\nI loved how playful and unpredictable it was-like the fountain has a sense of humor. Don't expect a peaceful moment of reflection here; expect to smile, get splashed, and maybe question the laws of physics.\n\nLocated right in front of the Basel Theater, it's basically the city's most artistic water fight. A must-see if you enjoy quirky, clever art that doesn't take itself too seriously (and neither should you).\n\n💧 Pro tip: Go when it's sunny. Watching water fly through the air in golden light is magical. Just don't stand too close unless you brought a towel.",

The three branches of the museum feature exhibits from the Middle Ages. The building itself formerly functioned as a church but was looted during the Reformation and was used as a barn until the 19th century.",

It is in the center of Basel, so no matter which direction you start from, there is a very convenient transportation to bring you here. It is not large in scale, but it has a large collection of collections, and it carries a lot of information about the city's past from the source of Basel's history to today. It is a good place to kill time. If you have a Basel Tourist Card, you can also enjoy half price, about 7.5 Swiss francs.",

            "text": "A Hidden Gem Among City History Museums\n\nWhile I confess to having a soft spot for city history museums, the Basel Historical Museum proved to be an unexpected delight. Even better, admission is offered at half price with the BaselCard - an excellent incentive to explore this cultural treasure.\n\nHoused within a former church, the museum's main floor offers a serene and evocative backdrop for its impressive collection of religious art. Particularly captivating are the three meticulously crafted city models of Basel, spanning from ancient times to the present - a real treat for urban history enthusiasts.\n\nThough all informational panels are in German, visitors are thoughtfully guided at the ticket counter to access detailed descriptions in English and French via a QR code, with free Wi-Fi available throughout the museum - a welcome gesture for international guests.\n\nThe true highlight, however, lies in the basement: an extraordinary trove of historical wonders. From ornate jewelry and period furniture to curious artifacts, weapons, and full-scale reconstructions of Gothic interiors, the collection is both diverse and beautifully presented. It is well worth allowing ample time to explore this captivating subterranean gallery in its entirety.",
