            "text": "I have travelled the world extensively over 40 years. I ate at all restaurants ranging from pop & mom's to Michelin three stars. This is my honest review of the restaurant L'Aparté, inside Hotel Royal in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nAn exceptional dining experience! We opted for the six-course surprise menu, which, along with two bottles of champagne, turned out to be very reasonably priced given the outstanding quality of the food.\n\nThe meal started with a variety of amuse-bouches, each offering distinct and vibrant flavors that awakened the palate. This was followed by two different starters, with the standout dish being a perfectly cooked scallop that left a lasting impression.\n\nThe main courses were equally remarkable. The cod fillet was beautifully prepared, enhanced by a variety of well-balanced flavors, while the pork from Jussy (Geneva canton) was exquisitely cooked and paired with a delightful sauce. In fact, every dish featured unique and carefully crafted sauces with spices that brought a refreshing twist to the flavors, creating a perfect harmony across the courses.\n\nWe opted for the cheese selection, which included four pre-selected cheeses. While we didn't get to choose them individually, the selection was interesting-though the order of tasting could be debated. Dessert preceded by a pre-dessert were both delicious, but the savory courses impressed me the most.\n\nThe service was impeccable, with the chef personally presenting each dish at the table. While he didn't speak English, a waiter seamlessly translated his explanations for the English speakers in our group. The staff was extremely attentive and welcoming, adding to the overall experience.\n\nThe restaurant's ambiance was elegant, with a beautifully crafted wooden table for six, offering both style and comfort. Tables were well spaced, allowing for relaxed conversations, and the decor was tastefully done.\n\nAs for parking, they offer a valet service, which can initially be a bit tricky to locate. However, by following the reception's directions, the valet service turned out to be efficient and convenient, providing quick access to the hotel.\n\nOverall, a truly memorable evening-I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a refined and creative culinary experience!",

They perfectly accommodated our dietary restrictions - me being vegan and my husband allergic to shellfish - despite their usual menu that evening being heavy in shellfish. We did the seven course option and the food was better than some two and three star Michelin restaurants we've enjoyed. Perhaps the best meal we've had. The only course that fell flat for me was the 6th, the vegan pre-dessert, which was a dish of strawberries and strawberry gel. I like strawberries as much as the next person, but would have liked a little more variety in this dish. The best courses were the carrot carpaccio second course and the celeriac fourth course, both of which were downright phenomenal.\n\nSecond, the drinks! Their sommelier is personable and suggested great wines. The cocktails I enjoyed - a cucumber cocktail with gin and an espresso martini - were delicious pairings.\n\nThird, the service - despite us having limited French skills, the chef visited our table to introduce every course, translated by the manager. The manager was also wonderful to chat with!",

Unfortunately, our evening was overshadowed by several disappointing experiences, and the restaurant did not live up to our expectations.\n\nPositives:\n•The atmosphere was interesting and engaging.\n•The music was great.\n•There was a decent variety of dishes to choose from.\n\nNegatives:\n1.Upon being seated, we were politely reminded that we needed to vacate our table by 9 p.m. for the second seating, which was understandable. However, during the evening, the waiter reminded us of this three more times, and by 8:45 p.m., he was practically hovering over us to ensure we were getting ready to leave. This behavior was extremely frustrating and ruined the dining experience.\n2.To our shock, the glasses were not replaced at all. After drinking champagne, we were served both white and red wine in the same glasses. This is unacceptable, especially for a restaurant positioning itself as a high-end establishment.\n3.After dinner, we asked to be seated near the bar. However, the waiter together with the manager refused our request, claiming it would be “too tight” for us. This was outright rude, leaving a very negative impression.\n\nIn conclusion, the restaurant failed to meet the standards of a fine dining venue.",

This is my honest review of the restaurant Nagomi.\n\nI had the pleasure of dining at this Japanese restaurant located near the train station in Geneva, and it was an exceptional experience. The menu is impressively extensive, offering a wide variety of fish and seafood for sashimi and sushi. Every selection I made was of outstanding quality, with prime freshness that truly stood out.\n\nThe miso soup and green tea were perfect companions to the meal, offering a comforting warmth on a cold day. The interior is simple and unpretentious, as one might expect from an authentic Japanese establishment, but I particularly appreciated the counter seating. It was a delight to watch the sushi chef at work, adding an extra layer of authenticity to the experience.\n\nFinally, the price-to-value ratio was very good, making it a highly satisfying meal overall. I wholeheartedly recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking quality Japanese cuisine in Geneva.",

On top of that, we were seated next to the door, which was constantly left open, making it uncomfortably chilly.\n\nIn short, while we enjoyed the food, the long wait and lack of attention to comfort and service made the experience not worth returning.",

But unfortunately we did not have a good experience coming here on a busy weekend dinner service.\n\nThe service although polite was very slow, with the wine only coming on second asking with the food taking a good part of one hour between starter and mains. This seemed to be across the whole restaurant as the table next to us who ordered at the same time did not have their main course by the time we left.\n\nFurther to this the food itself was hit and miss, the prawn calamari although looking spectacular (with prawn heads and all) was soggy and poorly executed. The lobster pasta tasted mainly of cream and not much else. The rock fish and arancini however were very good (fish cooked perfectly flakey and arancini crispy) and would happily eat again.\n\nIt is a charming Italian bistro providing more than just the standard pasta and pizza choices that you see so much of in Geneva making this particular all the more disappointing. However there are many decent eateries in the area and so they need to be more consistent. I want to come again and be proven wrong and will be more than happy to change my review but for now hope my review will be learnt from rather than ignored.",

It's not the largest restaurant, but not cramped either.\n\nWe had the boar ragu with papardele and the truffles risotto.  Both were incredible.  The risotto was al dente and creamy with an abundance of shaved truffles. The boar ragu was with some vegetables and was delicate, tender and light. The sauce and pasta blended seamlessly.\n\nOverall a splendid menu with a great wine selection as well. Enjoy!",

Highly recommend and would absolutely go back.\n\nThe ingredients were of the absolute highest quality. I've spent weeks in Italy and have dined at many fine restaurants, this was some of the freshest tasting pasta I've ever had. The burrata was exceptional as well.\n\nAlso, order the tiramisu and the strawberry dessert. They were both incredible. If staying at the hotel, you absolutely must book this restaurant. If the service and quality was this good as room service, imagine how amazing it must be in the restaurant. The enter staff was flawless. 10/10",

As advice I suggest to not sit close to the entrance as I asked to close the door due to the noise from the bar but they said that the entrance had to stay open... The food is high quality, well presented small portions, I personally liked everything except the tiramisu that I would have kept on a traditional way, this kind of semifreddo was not tasty and difficult to eat. Instead very suggested is the affogato!! Overall I recommend but for the price, I was a little upset by these two aforementioned things.",
