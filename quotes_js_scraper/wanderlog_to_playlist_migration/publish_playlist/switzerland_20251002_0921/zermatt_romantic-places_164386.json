The journey up, via a series of gondolas, builds anticipation with every stop, and once you reach the top, the panoramic views are absolutely breathtaking. Standing at over 12,700 feet, with snow-covered peaks stretching across Switzerland, France, and Italy, it truly feels like you're on top of the world.\n\nOne of the most unique features is the Ice Palace, an ethereal experience where you walk inside a glacier. The cool, quiet tunnels carved into the ice are unlike anything I've seen before, with sculptures and shimmering walls that make the whole experience feel dreamlike.\n\nThe combination of the Ice Palace, the observation deck, and the surreal stillness at that altitude created a moment of awe I wasn't expecting. It's more than just a viewpoint; it's a space that invites you to pause, breathe deeply, and feel small in the best possible way. Despite the high elevation, the facilities were incredibly well maintained, and everything felt thoughtfully designed for visitors.\n\nFor anyone visiting Zermatt, this isn't just a scenic stop, it's a once-in-a-lifetime experience that stays with you long after you descend.",

Their support made a potentially stressful situation feel safe and manageable. We couldn't have asked for better hosts and can't wait to come back! Truly wonderful place to stay.",

It was a nice surprise since the hotel had the most friendly staff, clean and modern rooms, and their spa facility was amazing. The family provided breakfast every morning with a nice array at the freshly prepared buffet. One thing that really stood out was the hospitality of the family (especially Rachel) and  their dedicated staff (Caroline in particular). We arrived just prior to a once in a lifetime storm that knocked out power and access to Zermatt for 72 hours. Everyone at the hotel went above and beyond to help accommodate their guests under extraordinary circumstances. The way they handled their guests with such a personalized service made us feel at home. I most certainly will return  to Zermatt and this would be the first hotel I would choose for my vacation. Thank you for the hospitality and making us feel like family during our stay. Hopefully next time there won't be a crazy storm so we are able to ski the mountains!",

You also learn about the mountaineers who lost their lives while climbing Matterhorn, the challenges faced by them, the lifestyle and history of Zermatt village and much more. The entire museum is underground and there are free lockers available to keep your luggage. As the museum opens in afternoon you can come here after your Gornergrat Matterhorn visit. It is close to  Zermatt station just a 10 minute walk. Matterhorn museum is free with Swiss Travel Pass.\n\nTip: The museum focuses more on history of Matterhorn and Zermatt. If you don't like history you might find this place boring.",

Zero complaints though- it was DELICIOUS.  If I could find a bottle of their garlic sauce I would die happy. Though, All the sauces and flavors were truly great.  Our waitress was so sweet and spoke more languages than google.  We really enjoyed ourselves and if we had stayed longer we would have returned for the cheese fondue.  Best to make a reservation as they were busy- Was very easy to do the reservation online.  Only recommendation would be to read the menu very well-  or end up with a happy cheese free accident like us!",
