              "reviewText": "The Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple is not just a sacred site — it’s the spiritual heartbeat of Varanasi, and one of the most powerful places I’ve ever visited. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple radiates an aura that’s difficult to put into words but deeply felt the moment you step inside the complex.\n\nDespite the high footfall of devotees and tight security, everything is incredibly well-organized. The temple staff and volunteers guide you with patience and respect, ensuring everyone gets their darshan peacefully. The architecture itself is a beautiful blend of tradition and majesty — the golden spire gleams against the sky, a symbol of Varanasi’s eternal spirit.\n\nWhat struck me most was the intensity of devotion. Standing in front of the Jyotirlinga, with chants of “Har Har Mahadev” filling the air, I felt a rare kind of stillness — a connection with something far beyond the physical. Whether you're deeply religious or just spiritually curious, the energy inside the sanctum is palpable.\n\nEarly morning visits are especially powerful — the aarti, the sound of bells, and the scent of sandalwood and incense create a soul-stirring atmosphere. The newly developed Kashi Vishwanath Corridor has beautifully transformed the area around the temple — making it more spacious, accessible, and visually stunning while retaining its sacred vibe.\n\nThere are small shrines and courtyards throughout the complex that are worth exploring, each with its own story and significance. Don’t miss spending a few quiet moments at the Ganga-facing side of the corridor — it's peaceful and offers an incredible view of the river.\n\nThis temple is not just a destination — it’s a spiritual moment, a living tradition, and a place where the past, present, and divine converge. Visiting Kashi Vishwanath is more than a religious journey — it’s an emotional, cultural, and soulful experience."

This is the heart of spiritual India, especially during the famous Ganga Aarti that takes place every evening. The atmosphere is electric — chants, bells, and the sight of hundreds of lamps illuminating the river create an experience that words can hardly capture.\n\nHowever, it's important to plan ahead! The ghat gets extremely crowded, with devotees and tourists filling every inch of space. I would highly recommend reaching by 4 PM if you want a front-level seat. After that, it becomes almost impossible to even find a place to stand. Despite the rush, witnessing the Ganga Aarti up close is absolutely worth every bit of effort.\n\nThe energy, the devotion, and the stunning views of the Ganges under the evening sky make it an unforgettable memory. If you truly want to feel the soul of Varanasi, Dashashwamedh Ghat is the place to be."

              "reviewText": "Dashashwamedh Ghat is undoubtedly one of the most iconic and spiritually significant places in Varanasi. Set along the banks of the sacred Ganga, the ghat offers a deeply peaceful experience—especially during the early mornings or late nights when the crowds are thinner. The calmness of the river, the chanting of mantras in the background, and the occasional ring of temple bells together create a truly serene atmosphere that is difficult to put into words.\n\nOne of the main highlights here is the Ganga Aarti, which takes place every evening around sunset. It’s a grand, mesmerizing ritual performed by priests with synchronized movements, conch shells, and flaming lamps. The entire event is visually stunning and spiritually moving. However, it does get extremely crowded during the Aarti, so it’s a good idea to arrive early if you want a decent spot to watch. Alternatively, watching it from a boat offers a less congested and equally beautiful perspective.\n\nSpeaking of boats, rides are easily available and highly recommended—especially during sunrise or sunset. A boat ride along the ghats allows you to witness the full stretch of Varanasi’s sacred riverfront, dotted with temples, historic structures, and daily life unfolding in its rawest form. It’s a peaceful, reflective experience that complements the energy of the ghat itself.\n\nAnother positive point is the cleanliness. Compared to some other ghats, Dashashwamedh is relatively well-maintained, especially considering the huge number of visitors it attracts daily. Authorities and volunteers seem to make a good effort to keep the place tidy, though peak hours do bring some inevitable crowd-related littering.\n\nIn summary, Dashashwamedh Ghat is a must-visit if you're in Varanasi—not just for its religious significance, but for the unique energy it offers. Whether you're a spiritual seeker, a culture lover, or simply someone looking to experience the soul of the city, this ghat captures it all. Just be prepared for crowds during popular times and plan accordingly for the best experience."

              "reviewText": "Nestled along the sacred banks of the River Ganges in the ancient city of Varanasi, Dasaswamedh Ghat is a spiritual epicenter that captivates the soul. For anyone traveling to India to explore its spiritual heartland, this ghat stands as an essential experience. I visited Varanasi with the hope of connecting with India’s deep cultural and religious roots, and what I witnessed at Dasaswamedh Ghat exceeded my expectations in every sense. From dawn till dusk, it is a vibrant confluence of life, spirituality, chaos, and tranquility. But it’s the Ganga Aarti at dusk that seals this place in your memory forever.\n\n⸻\n\nFirst Impressions: The Ghat’s Timeless Aura\n\nAs I stepped onto Dasaswamedh Ghat for the first time, I was immediately struck by the overwhelming energy of the place. The name Dasaswamedh translates to “the place of ten sacrificed horses,” believed to be where Lord Brahma performed the ten-horse sacrifice to welcome Lord Shiva. The mythological significance is deeply rooted in the very stones of this ghat, and you can feel that sacred aura in the air.\n\nThe ghat is a wide stretch of steps that descend to the river, flanked by temples and bustling with pilgrims, locals, sadhus, hawkers, and tourists. Early mornings reveal yogis meditating, locals taking ritual baths, and priests performing pujas (prayers) — all creating a living, breathing rhythm of devotion. The sound of temple bells and chanting mantras adds to the ethereal charm.\n\n⸻\n\nRiver Ganges: Sacred, Alive, and All-Embracing\n\nThe Ganges is more than just a river — she is “Maa Ganga”, a living goddess for millions. Watching people bathe in her waters, immersing themselves in prayers or scattering ashes of loved ones, I couldn’t help but reflect on the significance of this river in Indian spirituality. I took a morning boat ride from Assi Ghat to Dasaswamedh, and seeing the sun rise over the ghats, turning the river golden, was a moment of surreal beauty.\n\nBoatmen share stories, legends, and snippets of local wisdom, and even if you don’t speak Hindi, the emotion and reverence they express toward the river are palpable. For a tourist, it is humbling — the sheer scale of human faith on display is unlike anything I’ve ever witnessed.\n\n⸻\n\nGanga Aarti: A Theatrical Devotion to the Divine\n\nEvery evening, just after sunset, Dasaswamedh Ghat transforms into an open-air temple of cosmic proportions. The Ganga Aarti, performed by a group of young priests (pandits), is a coordinated ritual of light, sound, and devotion that feels more like a spiritual performance than a religious ceremony.\n\nWe arrived around 5:30 PM to secure a good spot — I recommend getting there early, as crowds swell quickly. You can either find a place on the steps or, better yet, hire a boat and watch the ceremony from the river itself, which provides a majestic front-row view.\n\nAs darkness begins to fall, the priests dressed in traditional saffron and gold robes arrive with incense sticks, conch shells, and large multi-tiered oil lamps. The Aarti begins with the chanting of Vedic hymns and the blowing of conch shells. Then, in a perfectly synchronized flow, the priests begin their rituals — rotating the lamps in elaborate circular motions, creating patterns of light and smoke that rise toward the heavens.\n\nThe atmosphere becomes electric. Hundreds of spectators chant “Har Har Gange,” while others simply close their eyes, lost in prayer or awe. The scent of sandalwood, camphor, and burning ghee fills the air. The Ganga, meanwhile, glows with hundreds of diyas (oil lamps) floating in small leaf boats offered by the devotees.\n\nNo video or photograph can do justice to the energy and reverence of this moment. It’s one of the rare experiences where religious ritual becomes a multisensory spectacle, enveloping you in spirituality regardless of your own beliefs. Even as a foreigner or outsider to the Hindu tradition, I felt moved and strangely at peace."

Steeped in mythology, it is believed that Lord Brahma performed ten Ashwamedha Yajnas here, giving the ghat its name. It stands as a focal point for both devotees and tourists alike.\n\nThe ghat comes alive at dawn with pilgrims taking holy dips, and reaches its spiritual peak in the evening during the famous Ganga Aarti. The synchronized chanting of mantras, rhythmic beating of drums, and the sight of priests performing rituals with large brass lamps create a divine ambiance that leaves every visitor mesmerized. Watching hundreds of floating diyas (lamps) on the river during Aarti is truly a soul-stirring experience.\n\nThe surroundings are bustling with local vendors, flower sellers, and spiritual seekers. Boat rides at sunrise offer a panoramic view of the ghats and temples lining the riverbank. Despite the crowds, the energy here is deeply calming and devotional.\n\nIn essence, Dashashwamedh Ghat is not just a tourist attraction but a timeless symbol of India’s spiritual heritage, offering a unique blend of faith, tradition, and visual grandeur that lingers in the heart long after a visit."

We went there for best cadet camp selection, CATC, TSC training, and firing practice, and every single day was full of excitement and learning. The firing sessions taught us discipline and focus, while the drills and physical training kept us fit and motivated. We had ground discussions that encouraged teamwork and leadership, and the environment was always filled with energy thanks to all the singing, dancing, and cultural activities in the evenings. The 28 UP Girls Battalion really felt like a second family—everyone supported each other, and no one ever felt left out. We made so many new friends from different places, including naval cadets who joined in and shared their own stories and skills, making our experience even more diverse and fun. The camp staff and instructors were strict yet caring, always pushing us to do our best while making sure we were safe and learning the right way. The food was another highlight: five tasty meals a day including snacks, making sure we were always full of energy for the next activity. We loved sitting together in the mess hall, sharing jokes and stories. Even simple things like standing in line for meals, preparing for inspection, or late-night chats in the barracks became moments we’ll never forget. Honestly, none of us wanted to go back home because the bonds we built and the memories we created here were so special. Overall, the BHU NCC camp wasn’t just about training—it was about friendship, discipline, fun, and growing into better versions of ourselves."

Spread across an acre, The temple tower is a massive structure standing at over 50 feet from base. The temple itself is made of marble and the interior is pretty neat, well maintained.\n\nOn the first floor, you'll also find individual temples of Bhagwan Shri Satyanarayana and Bhagwan Bholenaath both of which are made of Marble.\n\nIf you're lucky, you'll also find a tabla-vaadak tuning his fingers on the tabla in the morning just in front of Bhole baba's temple.\n\nThe landscape is lush green having few benches to relax and unwind.\n\nThe surroundings streets of the temple are flocked by hawkers selling garlands, flowers and sweets and plenty parking space for two wheelers.\n\nBottom line, when in Varanasi, you have to visit BHU too."

              "reviewText": "A very peaceful place . Bharat Kala Bhawan is truly one of the gems inside Banaras Hindu University. It is not just a museum but a journey through India’s history, culture, and art. The collection is vast and diverse — from ancient sculptures, coins, and terracotta pieces to exquisite miniature paintings and textiles. What I loved the most was how beautifully the museum preserves the essence of India’s heritage in one place.\n\nThe galleries are well-organized, and each section has detailed information that makes it easier to understand the historical importance of the artifacts. The miniature painting section, in particular, is mesmerizing — it feels like stepping back into the Mughal and Rajput eras.\n\nAnother special aspect is the connection of Bharat Kala Bhawan with Banaras itself. Many exhibits reflect the cultural richness of Varanasi, its traditions, and its role as a living museum of Indian heritage.\n\nOverall, my visit was enriching and peaceful. It’s a must-visit for students, researchers, or anyone interested in art and history. The museum is not too crowded, which makes it easy to explore at your own pace.\n\n⭐ Rating: 4.5/5 — A beautiful treasure house of Indian culture worth visiting at least once!"

While millions come to Kashi for darshan of Baba Vishwanath, many remain unaware that Maa Vishalakshi, one of the 51 Shaktipeethas, resides just nearby, radiating immense spiritual energy and motherly compassion.\n\nThis temple holds immense significance, it is believed to be the sacred spot where Maa Sati’s earrings (kundal) fell, making it a spiritually charged site where Shakti and Shiva dwell in eternal union. For seekers of Shakti (divine feminine energy) and inner awakening, this temple is a must-visit.\n\nDespite its spiritual power, it often remains out of the typical pilgrimage itinerary. But once you enter the serene sanctum and gaze upon Maa Vishalakshi's murti adorned in vibrant sarees and flowers, you will feel an instant connection, as if a mother is embracing her child.\n\n🛕 Temple Tips:\n\nIt’s just a short walk from Kashi Vishwanath Temple and Manikarnika Ghat.\n\nThe temple is peaceful and less crowded, making it perfect for quiet devotion.\n\nDevotees often offer sarees, bangles, and sindoor to the Devi.\n\nIf you’re visiting Kashi, don’t miss this sacred jewel. Your spiritual journey will feel incomplete without seeking the blessings of Maa Vishalakshi, the all-seeing, all-loving Mother of Kashi.\n\n🔱 Jai Maa Vishalakshi! 🔱"

              "reviewText": "Manikarnika Ghat is one of the famous and unique ghats by the Ganga River. It is different from other ghats because it is where Hindus burn dead bodies. People believe that burning a body here helps the soul become free from being born and dying again, which they call Moksha.\nEarly one morning, around 4 AM in December 2024, we went to Manikarnika Ghat. It was the third time we had been to this place. We were there to join the line for the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Darshan and the path took us through Manikarnika Ghat. It was very crowded because of the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. As we walked, we saw many funeral pyres where bodies were being burned. We stopped for a moment to respect the people who had died. Watching the burning pyres and the priests doing their rituals made us feel sad. It was a very deep and emotional experience. The flames went up high, and there was a unique,old smell. It made us think about how short life is. But that feeling didn't last long, and we got caught up in the usual things of life again. We continued walking through the ghat to reach the temple line, leaving the burning bodies behind, even though that's the truth of life. Visiting Manikarnika Ghat was a powerful experience. Seeing the cremations made us think a lot about life and death. We got to see ancient Hindu traditions being practiced. The ghat is always busy, with funeral fires burning all day and night by the Ganga River. Lastly,the ghat’s message is that death is the ultimate truth."

As one of the oldest and most sacred cremation ghats in India, it holds deep spiritual meaning for Hindus who believe that being cremated here grants liberation (moksha) from the cycle of rebirth.\nThe atmosphere is intense and humbling. Funeral pyres burn day and night, reminding visitors of the impermanence of life. Despite the sorrow surrounding death, there’s a profound sense of peace and acceptance. The rituals, the chants, and the unwavering flame of the sacred fire offer a deeply reflective and spiritual experience.\nIt’s not a tourist spot in the usual sense—it's a living, breathing place of faith, tradition, and raw human emotion. Visiting Manikarnika Ghat is a stark but moving encounter with the spiritual heart of India."

It was built by Raja Man Singh of Amer in the 16th century, and the palace that stands on it is a beautiful example of Rajput-Mughal architecture. The ghat itself, with its broad stone steps, offers a tranquil space for pilgrims and visitors to connect with the holy Ganges River.\n​The site is also a place of great scientific importance. Perched on top of the palace is an astronomical observatory, which was constructed by Raja Jai Singh II, a descendant of Raja Man Singh. This observatory, often referred to as Jantar Mantar, houses various masonry instruments designed to measure time and study celestial bodies.\n​The Man Mandir Palace and its ghat are a visual spectacle, especially at night when the stone facade is illuminated, reflecting a serene glow on the river. The intricately carved windows and balconies, or jharokhas, add to the architectural grandeur. A stroll here provides a peaceful escape from the bustle of the city.\n​In conclusion, Man Mandir Ghat is more than just a place for ritual bathing. It's a blend of spiritual devotion, architectural excellence, and scientific history. The palace and observatory stand as silent witnesses to centuries of tradition and innovation, making it a truly unique and enriching destination."

Built in the early 17th century by Raja Man Singh of Amber, this ghat is not only a place of devotion but also a testament to the architectural and intellectual pursuits of its time. Its sandstone façade, adorned with delicate carvings and arched balconies, reflects the elegance of Rajput and Mughal styles, offering a visual treat to those who appreciate historical depth.\n\nWhat truly sets Man Mandir Ghat apart is the presence of the Man Mandir Observatory, perched atop the adjoining palace. This ancient astronomical center, equipped with instruments like sundials and celestial trackers, was once used to study the movements of stars and planets. It adds a fascinating scientific layer to the spiritual atmosphere, reminding visitors that Varanasi has long been a cradle of both faith and knowledge.\n\nThe ghat itself is serene and less crowded than its more famous neighbors, making it an ideal spot for quiet reflection. Pilgrims come here to perform rituals and offer prayers to the Ganga, while travelers often pause to admire the panoramic views of the river and the city’s skyline. The nearby temples—such as Rameshwara and Someshwara—add to the sacred ambiance, creating a space where devotion and history coexist in harmony.\n\nMan Mandir Ghat is a place where time seems to slow down. Whether you're watching the sunrise shimmer on the water, listening to the soft murmur of prayers, or exploring the observatory’s ancient instruments, the experience is both grounding and uplifting. It invites you to see Varanasi not just as a city of temples, but as a living museum of India’s spiritual and intellectual legacy."

During times of high water, the temple has even been partially submerged.\n\nThis leaning temple is a must-see when visiting Varanasi. It's a reminder of the city's long and complex history and the powerful forces of nature."

Situated along the sacred riverbanks of the Ganges, this temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is one of the revered Pancha Krosha Parikrama sites.\n\nThe temple's architecture reflects a blend of traditional Hindu design elements. Its sanctum sanctorum houses a Shiva Lingam, the phallic representation of Lord Shiva, which is the focal point of devotion and prayers for the devotees.\n\nWhat sets the Kashi Karvat Temple apart is its association with the Kashi Karvat Mahatmya, a sacred scripture narrating the glory and divine history of the temple. Legends recount that a devout Brahmin named Chandraprabha had a vision of Lord Shiva here, leading to the temple's establishment.\n\nThousands of pilgrims flock to this holy site annually, especially during auspicious occasions like Mahashivaratri and other significant Hindu festivals. Devotees engage in rituals, prayers, and circumambulation around the temple premises, seeking blessings, spiritual solace, and fulfillment of their desires.\n\nThe temple's serene ambiance, embellished with rituals, chanting of mantras, and the fragrance of incense, creates an atmosphere of profound spirituality. Its location by the Ganges enhances the spiritual experience, as devotees often engage in the sacred act of taking a dip in the holy river before visiting the temple.\n\nThe Kashi Karvat Temple stands as a testament to the deep-rooted religious fervor and devotion of people toward Lord Shiva in the sacred city of Varanasi, making it a significant religious landmark in India's spiritual landscape.🕉️🙏"

              "reviewText": "The Sankat Mochan Hanuman temple is a very old and important temple in India, believed to be around 400 years old. It is said Goswami Tulsidas Ji, who wrote Ramcharitmanas, built it sometime between 1631 and 1680. It is believed Hanuman Ji himself inspired Tulsidas Ji when he was writing RamCharitmanas, and that Tulsidas Ji even met Hanuman Ji at this very place. Hanuman Ji is present here in the form of Soil( Mitti). Devotees believe that just by visiting the temple and seeing the statue of Hanuman Ji, their problems will be solved. Every year, on a specific day (Kartik Krishna Chaturdashi), a special morning prayer is held. Special prayers and events are also held during Ramnavmi, Diwali and Hanuman Jayanti. The temple has a small museum to learn about Hanuman Ji. The temple also does charity work helping orphans and poor families. The temple has tight security, and no phones are allowed inside. When we went, it was very crowded because of Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. People were slowly moving in line, chanting \"Jai Hanuman.\" It was all very peaceful and spiritual. Across from this temple is another temple for Sri Ram Ji,Devi Sita and Lakshman Ji. Hanuman Ji's statue faces them directly. Near the entrance, shops sell sweets and offerings for Hanuman Ji like Besan Laddu, Sindoor & Yellow dress. There is parking for bikes in front of the main Gate, but cars have to park elsewhere. There are lockers for phones and electronics. You can leave your shoes outside or at a shop where you buy offerings. This temple is a must-see in Varanasi, along with other famous temples like Kashi Vishwanath and Kaal Bhairav."

Built by Maharaja Chet Singh in the 18th century, the fort played a crucial role during his resistance against British forces, making it a site of historical significance.\n\nPerched along the Ganges River, the fort offers stunning views of the river and its surrounding ghats, making it a picturesque destination for visitors. Though much of the structure is now in ruins, the remnants of its walls, gates, and courtyards evoke a sense of grandeur and resilience. The fort's architecture reflects a blend of Mughal and Rajput styles, adding to its historical charm.\n\nThe fort is a relatively quiet spot compared to the bustling ghats, providing a peaceful escape for those seeking to explore Varanasi’s less commercialized sites. It is an ideal place for history enthusiasts, photographers, and those who enjoy exploring offbeat locations.\n\nHowever, the fort suffers from neglect, with limited restoration and maintenance efforts. Lack of proper signage and information about its history can leave visitors feeling underwhelmed. Additionally, there are occasional complaints about litter and poor upkeep in the area.\n\nDespite these shortcomings, Chet Singh Fort remains a must-visit for those interested in Varanasi’s history and culture. Its scenic location and historical importance make it a hidden gem that deserves more attention and care from both authorities and visitors."

It was built by Raja Man Singh of Amer in the 16th century, and the palace that stands on it is a beautiful example of Rajput-Mughal architecture. The ghat itself, with its broad stone steps, offers a tranquil space for pilgrims and visitors to connect with the holy Ganges River.\n​The site is also a place of great scientific importance. Perched on top of the palace is an astronomical observatory, which was constructed by Raja Jai Singh II, a descendant of Raja Man Singh. This observatory, often referred to as Jantar Mantar, houses various masonry instruments designed to measure time and study celestial bodies.\n​The Man Mandir Palace and its ghat are a visual spectacle, especially at night when the stone facade is illuminated, reflecting a serene glow on the river. The intricately carved windows and balconies, or jharokhas, add to the architectural grandeur. A stroll here provides a peaceful escape from the bustle of the city.\n​In conclusion, Man Mandir Ghat is more than just a place for ritual bathing. It's a blend of spiritual devotion, architectural excellence, and scientific history. The palace and observatory stand as silent witnesses to centuries of tradition and innovation, making it a truly unique and enriching destination."

The Ghat is named after his surname, becoming known as Man Temple Ghat. In 1831, it was first mentioned by James Prinsep. Before that, it was called Someshwar Ghat until the 18th century.\n\nThis Ghat is notable for its large artistic palace and a place called Nakshatra Vaidhshala, which has both religious and cultural importance. The palace showcases the architectural styles of the Mathura Govardhan temple and the Rajasthani Rajput style from the North Medieval Period.\n\nRaja Sawai Jai Singh, a descendant of Raja Mansingh, established the Nakshatra Vaidhshala in the 17th century, with plans made by a famous astrologer named Samrath Jagannath. Various astrological instruments, like Samrat Yantra and Naadi Valay Yantra, can be found in the Vaidhshala."

Built in the early 17th century by Raja Man Singh of Amber, this ghat is not only a place of devotion but also a testament to the architectural and intellectual pursuits of its time. Its sandstone façade, adorned with delicate carvings and arched balconies, reflects the elegance of Rajput and Mughal styles, offering a visual treat to those who appreciate historical depth.\n\nWhat truly sets Man Mandir Ghat apart is the presence of the Man Mandir Observatory, perched atop the adjoining palace. This ancient astronomical center, equipped with instruments like sundials and celestial trackers, was once used to study the movements of stars and planets. It adds a fascinating scientific layer to the spiritual atmosphere, reminding visitors that Varanasi has long been a cradle of both faith and knowledge.\n\nThe ghat itself is serene and less crowded than its more famous neighbors, making it an ideal spot for quiet reflection. Pilgrims come here to perform rituals and offer prayers to the Ganga, while travelers often pause to admire the panoramic views of the river and the city’s skyline. The nearby temples—such as Rameshwara and Someshwara—add to the sacred ambiance, creating a space where devotion and history coexist in harmony.\n\nMan Mandir Ghat is a place where time seems to slow down. Whether you're watching the sunrise shimmer on the water, listening to the soft murmur of prayers, or exploring the observatory’s ancient instruments, the experience is both grounding and uplifting. It invites you to see Varanasi not just as a city of temples, but as a living museum of India’s spiritual and intellectual legacy."

The total distance is about 6 km, which is quite doable. I did this in the late afternoon, but I guess it would be more pleasant if done early in the morning.\nOn many 'Ghats', you will find umpteen numbers of people taking 'holy' baths in the Ganges. So carry your bathing gear, just in case you also feel like taking a dip 😉.\nOf course, if you want to witness the 'Ganga Aarti', then the boat ride or walking has to be done in the evening."

I would strongly recommend that you reach Assi Ghat by 5 am, enjoy the wonderful Ganga Aarti and then catch the shared boat at about 5:45 am. This boat will charge you Rs 50/100 per person, and offer the most amazing views of the ghats while you watch sunrise,Subah-e-Banaras, in parallel.This boat tour is combination of a boat ride and a walking tour of the southern part of the old city to explore the cultural diversity of Varanasi along with the oldest alive site in the whole Varanasi and a ‘Akhaada’ !!"

Varanasi is amongst the seven most sacred cities of India which are known as Saptapuri's. The Varanasi ISKCON temple was built in 1699 as part of a network of Vaishnavite temples by the International; Society of Krishna Consciousness.\n\nTemple Architecture:\nThe temple's architecture reflects a blend traditional Indian design and aesthetics. Intricately carved idols of Radha Krishna adorn the sanctum, evoking deep spiritual devotion. The temple's environment provides an ideal space for meditation and reflection. Well maintained gardens surrounding the temple gives pleasant atmosphere during your visit.\nThe Idols of Lord Krishna and Radha are positioned in the middle as other ISKCON temples and exquisitely decked with flowers, decorations, and fabrics. We have visited this temple in the evening. At that time Sandhya Aarti performing  and the hall is filled with the chants and Bhajans.\n\nISKCON Varanasi offers regular classes and discourses on the Bhagavat Gita and Bhagavatam. Two of the most prominent festivals celebrated at the temple are Janmashtami and Narsimha Chaturdashi.\n\nTemple Visiting hours:\nMorning 04:30 to 01:00\nEvening  16:00 to 20:30"

Sitting inside and joining the chanting of Hare Krishna filled my heart with joy, devotion, and a deep sense of connection with the Lord.\n✨ If you ever come to Varanasi, I highly recommend visiting this temple. Spend time in chanting, listen to the kirtan, and experience the divine presence yourself. It’s not just a temple—it’s a place where you truly feel Krishna’s love."

              "reviewText": "Don't miss Sarnath if you are visiting Varanasi. It's a major Buddhist archaelogical site (monasteries ruins, Buddhist temple, etc.) that has now developed into a major Buddhist pilgrimage site. There's a lot to see, and if you are an archaeology or Buddhist history enthusiast and have got the time, it's worth a day of exploration. Let me summarize what you can explore here, along with some suggestions:\n\n1) Dhamek Stupa: It's a huge ancient (5th AD) stupa as you can see in the photos, and the main attraction of Sarnath complex. Trust me, it's something, with intricate carvings and strange ancient writings (Brahmi) on its circular wall.\n\n2) Monastery ruins: There are ancient monastery ruins which have been excavated from ground over the century (first by British, then by Indian government). I am not very familiar with the details, but there are some important artifacts and features like Ashokan pillars etc. (on the pillar ruins, there are writings in an ancient Brahmi language).\n\n3) Buddhist Museum: Many important items that have been excavated from the site are stored in this Museum. A must-see place.\n\n4) There are many more noteworthy places to visit nearby,. This includes a very large and beautiful Japanese temple with a sleeping Buddha, a Myanmar-style pagoda, a huge standing Buddha statue inside a Thai monastery complex, Sarnath Buddhist temple, and many more monasteries (we had to miss few due to time constraints, especially as we had seen lots and lots of monasteries in Bodh Gaya 2 years back).\n\n5) International crowd: You will see lots of international tourists here, especially groups from South East Asia and Far East. You will even see entire groups from those Buddhist nations meditating and chanting on the lawns near the monastery ruins. Offers a great peek into Buddhist culture.\n\n6) Neat and well-managed: The entire Sarnath complex is very neat and well-managed. You have ticket counters, online ticket option, wheelchairs, refreshment centers, shopping stalls at the entrance, and so on.\n\nSuggestion: Get tickets online (both Museum & Dhamek Stupa) before visiting as the queue can be quite long at the ticket counter. Also photography is allowed here, so you can take your electronic items with you."

The site holds deep historical and spiritual significance, as it’s believed to be where the Buddha gave his first sermon after enlightenment.\nThe stupa itself is massive and beautifully built, surrounded by well-maintained gardens and other ruins that give you a sense of the area’s importance in ancient times.\nThere’s a quiet, reflective atmosphere, and I’d recommend taking time to walk around slowly and take it all in.\nIf possible, visiting with a guide or reading up a bit beforehand adds a lot to the experience. Definitely worth a visit if you’re in Sarnath or nearby Varanasi."

It commemorates the site where the Buddha gave his first sermon and is located in the city of Sarath, Uttar Pradesh, India. The ground surrounding the structure are very well-maintained – I would even say in perfect condition. There’s also a large garden, which is an immaculate. it is surrounded by shops, including art, galleries, restaurants, Buddhist temples etc. but the site itself is very, very serene and peaceful. Nearby there is a Thai monastery as well as other Buddhist temples in addition to a large Buddhist statue a few minutes down the road.  I would highly recommend visiting this place."

What makes it stand out is the stunning architecture of the old Darbhanga Palace (now part of the BrijRama Palace hotel) that rises right beside the ghat. The grand structure, with its royal design and intricate stonework, gives the ghat a regal charm and makes it one of the most photogenic spots along the Ganga.\n\nThe ghat itself is peaceful compared to some of the busier ones, which makes it a perfect place to sit quietly, watch the river flow, and soak in the spiritual atmosphere. In the morning, the view of the sunrise from Darbhanga Ghat is absolutely mesmerizing, while in the evening you can witness the beautiful Ganga aarti at the nearby Dashashwamedh Ghat.\n\nIt’s also a great spot for photography, boating, and simply enjoying the heritage and culture of Varanasi. Walking along the steps and seeing the grand palace up close feels like stepping back in time.\n\nOverall, Darbhanga Ghat is a must-visit if you want to experience a mix of history, architecture, and serenity in Varanasi.* 🌅🏰✨"

I went there seeking a sense of calm, and I found it by taking a holy Ganga snan (bath) at the ghat. The early morning dip in the river, surrounded by the serene atmosphere, was refreshing and spiritually uplifting. The view of the ancient city along the banks was stunning, and it felt like a step back in time.\n\nAfter the Ganga snan, I visited the famous Kaashi Vishwanath Temple, which is a must-see for anyone visiting Varanasi. The temple's spirituality, combined with the lively surroundings, made it a unique experience. In the evening, I was fortunate to witness the mesmerizing Ganga Aarti—a captivating ceremony filled with chants, lights, and devotion. It’s an experience that truly captures the spirit of Varanasi.\n\nThe fun continued into the night as I explored the streets with friends, enjoying the vibrant night vibes of the city. Varanasi's street food is delicious, and I tried a variety of local delicacies, each bursting with flavor. The bustling lanes, with their night-time energy, were full of charm and excitement.\n\nOverall, Darbhanga Ghat and the surrounding areas offer a perfect blend of peace, spirituality, and fun, making it an unforgettable visit for anyone looking to experience the essence of Varanasi."

For a truly serene experience, I recommend visiting between 3-5 pm in the afternoon and after 11 pm in the evening.\n\nDuring these hours, the ghat exudes a peaceful ambiance, allowing visitors to unwind and rejuvenate their minds. Simply sitting by the ghat, observing the ebb and flow of life along the river, can be a deeply calming experience.\n\nWhether it's the gentle lapping of the water against the steps or the soft murmurs of conversations echoing in the distance, Darbhanga Ghat offers a respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. Take a moment to breathe, to observe, and to let your mind relax in the soothing embrace of this tranquil haven."

It was eventually acquired by the Maharaja of Banaras, Ishwari Narain Singh Ji in 1889, who converted it to a royal guest house. A good 120 years later, the family leased it to the Taj group, that now runs it as a luxury property.",

Approximately eighty six ghats encompass the river bank at Benaras but the sheer architecture and grandeur of Rana Mahal sets it apart from the others. The ornate Rajputi architecture is a reminder of Rana Jagat Singh of Udaipur’s great vision and foresight. Today, however, what was once a Mahal are a row of hotels. Visitors from all over the world come to the Ghat as its sheer proximity to the Dasaswamedh Ghat, where the Maha Aarti takes place, makes it a convenient pitstop. As tourists flock in to lodge here and children learn to swim, the peace and charm of the majestic Mahal is lost."

Whether at sunrise or during the evening Ganga Aarti, the ride is both serene and captivating. Watching the city’s spiritual life unfold along the river, with priests performing rituals and devotees taking holy dips, is truly mesmerizing. Opt for a sunrise ride for peace and beauty or an evening ride to witness the magical Aarti. An unforgettable way to experience the soul of Varanasi"

Departure at dawn, around 5 more or less depending on the season. Cost for 2 people of around 3000/3500Rp according to the agreements. Reliable. Recommended.✌️\n\n(Original)\nConsigliatissimo!\nNon proprio una vera \"agenzia\" (...) ma comunque ha reso l'esperienza molto suggestiva, sepour il Gange fosse in un livello alto rispetto alla media.\nAvevamo contrattato l'itinerario, durata e prezzo il giorno prima con un ragazzo dimostratosi serio e preciso.\nIl servizio da noi richiesto è stato una barca personale che arrivasse fino a Nord di Varanasi per visitare la Moschea (esternamente) per poi riprendere la discesa fino a Assi ghat, il tutto in presenza di un accompagnatore/guida oltre che al pilota della barca.\nLa durata totale della gita è stata di 1 h e 10' come accordato. Partenza all'alba, verso le 5 più o meno a seconda della stagione. Spesa per 2 persone di circa 3000/3500Rp secondo gli accordi. Affidabile. Consigliato.✌️"

We embarked on an unforgettable journey through the labyrinthine alleys and ghats of Varanasi, guided by the knowledgeable and passionate Jeremy at Varanasi Walking Tours.\n\nFrom the moment we met our guide, it was evident that this experience would be exceptional. His deep understanding of Varanasi's history, culture, and religious significance infused every step of our tour with richness and authenticity. As we weaved through the narrow streets, bustling markets, and ancient temples, Jeremy painted vivid pictures of the city's past and present, offering insights that I could never have gleaned on our own.\n\nStanding on the banks, witnessing the rituals of life and death unfolding before our eyes, we were filled with a profound sense of awe and reverence. Jeremy provided invaluable context, explaining the significance of each ritual and the role of the Ganges in Hindu mythology.\n\nBut the tour was not just about sightseeing; it was a multi-sensory experience that engaged all aspects of my being. From the tantalizing aromas wafting from street food stalls to the melodious strains of devotional music echoing through the alleys, every moment was a feast for the senses.\n\nWhat truly set this tour apart, however, was the genuine connections forged along the way. Whether chatting with local artisans or sharing a conversation with residents in a neighborhood we felt welcomed into the fabric of Varanasi's community. These encounters offered a glimpse into the daily lives of its inhabitants and left us with a deeper appreciation for the city's vibrant culture.\n\nPrepare to be enchanted, enlightened, and forever changed by the magic of Varanasi with Varanasi Walking Tours!"

It was eventually acquired by the Maharaja of Banaras, Ishwari Narain Singh Ji in 1889, who converted it to a royal guest house.",

This is the heart of spiritual India, especially during the famous Ganga Aarti that takes place every evening. The atmosphere is electric — chants, bells, and the sight of hundreds of lamps illuminating the river create an experience that words can hardly capture.\n\nHowever, it's important to plan ahead! The ghat gets extremely crowded, with devotees and tourists filling every inch of space. I would highly recommend reaching by 4 PM if you want a front-level seat. After that, it becomes almost impossible to even find a place to stand. Despite the rush, witnessing the Ganga Aarti up close is absolutely worth every bit of effort.\n\nThe energy, the devotion, and the stunning views of the Ganges under the evening sky make it an unforgettable memory. If you truly want to feel the soul of Varanasi, Dashashwamedh Ghat is the place to be."

              "reviewText": "Dashashwamedh Ghat is undoubtedly one of the most iconic and spiritually significant places in Varanasi. Set along the banks of the sacred Ganga, the ghat offers a deeply peaceful experience—especially during the early mornings or late nights when the crowds are thinner. The calmness of the river, the chanting of mantras in the background, and the occasional ring of temple bells together create a truly serene atmosphere that is difficult to put into words.\n\nOne of the main highlights here is the Ganga Aarti, which takes place every evening around sunset. It’s a grand, mesmerizing ritual performed by priests with synchronized movements, conch shells, and flaming lamps. The entire event is visually stunning and spiritually moving. However, it does get extremely crowded during the Aarti, so it’s a good idea to arrive early if you want a decent spot to watch. Alternatively, watching it from a boat offers a less congested and equally beautiful perspective.\n\nSpeaking of boats, rides are easily available and highly recommended—especially during sunrise or sunset. A boat ride along the ghats allows you to witness the full stretch of Varanasi’s sacred riverfront, dotted with temples, historic structures, and daily life unfolding in its rawest form. It’s a peaceful, reflective experience that complements the energy of the ghat itself.\n\nAnother positive point is the cleanliness. Compared to some other ghats, Dashashwamedh is relatively well-maintained, especially considering the huge number of visitors it attracts daily. Authorities and volunteers seem to make a good effort to keep the place tidy, though peak hours do bring some inevitable crowd-related littering.\n\nIn summary, Dashashwamedh Ghat is a must-visit if you're in Varanasi—not just for its religious significance, but for the unique energy it offers. Whether you're a spiritual seeker, a culture lover, or simply someone looking to experience the soul of the city, this ghat captures it all. Just be prepared for crowds during popular times and plan accordingly for the best experience."

              "reviewText": "Nestled along the sacred banks of the River Ganges in the ancient city of Varanasi, Dasaswamedh Ghat is a spiritual epicenter that captivates the soul. For anyone traveling to India to explore its spiritual heartland, this ghat stands as an essential experience. I visited Varanasi with the hope of connecting with India’s deep cultural and religious roots, and what I witnessed at Dasaswamedh Ghat exceeded my expectations in every sense. From dawn till dusk, it is a vibrant confluence of life, spirituality, chaos, and tranquility. But it’s the Ganga Aarti at dusk that seals this place in your memory forever.\n\n⸻\n\nFirst Impressions: The Ghat’s Timeless Aura\n\nAs I stepped onto Dasaswamedh Ghat for the first time, I was immediately struck by the overwhelming energy of the place. The name Dasaswamedh translates to “the place of ten sacrificed horses,” believed to be where Lord Brahma performed the ten-horse sacrifice to welcome Lord Shiva. The mythological significance is deeply rooted in the very stones of this ghat, and you can feel that sacred aura in the air.\n\nThe ghat is a wide stretch of steps that descend to the river, flanked by temples and bustling with pilgrims, locals, sadhus, hawkers, and tourists. Early mornings reveal yogis meditating, locals taking ritual baths, and priests performing pujas (prayers) — all creating a living, breathing rhythm of devotion. The sound of temple bells and chanting mantras adds to the ethereal charm.\n\n⸻\n\nRiver Ganges: Sacred, Alive, and All-Embracing\n\nThe Ganges is more than just a river — she is “Maa Ganga”, a living goddess for millions. Watching people bathe in her waters, immersing themselves in prayers or scattering ashes of loved ones, I couldn’t help but reflect on the significance of this river in Indian spirituality. I took a morning boat ride from Assi Ghat to Dasaswamedh, and seeing the sun rise over the ghats, turning the river golden, was a moment of surreal beauty.\n\nBoatmen share stories, legends, and snippets of local wisdom, and even if you don’t speak Hindi, the emotion and reverence they express toward the river are palpable. For a tourist, it is humbling — the sheer scale of human faith on display is unlike anything I’ve ever witnessed.\n\n⸻\n\nGanga Aarti: A Theatrical Devotion to the Divine\n\nEvery evening, just after sunset, Dasaswamedh Ghat transforms into an open-air temple of cosmic proportions. The Ganga Aarti, performed by a group of young priests (pandits), is a coordinated ritual of light, sound, and devotion that feels more like a spiritual performance than a religious ceremony.\n\nWe arrived around 5:30 PM to secure a good spot — I recommend getting there early, as crowds swell quickly. You can either find a place on the steps or, better yet, hire a boat and watch the ceremony from the river itself, which provides a majestic front-row view.\n\nAs darkness begins to fall, the priests dressed in traditional saffron and gold robes arrive with incense sticks, conch shells, and large multi-tiered oil lamps. The Aarti begins with the chanting of Vedic hymns and the blowing of conch shells. Then, in a perfectly synchronized flow, the priests begin their rituals — rotating the lamps in elaborate circular motions, creating patterns of light and smoke that rise toward the heavens.\n\nThe atmosphere becomes electric. Hundreds of spectators chant “Har Har Gange,” while others simply close their eyes, lost in prayer or awe. The scent of sandalwood, camphor, and burning ghee fills the air. The Ganga, meanwhile, glows with hundreds of diyas (oil lamps) floating in small leaf boats offered by the devotees.\n\nNo video or photograph can do justice to the energy and reverence of this moment. It’s one of the rare experiences where religious ritual becomes a multisensory spectacle, enveloping you in spirituality regardless of your own beliefs. Even as a foreigner or outsider to the Hindu tradition, I felt moved and strangely at peace."

Steeped in mythology, it is believed that Lord Brahma performed ten Ashwamedha Yajnas here, giving the ghat its name. It stands as a focal point for both devotees and tourists alike.\n\nThe ghat comes alive at dawn with pilgrims taking holy dips, and reaches its spiritual peak in the evening during the famous Ganga Aarti. The synchronized chanting of mantras, rhythmic beating of drums, and the sight of priests performing rituals with large brass lamps create a divine ambiance that leaves every visitor mesmerized. Watching hundreds of floating diyas (lamps) on the river during Aarti is truly a soul-stirring experience.\n\nThe surroundings are bustling with local vendors, flower sellers, and spiritual seekers. Boat rides at sunrise offer a panoramic view of the ghats and temples lining the riverbank. Despite the crowds, the energy here is deeply calming and devotional.\n\nIn essence, Dashashwamedh Ghat is not just a tourist attraction but a timeless symbol of India’s spiritual heritage, offering a unique blend of faith, tradition, and visual grandeur that lingers in the heart long after a visit."

It is not just a museum but a journey through India’s history, culture, and art. The collection is vast and diverse — from ancient sculptures, coins, and terracotta pieces to exquisite miniature paintings and textiles. What I loved the most was how beautifully the museum preserves the essence of India’s heritage in one place.\n\nThe galleries are well-organized, and each section has detailed information that makes it easier to understand the historical importance of the artifacts. The miniature painting section, in particular, is mesmerizing — it feels like stepping back into the Mughal and Rajput eras.\n\nAnother special aspect is the connection of Bharat Kala Bhawan with Banaras itself. Many exhibits reflect the cultural richness of Varanasi, its traditions, and its role as a living museum of Indian heritage.\n\nOverall, my visit was enriching and peaceful. It’s a must-visit for students, researchers, or anyone interested in art and history. The museum is not too crowded, which makes it easy to explore at your own pace.\n\n⭐ Rating: 4.5/5 — A beautiful treasure house of Indian culture worth visiting at least once!"

              "reviewText": "The Shri Kashi Vishwanath Temple is not just a sacred site — it’s the spiritual heartbeat of Varanasi, and one of the most powerful places I’ve ever visited. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple radiates an aura that’s difficult to put into words but deeply felt the moment you step inside the complex.\n\nDespite the high footfall of devotees and tight security, everything is incredibly well-organized. The temple staff and volunteers guide you with patience and respect, ensuring everyone gets their darshan peacefully. The architecture itself is a beautiful blend of tradition and majesty — the golden spire gleams against the sky, a symbol of Varanasi’s eternal spirit.\n\nWhat struck me most was the intensity of devotion. Standing in front of the Jyotirlinga, with chants of “Har Har Mahadev” filling the air, I felt a rare kind of stillness — a connection with something far beyond the physical. Whether you're deeply religious or just spiritually curious, the energy inside the sanctum is palpable.\n\nEarly morning visits are especially powerful — the aarti, the sound of bells, and the scent of sandalwood and incense create a soul-stirring atmosphere. The newly developed Kashi Vishwanath Corridor has beautifully transformed the area around the temple — making it more spacious, accessible, and visually stunning while retaining its sacred vibe.\n\nThere are small shrines and courtyards throughout the complex that are worth exploring, each with its own story and significance. Don’t miss spending a few quiet moments at the Ganga-facing side of the corridor — it's peaceful and offers an incredible view of the river.\n\nThis temple is not just a destination — it’s a spiritual moment, a living tradition, and a place where the past, present, and divine converge. Visiting Kashi Vishwanath is more than a religious journey — it’s an emotional, cultural, and soulful experience."

              "reviewText": "Manikarnika Ghat is one of the famous and unique ghats by the Ganga River. It is different from other ghats because it is where Hindus burn dead bodies. People believe that burning a body here helps the soul become free from being born and dying again, which they call Moksha.\nEarly one morning, around 4 AM in December 2024, we went to Manikarnika Ghat. It was the third time we had been to this place. We were there to join the line for the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Darshan and the path took us through Manikarnika Ghat. It was very crowded because of the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. As we walked, we saw many funeral pyres where bodies were being burned. We stopped for a moment to respect the people who had died. Watching the burning pyres and the priests doing their rituals made us feel sad. It was a very deep and emotional experience. The flames went up high, and there was a unique,old smell. It made us think about how short life is. But that feeling didn't last long, and we got caught up in the usual things of life again. We continued walking through the ghat to reach the temple line, leaving the burning bodies behind, even though that's the truth of life. Visiting Manikarnika Ghat was a powerful experience. Seeing the cremations made us think a lot about life and death. We got to see ancient Hindu traditions being practiced. The ghat is always busy, with funeral fires burning all day and night by the Ganga River. Lastly,the ghat’s message is that death is the ultimate truth."

Funeral pyres burn day and night, reminding visitors of the impermanence of life. Despite the sorrow surrounding death, there’s a profound sense of peace and acceptance. The rituals, the chants, and the unwavering flame of the sacred fire offer a deeply reflective and spiritual experience.\nIt’s not a tourist spot in the usual sense—it's a living, breathing place of faith, tradition, and raw human emotion. Visiting Manikarnika Ghat is a stark but moving encounter with the spiritual heart of India."

We went there for best cadet camp selection, CATC, TSC training, and firing practice, and every single day was full of excitement and learning. The firing sessions taught us discipline and focus, while the drills and physical training kept us fit and motivated. We had ground discussions that encouraged teamwork and leadership, and the environment was always filled with energy thanks to all the singing, dancing, and cultural activities in the evenings. The 28 UP Girls Battalion really felt like a second family—everyone supported each other, and no one ever felt left out. We made so many new friends from different places, including naval cadets who joined in and shared their own stories and skills, making our experience even more diverse and fun. The camp staff and instructors were strict yet caring, always pushing us to do our best while making sure we were safe and learning the right way. The food was another highlight: five tasty meals a day including snacks, making sure we were always full of energy for the next activity. We loved sitting together in the mess hall, sharing jokes and stories. Even simple things like standing in line for meals, preparing for inspection, or late-night chats in the barracks became moments we’ll never forget. Honestly, none of us wanted to go back home because the bonds we built and the memories we created here were so special. Overall, the BHU NCC camp wasn’t just about training—it was about friendship, discipline, fun, and growing into better versions of ourselves."

Spread across an acre, The temple tower is a massive structure standing at over 50 feet from base. The temple itself is made of marble and the interior is pretty neat, well maintained.\n\nOn the first floor, you'll also find individual temples of Bhagwan Shri Satyanarayana and Bhagwan Bholenaath both of which are made of Marble.\n\nIf you're lucky, you'll also find a tabla-vaadak tuning his fingers on the tabla in the morning just in front of Bhole baba's temple.\n\nThe landscape is lush green having few benches to relax and unwind.\n\nThe surroundings streets of the temple are flocked by hawkers selling garlands, flowers and sweets and plenty parking space for two wheelers.\n\nBottom line, when in Varanasi, you have to visit BHU too."

              "reviewText": "Manikarnika Ghat is one of the famous and unique ghats by the Ganga River. It is different from other ghats because it is where Hindus burn dead bodies. People believe that burning a body here helps the soul become free from being born and dying again, which they call Moksha.\nEarly one morning, around 4 AM in December 2024, we went to Manikarnika Ghat. It was the third time we had been to this place. We were there to join the line for the Kashi Vishwanath Temple Darshan and the path took us through Manikarnika Ghat. It was very crowded because of the Kumbh Mela in Prayagraj. As we walked, we saw many funeral pyres where bodies were being burned. We stopped for a moment to respect the people who had died. Watching the burning pyres and the priests doing their rituals made us feel sad. It was a very deep and emotional experience. The flames went up high, and there was a unique,old smell. It made us think about how short life is. But that feeling didn't last long, and we got caught up in the usual things of life again. We continued walking through the ghat to reach the temple line, leaving the burning bodies behind, even though that's the truth of life. Visiting Manikarnika Ghat was a powerful experience. Seeing the cremations made us think a lot about life and death. We got to see ancient Hindu traditions being practiced. The ghat is always busy, with funeral fires burning all day and night by the Ganga River. Lastly,the ghat’s message is that death is the ultimate truth."

As one of the oldest and most sacred cremation ghats in India, it holds deep spiritual meaning for Hindus who believe that being cremated here grants liberation (moksha) from the cycle of rebirth.\nThe atmosphere is intense and humbling. Funeral pyres burn day and night, reminding visitors of the impermanence of life. Despite the sorrow surrounding death, there’s a profound sense of peace and acceptance. The rituals, the chants, and the unwavering flame of the sacred fire offer a deeply reflective and spiritual experience.\nIt’s not a tourist spot in the usual sense—it's a living, breathing place of faith, tradition, and raw human emotion. Visiting Manikarnika Ghat is a stark but moving encounter with the spiritual heart of India."

              "reviewText": "A Historical and Mystical Experience at Scindia Ghat**\n\nScindia Ghat in Varanasi is a fascinating place that combines historical significance with mystical charm. Here's a detailed review of my visit:\n\n**Location and Accessibility:**\nScindia Ghat is located north of Dashashwamedh Ghat and can be reached by a short walk from there or by taking a boat ride along the Ganges. It’s easily accessible and well-connected by local transport.\n\n**Atmosphere:**\nThe atmosphere at Scindia Ghat is unique and intriguing. It's less crowded than some of the more popular ghats, offering a quieter and more introspective experience. The ghat is characterized by its partially submerged Shiva temple, which adds a mystical and almost otherworldly quality to the environment. The sound of the river, combined with the sight of the sunken temple and the ancient structures, creates a captivating ambiance.\n\n**Historical and Cultural Significance:**\nScindia Ghat is named after the Scindia (Shinde) family of Madhya Pradesh, who built it in the early 19th century. The ghat is particularly famous for the tilted Shiva temple, which sank partially during its construction. This sunken temple is a major attraction and a subject of many legends and local lore. The ghat is also linked to the birth of Agni, the god of fire, according to Hindu mythology, adding to its spiritual significance.\n\n**Activities:**\n- **Religious Practices:** The ghat is a site for various religious rituals and ceremonies. Devotees often visit the sunken temple to offer prayers.\n- **Exploration:** The ancient architecture and the partially submerged temple offer great opportunities for exploration and photography. The ghat’s historical structures and the scenic views of the Ganges are truly photogenic.\n- **Boat Rides:** Boat rides from Scindia Ghat provide a different perspective of the river and the ghats, especially during sunrise and sunset. The sight of the tilted temple from the boat is particularly striking.\n- **Spiritual Reflection:** The quieter environment makes it an ideal spot for meditation and reflection. The mystical atmosphere adds to the spiritual experience.\n\n**Cleanliness and Facilities:**\nScindia Ghat is relatively clean, though, like many places in Varanasi, it faces challenges due to the high foot traffic and religious activities. Efforts are made by local authorities and communities to maintain cleanliness. Basic amenities like restrooms and small eateries are available nearby.\n\n**Safety:**\nThe ghat is generally safe for visitors. The area is frequented by locals and tourists alike, creating a sense of security. However, as with any crowded place, it's advisable to keep an eye on personal belongings and be cautious, especially during peak hours.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nScindia Ghat is a must-visit for those interested in history, mythology, and the mystical aspects of Varanasi. Its unique features, such as the partially submerged Shiva temple and its serene environment, make it stand out among the many ghats of Varanasi. Whether you are a spiritual seeker, a history enthusiast, or a curious traveler, Scindia Ghat offers a rich and captivating experience.\n\n**Pro Tips:**\n1. Visit during the early morning or late afternoon to enjoy the serene atmosphere and avoid the midday heat.\n2. Take a boat ride for a unique view of the ghat and the sunken temple.\n3. Bring a camera to capture the mystical and historical elements of the ghat.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\nMy visit to Scindia Ghat was a highlight of my trip to Varanasi. The combination of historical intrigue, spiritual significance, and serene beauty makes it a place worth visiting. Scindia Ghat offers a glimpse into the mystical side of Varanasi, making it a memorable and enriching experience."

The story behind its submersion is an extremely fascinating one. To its north side lies the Manikarnika Ghat while the other popular ghat in Varanasi, Dashashwamedh Ghat lies at a distance of 1.2 km approx. from it.  The temple which remains partially submerged in the River Ganga is known as the Ratneshwar Shiva Temple, or simply, leaning Shiva Temple. It is believed that the temple was submerged almost 150 years because it was unable to bear the weight of the ghat. People believe that it has been drowning ever since and there will come a time when it will be completely submerged. There is also a mythological tale behind the temple’s submergence.\nAccording to the tale, a boy by the name of Man Singh had a mother who was in love with a man, and wanted to marry him. The boy disapproved of this relationship and wanted to clear whatever debt he felt he owed his mother. Once he had done this, he thought, he would cut all ties with her. The mother was unwilling to bring the relationship to an end from her side and asked him to do that instead. With that objective in mind, he arrived at Kashi and built a temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. By doing so, he felt he had paid off any debt he owed his mother. Upon visiting the temple, however, his mother was enraged and said that nothing could pay off a mother’s love towards her child. Since then, the temple was cursed and remained submerged under water. During summers though, when the waters of River Ganga subside a little, the garbagriha (sanctum sanctorum) of the temple is visible, thus becoming a special attraction for devotees."

Out of the 84 ghats situated in Varanasi , few boast of architectural marvels as well and this is one such ghat.\n\nRight on the banks of this ghat is an old & beautiful Chet Singh fort. Fort is testament to one the fierce battles fought by Hindu rulers against the British empire. Though the kind was defeated but it does talk about his courage and valor.\n\nFort was built somewhere in 18th century and is one of the best locations for a photoshoot. You can see pre wedding shoots happening here.\n\nThis ghat is not over crowded. And you might even find it empty in early mornings. So if you are interested in a photoshoot, plan your visit early in the day.\n\nDefinitely a must visit ghat in Varanasi for its location and beautiful fort."

The ghat is named after Maharaja Chet Singh, who once ruled Varanasi and fought against the British during the 18th century. The fort at the ghat adds to its historical charm, though it remains largely abandoned.\n\nPros:\n\n✔ Scenic Beauty – Offers a mesmerizing view of the Ganges, especially during sunrise and sunset.\n✔ Less Crowded – Compared to Dashashwamedh Ghat, it is relatively peaceful, making it ideal for those seeking solitude.\n✔ Historical Significance – The fort and its battle history make it a point of interest for history lovers.\n✔ Good for Photography – The architecture, riverfront, and serene ambiance make it a great spot for photographers.\n\nCons:\n\n❌ Limited Accessibility – Fewer boats stop here, and the pathways are not well-maintained.\n❌ Not Very Clean – While it’s better than some ghats, cleanliness can still be improved.\n❌ Lack of Facilities – Few shops and amenities are available nearby compared to other famous ghats.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nChet Singh Ghat is a great spot for those looking to explore the lesser-known yet historically rich parts of Varanasi. It’s an ideal place for photography, meditation, and enjoying the tranquility of the Ganges. If you love history and peaceful surroundings, it’s worth a visit. However, better maintenance and facilities would enhance the experience.\n\nWould you like any modifications based on your experience?"

The ghat offers stunning views of the Ganges River and the city's vibrant spiritual atmosphere. It's a great spot to watch the sunrise or sunset, and the adjacent temples and shops add to the area's charm. However, it can get quite crowded and noisy at times, which might detract from the experience. Nevertheless, it's a great place to soak in the local culture and spirituality, and I highly recommend visiting Chet Singh Ghat during your trip to Varanasi."

              "reviewText": "Don't miss Sarnath if you are visiting Varanasi. It's a major Buddhist archaelogical site (monasteries ruins, Buddhist temple, etc.) that has now developed into a major Buddhist pilgrimage site. There's a lot to see, and if you are an archaeology or Buddhist history enthusiast and have got the time, it's worth a day of exploration. Let me summarize what you can explore here, along with some suggestions:\n\n1) Dhamek Stupa: It's a huge ancient (5th AD) stupa as you can see in the photos, and the main attraction of Sarnath complex. Trust me, it's something, with intricate carvings and strange ancient writings (Brahmi) on its circular wall.\n\n2) Monastery ruins: There are ancient monastery ruins which have been excavated from ground over the century (first by British, then by Indian government). I am not very familiar with the details, but there are some important artifacts and features like Ashokan pillars etc. (on the pillar ruins, there are writings in an ancient Brahmi language).\n\n3) Buddhist Museum: Many important items that have been excavated from the site are stored in this Museum. A must-see place.\n\n4) There are many more noteworthy places to visit nearby,. This includes a very large and beautiful Japanese temple with a sleeping Buddha, a Myanmar-style pagoda, a huge standing Buddha statue inside a Thai monastery complex, Sarnath Buddhist temple, and many more monasteries (we had to miss few due to time constraints, especially as we had seen lots and lots of monasteries in Bodh Gaya 2 years back).\n\n5) International crowd: You will see lots of international tourists here, especially groups from South East Asia and Far East. You will even see entire groups from those Buddhist nations meditating and chanting on the lawns near the monastery ruins. Offers a great peek into Buddhist culture.\n\n6) Neat and well-managed: The entire Sarnath complex is very neat and well-managed. You have ticket counters, online ticket option, wheelchairs, refreshment centers, shopping stalls at the entrance, and so on.\n\nSuggestion: Get tickets online (both Museum & Dhamek Stupa) before visiting as the queue can be quite long at the ticket counter. Also photography is allowed here, so you can take your electronic items with you."

The site holds deep historical and spiritual significance, as it’s believed to be where the Buddha gave his first sermon after enlightenment.\nThe stupa itself is massive and beautifully built, surrounded by well-maintained gardens and other ruins that give you a sense of the area’s importance in ancient times.\nThere’s a quiet, reflective atmosphere, and I’d recommend taking time to walk around slowly and take it all in.\nIf possible, visiting with a guide or reading up a bit beforehand adds a lot to the experience. Definitely worth a visit if you’re in Sarnath or nearby Varanasi."

Each sip feels like a dessert in itself — refreshing, satisfying, and utterly addictive.\n\nThe shop is located very close to Manikarnika Ghat, but do keep in mind that space is extremely limited — there’s barely enough room to stand properly, let alone sit comfortably. If you’re lucky, you might manage to grab a spot inside; otherwise, you’ll likely find yourself standing outside, soaking in the atmosphere as you enjoy your lassi.\n\nNo matter which flavor you choose, you really can’t go wrong — each one is better than the last and, in my opinion, far superior to the other lassis I tasted elsewhere in Varanasi. This place is truly a hidden gem and an absolute must-try for anyone visiting the city."

So one things for sure they don't offer varieties of lassi all the time.\nOn the wall of lassi shop pics of many tourist are pasted.\nWhat the surprising part is that they don't show the menu.\nIt was mention Rs 40 for lassi. They charge Rs 50. It's their starting range.\nVery frankly in Varanasi one can find better lassi then this in same price.\nThis place is overhyped.\nNeither ambience is good nor there service.\nIn fact there is no parking place.\nMy final recommendation there are better option are available in varanasi."

With its rustic walls, scribbled messages from global tourists, and a reputation that precedes it\n\nBut I left disappointed when it comes to the actual lassi experience.\n\nFirstly, there's no option for a regular, plain lassi— The menu is packed with flavoured options only, which might appeal to some, but not everyone is looking for a fruity or overly sweet twist.\n\nTo make things worse, the lassi was served warm, which completely threw off the experience for me. A lassi is meant to be cold, refreshing, and soothing—especially in the Indian heat—and this just didn’t deliver.\n\nWhile I can appreciate the shop’s legacy and its aesthetic, I personally found the hype to be far greater than the taste. If you’re a fan of traditional, simple, chilled lassi, this may not be the place for you.\n\nRating: ⭐⭐ (2/5)\nGreat ambience and vibe, but the lassi missed the mark."

While I didn't get to try their plain lassi, I can recommend the rabri lassi—it's a delicious and rich alternative. What is interesting in this place are the walls that are covered with photos of customers from all over the world, creating a fascinating tapestry of global travelers who have passed through its doors. This makes it more than just a place to grab a drink—it's a cultural experience and a must-visit for its historical and social charm.\n\nPrice of rabri lassi is 50 rupees at the time of writing."

Located near the famous Sarnath, this temple stands out not just for its unique Tibetan architecture, but also for the peaceful atmosphere that surrounds it. It’s the perfect place for anyone looking to experience Buddhist culture, history, and spirituality all in one spot.\n\nAs soon as you enter the temple grounds, you’re greeted by a sense of calm that’s rare to find in a busy city like Varanasi.

The bright colors, intricate wood carvings, and Tibetan symbols give the place a unique charm. The prayer wheels lined up outside the temple are a special feature – spinning them while walking along the path is a simple yet meaningful ritual, believed to spread positive energy.\n\nInside the temple, there’s a beautiful statue of Lord Buddha, along with stunning Tibetan-style paintings and thangka art that depict scenes from Buddha’s life and teachings. The whole temple reflects the rich culture and artistry of Tibet, making it not just a religious place but also a cultural treasure.\n\nThe temple and its surrounding garden are very well-maintained. The pathways are clean, the gardens are full of greenery, and the temple itself is spotless. It’s clear that the caretakers take pride in keeping the temple welcoming for visitors.\n\nThe monks and staff at the temple are very friendly and happy to share stories about the temple’s history, its connection to Tibetan culture, and the meaning behind different symbols and rituals. Their warmth and willingness to share knowledge make the visit even more meaningful.\n\nThe Tibetan Temple in Varanasi is a hidden gem that offers a beautiful blend of culture, spirituality, and peacefulness. Whether you are visiting Sarnath, exploring Varanasi, or simply want to experience something unique, this temple is absolutely worth your time.\n\nI would highly recommend for its beauty, tranquility, and cultural value."

The entrance of the temple is guarded and beautifully adorned with intricate carvings of two lions. Constructed in a traditional Tibetan architectural design, the temple houses a statue of Buddha in resting position. The temple is also decorated with Tibetan Buddhist paintings on the walls and ceilings.\nLike most Buddhist temples, here also one can find a series of prayer wheels that release paper scrolls with chants written on them when one rotates them in the clockwise direction. We had a peaceful visit as the temple was thinly crowded, when we toured. In short, Tibetan Temple is one of the must-visit places in Sarnath as the place offers a true essence of spirituality and tranquility.\nThe presence of Buddhist monks and the sound of chanting and prayer bells add to the temple's sacred atmosphere. The Tibetan Temple is a reminder of the Buddhist teachings of compassion and mindfulness, making it a cherished spot for pilgrims and tourists seeking solace and spiritual insight."

Built by Queen Ahilyabai Holkar of Indore, the ghat is clean and less crowded compared to some others nearby. Steps lead gently down to the river, where people sit peacefully, offering prayers or enjoying the gentle breeze. The ghat is also a common place for morning rituals and holy dips. A few temples near the ghat add to its spiritual feel, and the stone structures reflect a touch of history. It feels more personal and reflective, with less noise and chaos. Boats pass by slowly, giving lovely views of the river and the surrounding ghats. It’s a place where silence speaks, and the calm waters reflect the deep devotion of those who visit."

The ancient steps leading down to the river offer a glimpse into the city's rich past. While the water at the ghat can be a bit murky, there’s a unique solution that adds to the adventure: take a boat ride across the river!\n\nCrossing the Ganges by boat not only provides a refreshing change but also offers stunning panoramic views of Varanasi's ghats and temples from the water. Once you reach the other side, you can enjoy a revitalizing bath in cleaner waters, surrounded by the serene landscape and the iconic skyline of the city.\n\nAhilyabai Ghat is a must-visit for anyone looking to experience the essence of Varanasi, and the boat ride adds an unforgettable twist to your journey. Just be prepared to take that extra step for a truly rewarding experience!"

Also one can have boat rides from here hassle free, usually charged around 200₹ per person to go into the Ganges for a round. And 1500₹ if you want a private ride to the ghats of Varanasi. Also “ Pandits “ can be found here for anyone who wants to do “karma” for those who passed away."

What makes it stand out is the stunning architecture of the old Darbhanga Palace (now part of the BrijRama Palace hotel) that rises right beside the ghat. The grand structure, with its royal design and intricate stonework, gives the ghat a regal charm and makes it one of the most photogenic spots along the Ganga.\n\nThe ghat itself is peaceful compared to some of the busier ones, which makes it a perfect place to sit quietly, watch the river flow, and soak in the spiritual atmosphere. In the morning, the view of the sunrise from Darbhanga Ghat is absolutely mesmerizing, while in the evening you can witness the beautiful Ganga aarti at the nearby Dashashwamedh Ghat.\n\nIt’s also a great spot for photography, boating, and simply enjoying the heritage and culture of Varanasi. Walking along the steps and seeing the grand palace up close feels like stepping back in time.\n\nOverall, Darbhanga Ghat is a must-visit if you want to experience a mix of history, architecture, and serenity in Varanasi.* 🌅🏰✨"

I went there seeking a sense of calm, and I found it by taking a holy Ganga snan (bath) at the ghat. The early morning dip in the river, surrounded by the serene atmosphere, was refreshing and spiritually uplifting. The view of the ancient city along the banks was stunning, and it felt like a step back in time.\n\nAfter the Ganga snan, I visited the famous Kaashi Vishwanath Temple, which is a must-see for anyone visiting Varanasi. The temple's spirituality, combined with the lively surroundings, made it a unique experience. In the evening, I was fortunate to witness the mesmerizing Ganga Aarti—a captivating ceremony filled with chants, lights, and devotion. It’s an experience that truly captures the spirit of Varanasi.\n\nThe fun continued into the night as I explored the streets with friends, enjoying the vibrant night vibes of the city. Varanasi's street food is delicious, and I tried a variety of local delicacies, each bursting with flavor. The bustling lanes, with their night-time energy, were full of charm and excitement.\n\nOverall, Darbhanga Ghat and the surrounding areas offer a perfect blend of peace, spirituality, and fun, making it an unforgettable visit for anyone looking to experience the essence of Varanasi."

For a truly serene experience, I recommend visiting between 3-5 pm in the afternoon and after 11 pm in the evening.\n\nDuring these hours, the ghat exudes a peaceful ambiance, allowing visitors to unwind and rejuvenate their minds. Simply sitting by the ghat, observing the ebb and flow of life along the river, can be a deeply calming experience.\n\nWhether it's the gentle lapping of the water against the steps or the soft murmurs of conversations echoing in the distance, Darbhanga Ghat offers a respite from the hustle and bustle of the city. Take a moment to breathe, to observe, and to let your mind relax in the soothing embrace of this tranquil haven."

The total distance is about 6 km, which is quite doable. I did this in the late afternoon, but I guess it would be more pleasant if done early in the morning.\nOn many 'Ghats', you will find umpteen numbers of people taking 'holy' baths in the Ganges. So carry your bathing gear, just in case you also feel like taking a dip 😉.\nOf course, if you want to witness the 'Ganga Aarti', then the boat ride or walking has to be done in the evening."

I would strongly recommend that you reach Assi Ghat by 5 am, enjoy the wonderful Ganga Aarti and then catch the shared boat at about 5:45 am. This boat will charge you Rs 50/100 per person, and offer the most amazing views of the ghats while you watch sunrise,Subah-e-Banaras, in parallel.This boat tour is combination of a boat ride and a walking tour of the southern part of the old city to explore the cultural diversity of Varanasi along with the oldest alive site in the whole Varanasi and a ‘Akhaada’ !!"

It was built by Raja Man Singh of Amer in the 16th century, and the palace that stands on it is a beautiful example of Rajput-Mughal architecture. The ghat itself, with its broad stone steps, offers a tranquil space for pilgrims and visitors to connect with the holy Ganges River.\n​The site is also a place of great scientific importance. Perched on top of the palace is an astronomical observatory, which was constructed by Raja Jai Singh II, a descendant of Raja Man Singh. This observatory, often referred to as Jantar Mantar, houses various masonry instruments designed to measure time and study celestial bodies.\n​The Man Mandir Palace and its ghat are a visual spectacle, especially at night when the stone facade is illuminated, reflecting a serene glow on the river. The intricately carved windows and balconies, or jharokhas, add to the architectural grandeur. A stroll here provides a peaceful escape from the bustle of the city.\n​In conclusion, Man Mandir Ghat is more than just a place for ritual bathing. It's a blend of spiritual devotion, architectural excellence, and scientific history. The palace and observatory stand as silent witnesses to centuries of tradition and innovation, making it a truly unique and enriching destination."

Built in the early 17th century by Raja Man Singh of Amber, this ghat is not only a place of devotion but also a testament to the architectural and intellectual pursuits of its time. Its sandstone façade, adorned with delicate carvings and arched balconies, reflects the elegance of Rajput and Mughal styles, offering a visual treat to those who appreciate historical depth.\n\nWhat truly sets Man Mandir Ghat apart is the presence of the Man Mandir Observatory, perched atop the adjoining palace. This ancient astronomical center, equipped with instruments like sundials and celestial trackers, was once used to study the movements of stars and planets. It adds a fascinating scientific layer to the spiritual atmosphere, reminding visitors that Varanasi has long been a cradle of both faith and knowledge.\n\nThe ghat itself is serene and less crowded than its more famous neighbors, making it an ideal spot for quiet reflection. Pilgrims come here to perform rituals and offer prayers to the Ganga, while travelers often pause to admire the panoramic views of the river and the city’s skyline. The nearby temples—such as Rameshwara and Someshwara—add to the sacred ambiance, creating a space where devotion and history coexist in harmony.\n\nMan Mandir Ghat is a place where time seems to slow down. Whether you're watching the sunrise shimmer on the water, listening to the soft murmur of prayers, or exploring the observatory’s ancient instruments, the experience is both grounding and uplifting. It invites you to see Varanasi not just as a city of temples, but as a living museum of India’s spiritual and intellectual legacy."

The palace exhibits a blend of Mughal and Rajput architectural styles, with its intricate carvings, expansive balconies, and ornate windows.

Devotees do 'Kartik Snana' (holy dip) in the Ganges, light earthen lamps and pray to Lord Vishnu and Lord Shiva. This year, however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic 'Kartik Snana' will not be allowed in the Ganges in Haridwar, where lakhs of devotees from different parts of the country converge on Kartik Purnima. The ritual of 'Kartik Snana' is very significant for devotees.\nDev Diwali 2020 Date and Muhurat\nSunday, November 29Pradoshakal Dev Deepavali Muhurat - 5:08 pm to 7:47 pmPurnima Tithi begins at 12:47 pmPurnima Tithi ends at 2:59 pm on November.\n\"\"The Gods in the heaven celebrated Dev Deepawali on the Purnima Tithi of Kartik Shukla Paksha. And by doing so, they rejoiced the triumph of Lord Shiva over three demons named Tarakaksha, Kamalaksha and Vidyunmali. The three demons had created havoc and had disrupted the peace. Therefore, to restore Dharma and sanctity, Lord Shiva eliminated them with one arrow. This day is also known as Tripurari Purnima because Lord Shiva took the avatar of Tripurari to put an end to their tyranny. And to spread the message of peace and divinity, share the Happy Dev Deepawali images, wishes, quotes, status messages and greetings below with your loved ones\"\""

              "reviewText": "(Translated by Google) There is also Nandeshwar Ghat dedicated to Nandi, the vehicle of Lord Shiva. However, there are different beliefs regarding this. Some call it Nandeshwar Ghat and some recognize it as Nandishwar Ghat.\nIn the year 1940, Dwarikanath Chakraborty of Bhawanipur, Bengal got some major parts of the ghat concretely constructed and also built a huge building on the ghat bank. Nandishwar Shiva temple is established on the bank of the ghat itself, due to which it is believed that the ghat was named. The first mention about the ghat has been made by Motichandra in the book named 'Banaras and its Ghats'. At present the ghat is concrete and strong and mostly local people take bath here. In 1988, the Irrigation Department, with the help of the State Government, got the remaining unpaved part paved and the paved part repaired. This ghat also takes part in various events related to Ganga.\n\n(Original)\nभगवान शिव के वाहन नंदी को समर्पित नंदेश्वर घाट भी है। हालांकि इसको लेकर मान्यता अलग अलग भी है। कुछ इसे नंदेश्वर घाट कहते हैं तो कुछ इसे नन्दीश्वर घाट के रूप में पहचानते हैं।\nवर्ष 1940 में भवानीपुर, बंगाल के द्वारिकानाथ चक्रवर्ती ने घाट के कुछ प्रमुख हिस्सों का पक्का निर्माण कराया एवं घाट तट पर एक विशाल भवन भी बनवाया था। घाट तट पर ही नन्दीश्वर शिव मंदिर स्थापित है जिसके कारण मान्यता है कि घाट का नामकरण भी हुआ। घाट के संदर्भ में पहला उल्लेख मोतीचन्द्र ने 'बनारस एण्ड इट्स घाट' नाम पुस्तक में किया है। वर्तमान में घाट पक्का एवं सुदृढ़ है साथ ही यहा अधिकतर स्थानीय लोग ही स्नान करते हैं। सन् 1988 में राज्य सरकार के सहयोग से सिंचाई विभाग ने शेष कच्चे भाग का पक्का निर्माण एवं पक्के भाग का मरम्मत कराया था। गंगा से जुड़े विविध आयोजनों में यह घाट भी हिस्सा बनता है।"

But it has the most peaceful ambience and the most stunning Buddha! The google location takes u on the same lane but maybe a lil further ahead depending on which side you coming from coz you can keep going on this road and come out either near the Sarnath museum side or the Chinese temple side but it’s one simple way, recommend taking a vehicle for to and fro"

Its walls are adorned with intricate carvings of humans, birds, and ancient Brahmi script.\n\nExploring the ruins around the stupa offers a glimpse into the rich history of Sarnath. You can see remnants of ancient monasteries, monolithic railings, and the site of the Dhammarajika Stupa, which was unfortunately destroyed in the 18th century.\n\nThe ASI   has meticulously excavated the site, uncovering numerous inscriptions and artifacts, many of which are now on display in the museum opposite to the stupa complex.\n\nThe surrounding area is beautifully landscaped with lush greenery, providing a serene and peaceful atmosphere.\n\nDon't forget to visit the Sarnath Deer Park nearby. The name \"Sarnath\" itself has a fascinating origin. It comes from \"Sārangnāth,\" meaning \"Lord of the Deer,\" referring to an ancient legend where the Buddha, in a past life, sacrificed himself to save a deer. This act of compassion inspired the king to create the park as a safe haven for these animals.\n\nThe Dhamekh Stupa is a must-visit for anyone interested in Buddhism and Indian history. It's a place where you can connect with the past, feel the spiritual energy of the site, and gain a deeper understanding of Buddha's teachings."

They added such a refreshing vibe to the entire experience. Watching them swim calmly felt meditative in itself.\n\n🤝 The locals and staff are friendly and humble, always ready to help with a warm smile. It’s not just a place — it’s an experience of kindness and spiritual simplicity.\n\nIf you're looking to escape noise and find inner peace, Sarnath is the place.

Nestled right on the Ghats with a serene view of the Ganges, the atmosphere here is both peaceful and vibrant a perfect blend of traditional charm and relaxed cafe vibes.\nWhile their pizzas are quite popular, the real standout for me was their Apple pie with vanilla ice cream. It's honesty one of the best I've ever had. The pie is freshly baked with a butterly, flaky crustand warm spiced apples that taste homemade and comforting. Paired with a generous scoop of smooth vanilla ice cream, it's a dessert that hits every note: warm, cold, sweet and slightly tart.\nNote- The waiting time is a lot(20-30min)  so be prepared for that.\nOverall 5/5 for everything\nHighly recommend- especially for dessert lovers ❤️"

The second time too, same story, after which we dropped the idea of having apple pie altogether. The whatever little portion we had before the hair, tasted delicious though. Finding a seat during peak hours can be difficult, but we didn't have to wait long as two sweet English ladies agreed to share their table with us."

              "reviewText": "Nestled along Assi Ghat, Pizzeria Vatika Café is a place where time slows down, the Ganga shimmers just steps away, and food feels like comfort.\n\nWhat sets it apart in the bustle of Banaras is its serene, almost European charm that feels perfectly at home. In the mornings, as the staff readies for the day, the aroma of their legendary apple pie drifts from the oven. Golden, buttery, and flaky, it’s the kind of dessert that makes you smile before the first bite.\n\nBy evening, Vatika becomes a riverside trattoria. Thin-crust, wood-fired pizzas arrive fresh from the oven, simple and flavorful, never overdone. The handmade ravioli is delicate and rich, easily one of the best Italian dishes you’ll find in this corner of India. And yet, with every bite, Banaras lingers in the background: temple bells, the river glowing at sunset.\n\nThe atmosphere seals the experience with open seating, a gentle river breeze, and just enough distance from the main road to feel peaceful. Service is unhurried, since everything is made fresh, but that’s part of its charm. The manager and staff are warm and welcoming, making it feel less like a café and more like a home away from home.\n\nPizzeria Vatika Café isn’t about flashy flavors or dramatic presentation. It’s about balance: Italy by the ghat, with Banaras always humming in the background. A little oasis in a city that never stops moving.\n\nMust-tries: the signature apple pie, ravioli, and any of the wood-fired pizzas."

The open-air setting perched above the Ganges, warmed by the glow of the evening aarti, makes it a uniquely soothing spot  ￼.\n\n🍕 Pizza & Pasta\nThe thin-crust pizzas are wood-fired to perfection—light, crisp, and authentically Italian. I tried the Vaatika Special and Olive‑Jalapeño pizzas and loved how fresh and balanced the toppings tasted  ￼. Their pastas—both red sauce and white cream—come recommended; the white‑sauce penne is silky and veggie‑rich  ￼.\n\n🥧 Apple Pie\nThe apple pie with vanilla ice cream stole the show—warm, tender, melt-in-your-mouth goodness. Many visitors rave it’s among the best they’ve ever had  ￼.\n\n💁 Service & Value\nService is friendly and relaxed, though peak times can bring slight delays. The open-air setting means occasional flies, especially in warmer months, but you’re paying for the vibe as much as the food. Prices are absolutely fair—around ₹500 for two ().\n\n🌿 Final Thoughts\nThis place isn’t just another pizzeria—it’s an experience. Enjoying a wood-fired pizza and warm apple pie while gazing over the Ganges at sunset is simply magical. Ideal for travelers and locals alike looking for a calm, romantic, and delicious dining break along the ghats.\n\n⸻\n\nTips:\n•\tGo during the aarti for extra charm\n•\tAsk for the apple pie – you can’t miss it\n•\tIf you’re in a rush, maybe skip peak crowd times\n\nWould definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Varanasi who wants a laid-back, memorable Italian meal by the river."

Bistro will give you a feel that you are on holidays. The waiters are quick to respond to and will assist you with the menu which is diverse basically in Continental and Italian. We ordered mushroom chilli, cheese nachos and a pizza. Mushroom chilli was a little bit on the spicy side and nachos were really amazing with a variety of sauce to eat with. The pizza arrived in the end and had a crispy base with fresh toppings. The prices are affordable and the ambience is amzingly bright, with lower volume music playing in the background. Ut is definetly a good place to hand around in the evening."

I had received a 13 ear anniversary coupon from the restaurant itself and I informed the server to redeem at the time of placing order. After that my order was delayed for a long time and when it came the server just went without even an attempt to serve. While he was serving the other customers. On pointing it out that if you add service charge on your bill ,u are supposed to serve also he was unapologetically rude. Pathetic experience. I don't think I want to eat here again if this is the service provided"

Nearly as good as from a serious Melbourne barista!\nIf you are in need of a decent caffeine fix, come and support this little institution. You'll feel good in more ways than you expect\nHaving recently retired from 30 years in hospitality, I can recommend Cafebility completely!\nMaybe just remember that it is a learning environment too, so a little patience may be needed..   😌"

The place was completely empty the entire time. It was scorching heat but they hadn’t even turned on the air conditioning. After about an hour, without any crowd or rush, I was asked to leave for not placing an additional order.\n\nWhile I understand cafes may have policies, the approach felt unwelcoming, especially considering I was a paying customer and wasn’t occupying space during peak hours. Would have appreciated a bit more hospitality and flexibility. Unfortunately, not a place I’d return to."

Services are little slow but that's ok. You can use this time for calm your mind and for stability and for use your phone or look around to see the beauty of this place. Overall a good experience.
