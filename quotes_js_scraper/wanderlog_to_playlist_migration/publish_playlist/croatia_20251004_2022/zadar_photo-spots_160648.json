You'll find yourself captivated by the silhouette of boats gently bobbing on the sea, adding to the picturesque scene. The magic truly comes alive as dusk settles in, and the Sea Organ begins its melodic performance, creating an ethereal soundtrack that perfectly complements the visual spectacle. And then there are the lights of the Greeting to the Sun itself – their simplicity is their genius, creating an interactive and enchanting display of the ground that is both playful and profound.

This stunning installation, located right by the sea next to the famous Sea Organ, is an incredible blend of art, science, and nature. During the day, the large circular platform quietly absorbs sunlight, but as soon as the sun sets, it lights up with vibrant, colorful patterns powered by solar energy. It feels like the ground itself is alive with energy!\n\nWhat I loved most was how the installation connects you to the cosmos - with a solar calendar engraved on the ring and smaller discs representing the planets nearby. It's not just beautiful but also educational. The nearby Sea Organ adds a magical soundtrack as the waves create peaceful, melodic sounds, making the whole experience truly multi-sensory.\n\nThe location is perfect for an evening stroll along the waterfront, watching the sunset while enjoying this unique light show. Best of all, it's completely free and open at all times. I highly recommend visiting just before dusk to catch the full effect.

My point being, the packed earth was revoltingly covered in cigarette butts, I've never in my life seen so many in one place. More bins definitely need to be provided, but  until that happens, bring your rubbish away with you cigarette butts are definitely rubbish, put them in a bottle or something until you are leaving and bring them with you.

The walkway stretches from the university buildings (which are very pretty) to the sea organ. It has a great atmosphere and also a playground for kids.

Nearby, there's a shady park and a picturesque bay offering cruises for diving or sunset views. The gate was a crucial part of the city's defense during the Venetian Republic era and symbolizes its rich cultural heritage. Highly recommended!",
