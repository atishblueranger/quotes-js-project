It's quite steep to get to with a 5 minute walk down various stairs from the top of old town but well worth it. Lovely azure water, sunbeds that you can rent for €25 each (all come with umbrellas), a bar and restaurant and good music beach played throughout. It looks crowded but plenty of space for everyone.

Sunbeds were nice and comfy and 25 euros each for the day (15 extra for an umbrella) which didn't feel too bad. After spending lots of days swimming in more quiet spots straight off the rocks (as we don't like loud busy beaches), this delivered a nice change in scene. The beach was busy by midday but not so much that it ruined the relaxed atmosphere, and the size of it feels very intimate, with the palm fronded beach bar giving it an almost tropical feel. The beach bar does great burgers and various other bar snacks such as fried fish and calamari and salads, although the salads looked a little basic. There is also one proper beach restaurant on the other side of the beach. The water was very calm too. If you're looking for a proper beach day with all the works but without the obnoxiously loud music and crowds, this is the perfect spot!",

Service was amazing, The staff in both the restaurant and on the beach is super friendly and helpful. The restaurant offers amazing food and refreshing drinks with table service by the sunbeds. Small pebble stones and a little plateau from where you can jump makes the beach a perfect place for all ages (we were there with 2 small kids). We enjoyed it several days in a row and can't wait to come back🏖️☀️❤️",

We were greeted immediately and sat at table close to the beach so our daughter could enjoy the beach while we dined. Our server Milan was gracious. He made us feel so welcomed. I had the sea bass, my husband had the burger. It was all so delicious. Thank you Milan for your hospitality.",
