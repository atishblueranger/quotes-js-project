Margarita and mushroom pizza were both tasty, but for me, Tartufizza (with mushrooms) has too intense flavor, mostly because of the cheese with truffle. Therefore, I can't say that the pizza was exceptionally delicious, at least for us. However we really liked the package.\nWhat about service? There are no cons. The waitress was lovely, and we didn't wait long. It took approximately 10 minutes for our order to be done. Additionally, the whole atmosphere was pleasant. Everything looked clean, and people were friendly.",

The tomato sauce was kind of thick but had the taste of a spice I was not expecting on pizza, might have been fresh oregano and the cheese had no taste at all.\n\nThe restaurant has a bar atmosphere with loud music and loud conversations.\n\nOverall, not bad pizza but not traditional flavors at all.",

The staff are genuinely friendly and impressively efficient, keeping the energy upbeat and the service smooth.\n\nThe pizza looks great: thick, charred crust with quality toppings like black olives, capers, and anchovies. Ingredients are fresh and well chosen. But structurally, it's a mixed bag. The edge is thick and almost deep-dish, while the center is thin and soggy from too much tomato sauce. It leans Neapolitan, but the balance is off.\n\nGreat for a fun night out with good vibes and solid service.",

There are only about 8 or 9 tables so recommend you come early as they are popular and they don't take reservations. Menu changes every day and they actively cross out items on the hand written menu as they run out of ingredients. Excellent fresh food they make right when you order. Very reasonable prices for the area and friendly and efficient staff.",

The spring roll was the only decent thing we had crispy, flavorful, and well done. Unfortunately, the soup was a complete letdown. It was bland and absolutely no richness or depth you'd expect from a restaurant charging these prices.\n\nFor mains, I had the squid ink risotto and my husband had the Angus beef. After our starters, we were left waiting almost 20 minutes for the mains. The risotto was dull, lacking any balance or seasoning, and had an unpleasant aftertaste. The Angus beef was chewy and poorly cooked, paired with mashed potatoes that were supposed to be elevated with truffle oil. As a country that actually produces truffles, this version was shockingly below standard flat, oily, and with none of the fragrant quality you'd expect.\n\nService made the experience even worse. We were given a completely different menu from another table, which left us questioning whether there was some form of bias or discrimination happening. And when we asked for the bill, a female server simply pointed her finger at my original (male) server, refusing to assist and continuing her personal chat instead. Completely unprofessional, dismissive, and unacceptable for a place that positions itself as “above average.”\n\nOverall: long waiting times, overpriced dishes, inconsistent menus, poor service, and food that is far below the mark in flavor and execution. One good spring roll can't save an otherwise awful dining experience.",

Made our visit very special.\n\nThe food was delicious and reasonably priced for a Michelin star restaurant. The carpaccio and smoked risotto were standouts. Atmosphere was very chill and romantic, with a lovely view of the sea. Was nice to also be a little outside of the busy old town area.\n\nOnly complaint is that the wines we were recommended, while very delicious, were also VERY expensive. Would have been nice to get a warning that we were about to drop 20 euros each on glasses of wine.\n\nAll in all, was a great experience and would definitely recommend it!",

The restaurant masterfully combines fresh, local ingredients with modern presentation and preparation, offering a culinary experience that feels both authentic and refined.\n\nWe were lucky to have Toni as our waiter – his warmth, attention to detail, and genuine passion for food and wine made our visit truly unforgettable. We couldn't decide on just one dish, so we ended up sharing everything – and it was the best decision we could've made!\n\nWe started with the Sea Selection, a beautifully arranged tasting of seven bite-sized seafood delights, followed by the Roasted Squid Salad – tender squid served over arugula with roasted nuts and capers, absolutely delicious.\n\nFor our mains, we shared the Sea Makaruni – technically an appetizer, but a must-try signature dish featuring hand-rolled makaruni in a rich cognac shrimp sauce – and a perfectly cooked sea bass fillet with toasted polenta, vegetable ragout, and broccoli purée.\n\nWe couldn't resist dessert either: a light citrus meringue with berries and a decadent chocolate cake that blew us away. Each course was paired with exquisite wines from Korčula, the owner's home island – a lovely personal touch.\n\nBut honestly, what makes Makarun truly special is the people. Toni's knowledge and enthusiasm elevated the entire visit. His recommendations, storytelling, and infectious love for great cuisine turned this meal into an experience we'll never forget.\n\nWe'll definitely be back next time we're in Split. Highly, highly recommended!",

It wasn't even on our radar until the person who checked us into our hotel recommended it when we asked for suggestions. I love the history behind the place, and how every makarun is handmade. Not only did I feel special eating each makarun, but it also tasted absolutely amazing! We were only in Split for a day, but I made sure to return here during our last few days in Croatia, even though it was out of our way. That's how good it was. Though a little pricey, it was worth it (for me at least). The desserts were phenomenal as well. I'll be dreaming of this restaurant until we come back to Croatia.",

The tuna tartare was one of the best we have experienced and the steaks were well seasoned and cooked to order.  We'll definitely come back here again when in the area.\nFinally, not sure on the comments that this place is expensive, and it really depends where you are traveling in from as we thought it was good value for money.  You would be paying waaay more for a similar dining experience of the same quality in California, Seattle, New York and London for example.",

My girls had the margerita pizza which they cleaned off quickly.\nService was lovely and they even kindly re-seated us outside once the rain had stopped at my request. Nothing seemed to be a bother and our waiter was fantastic. He filleted the fish in style and ensured we were comfortable.\nThe atmosphere in the square was truly lovely and lively, whilst not being too loud serving a pleasant environment to dine in.\nI would highly recommend a visit here!",

Also, the guy who picked us up in split was very kind and explained us a few things about the area while he was driving. We suggest taking the first slot in the morning or the last one of the day (less hot), there's not a lot of walking but very little shade so be prepared if you do this during the summer. We had a lot of fun !",

We had the best of the best of the Adriatic, we also had the fish soup which was delicious. It was a broth soup with a good chunk of white fish and capers. We also tried the super greens starter. It was fantastic.\n\nThe place is not great for Winter dining since it is in the port and relatively separated from the heart of the city. But you could tell that during the summer months when the boating season is live the terrace is very active and the view of the port of Split is fantastic.\n\nWe didn't have dessert, but the options looked really attractive.\n\nOverall, you can tell that this place is Michelin guide restaurant and it's well deserved.",

With all the amazing sights, i think the best part was the drive was actually the drive between cities. We jokingly said there should be an attraction “Kruno's Pitstops”. He took us to the best Cream cake! I highly recommend this company, and i seldom write reviews. Thanks also to the tour guides. All were pleasant and knowledgeable.Very enjoyable trip!",

As this was our first visit to the country, we sought the services of Croatia Private Tours to handle all our sightseeing and transportation. We opted for the 8 day Dubrovnik to Zagreb private tour with an optional excursion in the town of Ston for oyster farming and wine tasting. This optional activity was quite fun! Delicious, freshly shucked oysters straight from the Bay, yum!\n\nAll transportation provided was clean and comfortable. We had Kruno for the majority of the time, and he was not only always punctual and professional, but also personable and quite funny! Kruno's a great conversationalist and gave us wonderful insight on Croatian culture, food, and the people. We enjoyed Kruno!\n\nWe also had Mate as our driver from Split to Zagreb, and he too, was professional. We also enjoyed talking to Mate about his homeland.\n\nAll local guides provided in Dubrovnik, Split/Trogir, Island of Hvar, and Zagreb, were all extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and accommodating. We learned a lot!\n\nIf you want to travel to Croatia and have no idea where to begin your search, do not hesitate to reach out to Croatia Private Tours for all your traveling needs!",

The staff – at least the one who served us – was professional, well-trained, and contributed to a pleasant dining experience.\n\nWe ordered a whole fish for the family, and it was well-prepared and tasted very good. Even our youngest child enjoyed it. To accompany the meal, we ordered a bottle of wine from Skradin for €58, which unfortunately did not live up to our expectations.\n\nThe food and service were both good, and the atmosphere was elegant and relaxed. However, when compared to other restaurants in Split offering similar or even better food quality, the prices at Kadena felt significantly overpriced.\n\nWe were a family of four, and for one bottle of wine, one iced tea, and two bottles of water – along with the food – we paid €310. That is extremely expensive, especially for being in Split, where you can have excellent meals for far less.\n\nIf the prices had been more aligned with the overall experience, I would have gladly given 4 stars.
