You're watching this incredible light show right next to the Adriatic, with live waves crashing and the Sea Organ playing in the background. Magical.

Today, this is a popular tourist sight and, in a way, a gastronomic destination, because close to the square, you can find a few quality restaurants.",

Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the food. I mentioned to him that my friend is pregnant and he was fully aware of what pregnant women can eat and warned us that the desert/ tiramisu has raw eggs. He was lovely. The food was very good. We had a lovely time 👌We ordered bruschetta with meat as a starter. Tuna steak, Seafood pasta. They were serving Tiramisu as dessert. So nice. Small glass of wine, Miranda and 2 large bottles of wine. The bill came up to 80€ which was worth it. Portions were great. we couldn't finish the mains as we wanted to keep room for the dessert and we got the rest of the food to go.",

My point being, the packed earth was revoltingly covered in cigarette butts, I've never in my life seen so many in one place. More bins definitely need to be provided, but  until that happens, bring your rubbish away with you cigarette butts are definitely rubbish, put them in a bottle or something until you are leaving and bring them with you.

You'll find yourself captivated by the silhouette of boats gently bobbing on the sea, adding to the picturesque scene. The magic truly comes alive as dusk settles in, and the Sea Organ begins its melodic performance, creating an ethereal soundtrack that perfectly complements the visual spectacle. And then there are the lights of the Greeting to the Sun itself – their simplicity is their genius, creating an interactive and enchanting display of the ground that is both playful and profound.

This stunning installation, located right by the sea next to the famous Sea Organ, is an incredible blend of art, science, and nature. During the day, the large circular platform quietly absorbs sunlight, but as soon as the sun sets, it lights up with vibrant, colorful patterns powered by solar energy. It feels like the ground itself is alive with energy!\n\nWhat I loved most was how the installation connects you to the cosmos - with a solar calendar engraved on the ring and smaller discs representing the planets nearby. It's not just beautiful but also educational. The nearby Sea Organ adds a magical soundtrack as the waves create peaceful, melodic sounds, making the whole experience truly multi-sensory.\n\nThe location is perfect for an evening stroll along the waterfront, watching the sunset while enjoying this unique light show. Best of all, it's completely free and open at all times. I highly recommend visiting just before dusk to catch the full effect.

A lot of options for kids,  not too deep sea ( a little rocks in the sand), 9 pools (2 huge  sections for kids), rollercoaster and other activities, some activities during the day at the pool and at the evening also activities for kids. The umbrella and sunloungers are 7 euros per one, so it's 28 euros per day for one umbrella and 3 sunloungers. At the pool is the same. Half border is really nice options, only breakfast and dinner, no options to choose lunch, food was good, Ice cream shops everywhere, 2.5 euros per scoop,  bread store, fruit and vegetables store (really good one) about 5 restaurants around (not included in price) some gift stores. They do not provide beach towels. Mobile home is really tiny, but everything that you need, 2 units of conditioner. Everything is closed after 10-11pm. Nothing to do for adults after dinner. Kids everywhere.\nHorse riding, Jetskies, banana bout, some other water activities, and excursion not cheap.",

            "text": "Zaton Holiday Resort is a large complex with well-developed infrastructure, offering a wide range of activities for families with children. Evening events and animations are well-organized and definitely one of the highlights. The resort has shops, restaurants, and fairly well-maintained, spacious beaches. It's also a convenient base for exploring the surrounding area.\n\nUnfortunately, when it comes to the quality of accommodation and some facilities, the resort falls short – especially compared to similarly priced resorts in Istria. The mobile home we rented directly from the campsite was in poor condition: a damaged terrace, lack of cleanliness, insects, cobwebs, missing basic equipment (no dishwasher, not enough cutlery), and the air conditioning didn't work for two days.\n\nThe biggest disappointment, however, was the pool area. The pools were only open for 8 hours a day – from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. You were not allowed to bring your own accessories such as floats, strollers, umbrellas, or children's sun tents. The entire area around the pool was taken up by sun loungers, which could only be used for an extra fee – €28, regardless of whether you stayed for the whole day or just a few hours. There was absolutely no shade, which made staying at the pool uncomfortable unless you paid. Additionally, the jacuzzi-style pools – where bubbles or massage jets were supposed to work – were either not functioning or worked only occasionally.\n\nIn summary, Zaton Holiday Resort has potential and offers many activities, but it falls short when it comes to comfort and value for money. If you're considering staying here, it's worth checking the specific accommodation and conditions in detail, especially if you're expecting higher standards.",

Also we had a beef carpaccio that was very good prepared.\nMains\nWe ordered a lobster with homemade tagliatelle and pork medallions. Both of these dishes were outstandingly good.\nBut for that high quality restaurant the bread was disappointment, stale and dry. We know Croatia is great with bakeries and local pekarna, so we suggest improving the recipe or change the provider of bread, because for that super quality of food the bread should also keep the level.\nAll in all great restaurant, great experience, perfect service!

The replica of the larger Egyptian sphinx has faced neglect and vandalism throughout the years, but it’s still there as a symbol of everlasting love that overcomes all.",

All wine was very good, my favourite was white sparkling wine. We ended up buying few bottles for our friends. We enjoyed a lot, so instead of 20 min, we ended up staying there few hours!
