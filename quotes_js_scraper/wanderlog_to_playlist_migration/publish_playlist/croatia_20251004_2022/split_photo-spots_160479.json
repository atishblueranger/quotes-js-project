The bell at the top adds to its charm and history, and it's cool to imagine how much the area has changed since it was built.\n\nThough the climb can be a bit of a workout and you are not allowed to bring your water with you (they make you place it outside the steps before going in), the scenic views and the sense of history make it a highlight of the visit. Definitely don't skip it if you're in Split!",

The bus stop is a 10-minute walk from the beach.\nOne side is protected by nature, offering some shade, while the central area is completely open for sunbathing. Bring the essentials: water and food, snorkeling gear, shoes, and possibly a tent for sun protection.\nIn early September, it's not crowded, and the blue water temperature is perfect for bathing.\nThere's a small dog area on one side and a nudist area on the other.",
