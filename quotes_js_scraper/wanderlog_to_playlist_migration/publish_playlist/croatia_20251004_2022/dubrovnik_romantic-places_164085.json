However when we arrived we were advised that they were able to upgrade us to front row. The front row experience was amazing, the views incredible, especially at sunset. I was hoping the restaurant wouldn't be an overpriced touristy gimmick, but it certainly wasn't. While the food/ drink was expensive, it was worth it for the views, great servers and amazing food! This is a must do experience in Dubrovnik, there was even free DJ and face painting from 7pm right next to the restaurant and the cable car ride was pretty cool too!",

Nautika exceeded all our expectations - from the breathtaking views to the exceptional food and service.\n\nEvery dish was beautifully presented, and the quality was simply outstanding. The flavors, textures, and attention to detail were on par with - if not better than - several Michelin-starred restaurants we've tried around the world. And that says a lot, considering we're residents of the UAE and have experienced some top-tier dining.\n\nThe staff were not only professional and attentive, but also genuinely warm, friendly, and even a bit entertaining - which added a relaxed charm to the refined setting.\n\nThe view overlooking the Adriatic and the city walls made the evening even more magical. Without a doubt, one of the best dining experiences we've had - highly recommended for anyone visiting Dubrovnik.",

The food was truly excellent - each dish beautifully composed and full of flavour. The view alone is worth noting: a cinematic backdrop of a wooden sailboat gliding across the water, alpine swifts darting overhead, and a front-row seat to one of the most picturesque vistas in Dubrovnik.\n\nWe were fortunate to enjoy our table for a leisurely three hours, which allowed us to truly settle in and soak up the setting. The staff were warm, gracious, and professional throughout, and we appreciated the thoughtful touches like the complimentary dessert bites and a sweet pomegranate liqueur to end the meal.\n\nThat said, a few service details fell short of the fine dining standard one might expect at this price point. Our very kind sommelier seemed somewhat flustered - two of the wine pairings arrived mistimed, one after the dish and one well before. Our water glasses were left empty for long stretches early in the meal, and our napkins weren't refolded when we left the table. Small things, perhaps, but they add up in a place that markets itself on perfection.\n\nIn the end, we had a memorable evening, and the food was without fault. But with such a lofty reputation, I was hoping for just a bit more polish. Still, if you're looking for an unforgettable setting and exquisite flavours, Nautika offers both - just know that your expectations may need a touch of calibration.",

Especially when other restaurants in Dubrovnik have similar prices and are not nearly as good, this restaurant has great value for your money. The atmosphere of this restaurant was unreal.

They serve excellent specialty coffee, some of the best I've had in the area. The space is packed with all kinds of items, from souvenirs to local drinks, so it feels more like a trendy shop that also happens to make great coffee. Prices are a bit on the higher side, but the atmosphere is lively, touristy, and enjoyable. If you're in Old Town and looking for a quality caffeine fix, this place is worth a visit.",

Whether you grab a seat inside among curated souvenirs or bask in the morning air on the terrace, there's an easygoing charm to this place. Chill music drifts through the space, and the owner from Vancouver adds to the warm vibe, always greeting you with a smile.

Sunbeds were nice and comfy and 25 euros each for the day (15 extra for an umbrella) which didn't feel too bad. After spending lots of days swimming in more quiet spots straight off the rocks (as we don't like loud busy beaches), this delivered a nice change in scene. The beach was busy by midday but not so much that it ruined the relaxed atmosphere, and the size of it feels very intimate, with the palm fronded beach bar giving it an almost tropical feel. The beach bar does great burgers and various other bar snacks such as fried fish and calamari and salads, although the salads looked a little basic. There is also one proper beach restaurant on the other side of the beach. The water was very calm too. If you're looking for a proper beach day with all the works but without the obnoxiously loud music and crowds, this is the perfect spot!",

Staff were all so friendly and professional, the room (we stayed in 209) was fairly small but comfortable and had: a great bed, lovely bathroom, ample closet space, a Nespresso machine, a balcony with beautiful views. There's a modest gym and indoor pool. The terrace for cocktails was lovely and breakfast was really very good too. The beach was unexpectedly closed - which was a shame - when we visited. Overall a wonderful hotel that I'd love to return to.",

The hotel overlooks a beautiful secluded beach inlet, something you only see on tv or in a magazine. We stayed in 3 hotels during our honeymoon (all around the same price point) in Croatia and this was by far the best one. Everything we had at breakfast was delicious, and there were so many options. There must have been 4 or 5 types of honey, and a hot food menu where you could order something made fresh. Even the eggs were amazing, the best scrambled eggs I've ever had. There was no outdoor pool but we didn't mind, because we were busy walking around the old city and doing excursions all day, and the hotel has access to the sea below. The service was also great, they unexpectedly upgraded our room since we were on our honeymoon. The entire stay was incredible, I would stay there again in a heartbeat.",

For me though, I found it unusual and certainly unnecessary, especially considering your view out the balcony. The balcony was breath taking but did not have a handle to get back into the room,.... I felt bad smearing the spotless window each time I needed to get back into my room. On our departure, I found out that they are going to be doing some remodeling,.... My hope is that they ditch the TV altogether, or at least mount it to a wall, install bidets on the toilet, and they provide handles on the balcony.",

You can book tickets online (lokrum webshop)or just walk up to the old town pier(turning left from the supposedly beat gelato shop.\nTicket kiosk is on the right after the restaurant seating. The boat is brown and white called the zrinski.\nCarry some sandwiches and beer from the store before the entrance if you want or there are plenty of nice restaurants on the island.\nIt is a beautiful island with lots of trees and shade. Star attraction is the stunningly beautiful peacocks walking around and are comfortable in your presence.Dont feed them and dont touch them please.  You can check out the monastery(not functional) but you have a nice looking restaurant here and the iron throne where you can sit on and take pictures . A bit of a steep climb on a stony broken path to the right to the ruins of the small fort and nice views. Do check out the corner bench next to the exit with the best view. Then back down to the monastery( you can use the lavatory here if you want) towards the small water body where you can swim if you want. You can play volleyball and football as it has option for both and of course play zone for little kids.\nPlenty of areas on this island where you can go down the steps to the water.\nTook us some 4hrs back to the pier in dubrovnik.\nYou can take maybe 5-6hrs if you want to picnic sitting on the benches near the monastery or eat at the restaurants.\nWhile sitting on the benches peacocks do come looking for food but keep it high on the benches. Dont feed them.They just hover around and dont say anything.\nOverall keep this for the last day as a filler.",
