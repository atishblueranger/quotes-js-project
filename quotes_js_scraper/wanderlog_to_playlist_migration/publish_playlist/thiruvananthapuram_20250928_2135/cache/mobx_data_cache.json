Spread across a huge, well maintained space, the place is spotlessly clean and beautifully organized, offering a calm escape right in the city.\n\nThe museum itself is free to enter, while the adjoining zoo entry costs just ₹50, which also includes a locker facility for bags and even plastic bottles a thoughtful touch for keeping the space clean. The zoo is expansive, and right outside, a small café serves as the perfect refresher after a walk.\n\nWhat makes this venue special is the balance it offers: while the exhibits and zoo engage your curiosity, the grounds themselves invite you to slow down. There are plenty of shaded spots and tree-side seating areas, making it easy to pause, rest, or just take in the serene atmosphere. Despite the outside heat, the entire space feels naturally cooler, adding to the comfort.\n\nWhether you’re interested in history, looking to enjoy a day amidst nature, or simply searching for a peaceful retreat, Napier Museum is one of those rare places where you can do it all at once."

There is no dedicated parking space but you can park your vehicles near to this site. Safe swimming spaces are there in the lake.

Plastic bottles and food items are not allowed inside, For plastic bottles, a refundable deposit of 20 rupees is collected, which you can claim upon return. Drinking water refill points are available inside, and there’s a small shop for tea and snacks. Also a cloakroom is available at the entrance. A great place for families and kids. Worth the visit."

The zoo is beautifully maintained with a wide variety of animals, from majestic tigers to exotic birds, all kept in spacious and natural enclosures. The lush greenery and clean surroundings made the walk even more enjoyable. The museum was equally fascinating, offering a rich glimpse into Kerala’s cultural and historical heritage through its detailed exhibits and artifacts. The aquarium, though smaller, was well-organized and showcased a lovely collection of marine life. I was especially impressed by how educational yet entertaining the whole visit was. The place is perfect for families, students, and anyone who appreciates nature and history. I absolutely loved my time there and would highly recommend it to others visiting Thiruvananthapuram.\n\nThe ticket for the zoo and swara art gallery was 30-40 something .... and zoo and aquarium ticket was also separate....in total you will need to buy 3 tickets"

The moment I walked in, I was impressed by how green, peaceful, and clean the entire zoo is. The big trees gave plenty of shade, and the pathways were wide and well maintained, which made walking around very pleasant. It felt like stepping into a calm natural space right in the middle of the city.\n\nThe animals were the real highlight of today’s visit. I spent a lot of time watching the Royal Bengal Tigers and Asiatic Lions—both looked majestic and powerful, and it was amazing to see them so close. The giraffes were another star attraction, tall and graceful, and they caught everyone’s attention. I also enjoyed seeing the Indian One-Horned Rhinoceros, which is rare and exciting to witness in person. The zebras, with their unique stripes, were fascinating, and of course, the elephants were a joy to watch as always. The hippos relaxing in water and the graceful herds of deer added even more charm to the visit.\n\nThe bird section was full of life and color. Today I was especially amazed by the macaws, parrots, and hornbills—they were so vibrant and active. The peacocks were beautiful too, adding a touch of elegance to the aviary. I also walked through the reptile house, where I saw crocodiles, snakes, and other reptiles. It was both exciting and educational. Every enclosure felt thoughtfully designed, and I appreciated how natural the surroundings looked.\n\nAnother thing I noticed during today’s visit was how well the place is maintained. The enclosures were clean, the animals looked healthy, and the zoo staff clearly put effort into keeping the environment neat. There were enough resting spots and drinking water points, which made the visit comfortable even though I spent a good amount of time exploring. The ticket price was very affordable for the quality of the experience.\n\nAfter the zoo, I also took a quick look at the Natural History Museum and Sree Chitra Art Gallery nearby, which made the trip even more meaningful. Both are located right next to the zoo and add great value if you want to make it a complete day outing.\n\nOverall, today’s visit to Thiruvananthapuram Zoo was fantastic. It’s a place where you can relax, learn, and enjoy the beauty of nature and wildlife all at once. I left with great memories, and I would definitely recommend this zoo to anyone visiting Thiruvananthapuram. 🌿🦒🐅🦓🦜🐘"

In 1729, Marthanda Varma founded the princely state of Thiruvithamkoor and Thiruvananthapuram was made the capital in 1745 after shifting the capital from Padmanabhapuram in Tamil Nadu.[15] In the mid-19th century, the city was under the reign of Swathi Thirunal and Ayilyam Thirunal.

Also it is inside a building so he will be able to walk a lot without much crowd. We went on a Saturday and rainy day. There was very little crowd almost 20 people or so. He loved the exhibits especially the wild animals but was afraid of the skeletons. He ran a lot from one exhibit to another and would address most birds as crow. He knew lion tiger and giraffe from his soft toys. Everything except snake and giraffe are stuffed live animals. They have maintained it well. Really good and would suggest others to see it"

Located near the zoo and Napier Museum, it’s surrounded by trees and gardens that give a calm feeling even before you enter.\n\nInside, the museum is well-organised with separate sections for birds, mammals, reptiles, insects, fossils, and tribal life. You’ll see lifelike models of animals, skeletons, and preserved specimens displayed with proper descriptions. One of the most interesting parts is the fossil gallery, which includes ancient tree trunks and other rare finds.\n\nThe building itself has an old charm, and the exhibits are arranged in a way that makes it easy to walk through and learn. It’s a good place for kids and students, but adults who enjoy learning will also find it engaging. It usually takes around one to two hours to see everything.\n\nPhotography is not allowed inside, and there is no cafeteria, but the museum is clean and the staff are helpful. There’s also a small garden with dinosaur statues that adds a playful touch, especially for children.\n\nIf you enjoy learning about nature or want to spend a quiet and meaningful afternoon in the city, this is definitely a good place to visit."

As a history enthusiast, I was blown away by the vast collection of artifacts and exhibits that showcase the rich cultural and natural heritage of Kerala.\n\nFrom the moment I stepped inside, I was struck by the stunning architecture of the building itself, which is a beautiful blend of traditional and modern styles. The museum's layout is thoughtfully designed, making it easy to navigate and explore the various galleries.\n\nThe exhibits are incredibly well-curated, with detailed labels and descriptions that provide a wealth of information about each artifact. I was particularly fascinated by the ancient stone sculptures, bronze idols, and traditional Kerala murals on display. The museum's collection of tribal artifacts and traditional crafts was also impressive, offering a glimpse into the lives of Kerala's indigenous communities.\n\nWhat I appreciated most about this museum was the way it weaves together the natural and cultural history of the region. The exhibits on Kerala's flora and fauna, including the stunning taxidermy displays, were just as engaging as the historical and anthropological exhibits. It was amazing to see how the museum highlights the interconnectedness of human and natural history.\n\nThe staff were friendly and knowledgeable, and the museum's facilities were clean and well-maintained. Overall, I would highly recommend the Natural History Museum in Trivandrum to anyone interested in history, culture, or the natural world."

With over 150 rooms, it blends the simple elegance of Kerala architecture with hints of Dravidian influence and even touches of European design like tall steeples and a wooden lift  .\n\nSet on a small hillock and surrounded by lush greenery, the building stands out in the city, its six towers visible from afar  . It was built with respect to Vastu Shastra and oriented to welcome monsoon breezes, showing how practical design and beauty were both important  . Inside, long corridors and high ceilings, carved wooden beams, and large halls hint at the royal gatherings and cultural events that took place here  .\n\nThough visitors can’t enter, it still feels like walking through history. You can admire the elegant façade, spot the wood‑lift shaft, and imagine the palace in its heyday. Nearby gardens hold the king’s burial site, which adds quiet meaning to the place  .\n\nThe palace remains the private home of the Travancore royal family, especially the descendants of the Maharajah’s sister  . Seeing it from the outside gives a sense of Kerala’s royal heritage, smart design, and how tradition and daily life once united here.\n\nIf you drive or walk past, take time to slow down and notice the architecture, the breeze‑friendly layout, the historical importance, and the idea of home it conveys—even without entry, it leaves a memorable impression."

              "reviewText": "The concept of a 'Museum' gains significant value when the treasured heirloom artifacts of a Royal Family are exhibited within their original palace! The atmosphere is exceptional, amplifying the visual appeal of each display. Participating in a guided tour proves to be more fulfilling than exploring independently, as there is a wealth of history and interesting facts associated with each item. It typically requires over an hour and a half to thoroughly appreciate every artifact, but the experience is undoubtedly worthwhile. The visit was captivating. The palace, constructed by Maharaja Swathi Thirunal, provides an in-depth exploration of Kerala’s historical and cultural landscape. The wooden architecture, elaborate carvings, and particularly the distinctive horse motifs (which lend the palace its name) are breathtaking. Strolling through the palace felt akin to traveling back in time, with exquisite artifacts, paintings, and royal memorabilia offering insights into the life of the Travancore royal family. The guides were well-informed and contributed essential context to the exhibits, rendering the tour both educational and engaging. Although photography is prohibited, which may disappoint some visitors, it serves to protect the artifacts. In summary, Kuthiramalika is an essential destination for those passionate about history and architecture. Puthen Malika Palace, also referred to as Puthen Malika Museum, is an essential site to visit in Thiruvananthapuram! This magnificent palace, erected in the 19th century, exemplifies the stunning architecture of Kerala and its rich royal heritage. The intricate wooden carvings and beautiful murals are visually captivating. Every corner narrates a story, and one can truly appreciate the craftsmanship that went into its creation."

It’s not as though the items are one-of-a-kind treasures; they are simply a collection of things. The explanation given for such high charges was quite skillful, but honestly, it turned out to be very disappointing after going inside. Hearing claims like *“the valuables cost crores”* doesn’t justify the price of admission."

Guide available and they'll tell you about everything. The ticket cost 70/- and with chithralayam ticket it's 100. Old sculptures, guns, decorative items and things used in the palace iss kept here. Some of them is over 1000 years old and it's really exciting to visit to such a place. Overall enjoyed a lot. The inside photography cost 500 and I think that's reasonable, if all the items is real!! And I don't understand why 50 rupees for outside photography. Because you can click photos without a ticket, there's no one there to question it or asking ticket for photography outside. So I think that's not necessary at all. Overall a good experience. You can visit there sometime while visiting sreepadmanabha swmy temple, it situated nearly, especially if you're an history buff."

Located right at the heart of Thampanoor, the station is well connected to Chalai Bazaar, bus stands, and other prime areas of the city, making it very convenient for travelers.\n\nThe station building is historic yet modern in its facilities. The platforms are spacious, well-maintained, and equipped with digital display boards that provide clear information about arrivals and departures. Waiting areas are clean, with comfortable seating, and there are plenty of food stalls, tea shops, and small restaurants nearby for refreshments. The ticket counters and online booking kiosks are organized, and staff are generally helpful in guiding passengers.\n\nAnother big advantage is its connectivity – trains from here cover almost all major destinations across India, from Chennai, Bangalore, and Hyderabad to long-distance trains to Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata. For tourists, it is also the gateway to exploring the charm of Trivandrum, including Kovalam Beach, Padmanabhaswamy Temple, and nearby attractions.\n\nSecurity is good with CCTV surveillance, and announcements are regular and clear. Parking space is available, though during peak hours it can get crowded. Overall, Trivandrum Central is a clean, well-managed, and traveler-friendly railway station that offers a smooth experience whether you are arriving, departing, or just passing through."

It’s not one of those massive royal palaces, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in charm and history.\n\nThe building itself is this beautiful old Kerala-style structure with sloping tiled roofs and wooden beams—super traditional and photogenic. You can literally feel the history in the air. It was built way back in the 1600s.\n\nInside, there are museums. The Folklore Museum has some really cool stuff like old musical instruments, traditional lamps, costumes, and even tools people used ages ago. On the ground floor is the coin museum, Ancient coins collections are there. The place isn’t crowded at all—perfect if you want a quiet, thoughtful afternoon. The gardens around the palace are also nice, and it’s a great spot if you’re into photography, culture, or just want a chill outing away from the usual city spots."

              "reviewText": "To be honest, I might’ve been a bit influenced by the stories and rumors, but I didn’t really find anything extraordinary about this palace. It mostly feels like a regular exhibition. If you’ve been to the Keralam History and Heritage Museum, the vibe is pretty similar — except the Keralam Museum has more stunning sculptures, cave paintings, and artistic displays. That said, Koyikkal Palace does have a few things that make it unique. I won’t spoil anything, but there are some interesting elements that are worth checking out. I still encourage everyone to visit it at least once. I went today, and I was the only visitor there 😅 — which actually made the experience even better.You can ask the staff more about the palace’s history or even the rumored stories connected to it — they’re usually happy to share. Entry is super affordable: just ₹30 for adults, ₹10 if you want to use your phone camera, and ₹150 extra if you’re planning to take videos or reels.\n\nSo yeah, not mind-blowing, but peaceful, low-key interesting, and worth a visit if you're into heritage spots."

It was built in the 1840s by Maharaja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma, a king known not just for his rule but also for his deep love of music and the arts.\n\nThe name Kuthiramalika means Palace of Horses, and when you look up at the roof you’ll see 122 wooden horses carved into the structure. That detail alone makes the building special, but there is a lot more inside. The palace is a perfect example of traditional Kerala style, with sloping tiled roofs, wooden carvings, and cool stone floors made from a special mix that includes egg white and charcoal.\n\nInside the museum, each room tells its own story. You’ll see royal thrones, one made of ivory and another of crystal. There are old musical instruments, paintings, chandeliers, mirrors from Europe, and even a wooden tree that makes different musical notes when tapped. A painting by Raja Ravi Varma and life-size Kathakali models are also part of the collection.\n\nThe visit is peaceful. A guide walks you through the rooms and explains the history, helping you imagine how the royal family once lived here. The museum doesn’t feel crowded, and the calm atmosphere makes it easy to enjoy. The tour takes about one to two hours.\n\nPhotography is not allowed inside, but you can take pictures outside if you pay a small fee. The museum is usually closed on Mondays and opens in the afternoon.\n\nIf you are interested in Kerala’s royal history, traditional architecture, or just want to see something different and beautifully preserved, this palace is definitely worth visiting."

The food served here is, without exaggeration, some of the worst I've ever had in Trivandrum. It's disappointing to see such poor standards maintained in a place that sees so many visitors.\n\nIf you're planning to visit, I strongly recommend eating outside the premises if possible. And to those in charge: please consider reevaluating the current food vendor. Bringing in a better contractor could dramatically improve the experience for everyone."

Do not expect too much variety foods from here - you can have noodles, fried rice, sandwiches, cutlet,  french fries, tea, coffee, ice creams, fresh juices etc. The counter is self service so we need to pay money in cash counter and bring in the receipt here for ordering the food. if its crowded we have to wait  for sometime but they will serve as soon as they can. So times we may feel like unattended, that is because of the heavy rush.  There is no roof for the seating and so will be bit difficult during rainy season. Anyway this restaurant will be highly helpful for refresh ourselves after the long walk inside the zoo."

              "reviewText": "I recently had the pleasure of organising the Onam celebration at the Sai Trivandrum Golf Club, for the community of Brio League Centre for Holistic Nutrition. It was a perfect blend of tradition and wellness, with the scenic backdrop of the lush golf course adding a serene touch to the festivities.\n\nThe highlight of the event was undoubtedly the Sadya catered by White Damor. It was a grand feast that perfectly captured the essence of Onam. Every dish was authentic, flavorful, and prepared with fresh ingredients. The variety on the banana leaf—from the delicious sambar, rasam, and avial to the sweet ending with payasam—was a true treat for the senses. What stood out was the balance of traditional flavors with a healthy twist, which resonated with the Brio League’s ethos of holistic nutrition.\n\nThe attention to detail by White Damor was impeccable. Not only did they ensure the Sadya followed traditional customs, but the portion sizes and the quality of the food also reflected a focus on health and wellness. It was comforting to know that one could indulge in a festive meal without compromising on nutrition.\n\nSai Trivandrum Golf Club offered the perfect venue for the celebration. Its sprawling greens, peaceful ambiance, and well-maintained facilities made the event even more enjoyable. The team at Brio League did an excellent job in organizing the event, seamlessly blending cultural celebration with their mission of promoting holistic health.\n\nOverall, the event was a wonderful experience, and the Sadya by White Damor was an unforgettable highlight. I look forward to more such celebrations where tradition meets wellness in a beautiful setting like Sai Trivandrum Golf Club."

A variety of birds, from vibrant songbirds to majestic eagles, add life to the tranquil setting, their melodies weaving into the silence of the rolling greens. The exclusivity of the club enhances its allure, with restricted entry ensuring an atmosphere of peace and privacy. Here, amidst nature’s embrace, every swing feels like a moment of pure escape, a retreat into a world where elegance meets the untouched beauty of the wild."

Trees abound and there are nooks and crannies where you can sit and watch people take up their golf clubs for the first time and practice driving into the nets.\n\nThe atmosphere is tranquil and the greens stretch far into the distance. We're here on a weekend and the number of cars probably exceeds the number of players\n\nThe rooms are big with high ceilings laid out with wooden planks. The balconies are a good place to take in the view.\n\nNot much choice in terms of food but a hot cuppa tea in the morning makes more sense than most other things in life.\n\nWe wandered around the environs and came across a swing with a thin log, not a plank. In most places, when an adult takes to the swing, it looks incongruous. But we were saved by the lack of an audience, even though I took a tumble by trying to step off too soon!"

You can see shades of chinese architecture in the buildings and arena in the club too. However, they are poorly maintained. It isn't open for public but one can book it for function/parties and so on.  The atmosphere is calm and pleasant. There is a cafe, and there are also suit rooms available.. Pet's are not allowed and ironically, one can spot stray dogs here and there."

Professional and well organized.\n\nThe tour was well organized, from the time that we landed at Kochi airport, to the time that we were dropped off on our last day.\n\nAs per the schedule, all items in our itinerary were covered, all accomodations were of acceptable, if not superior standards and the locations covered were exceptional.  The houseboat ride was probably the highlight of the tour.\n\nA very special thanks go to our driver and friend, Mr. Unni, who was a very patient and friendly individual.  He took every precuation possible to ensure that our journey was safe, and made an extra effort each time to drive carefully in order to ensure the safety of the passengers.\n\nAs for suggestions, our only request is that we be prepared with the details of each activity in advance.  As an example, it would have helped us if we were informed beforehand that the boat ride on the Thekkady wildlife sanctuary would involve wearing life-jackets and that the seats would be pre-allocated at the time of purchasing the tickets.  Our expectations of the boat ride was also very high, and were disappointed that we were unable to see the kind of wildlife that we were expecting.  This caused a minor inconvenience during our trip, and could have been avoided if we were informed beforehand.\n\nOverall though, it was a very memorable trip that we will cherish for a very long time."

There is no entertainment. Made me felt like should have choosed some other House boats.\n\nOverall it was a great trip and we didn't felt like roaming in our own city :)"

I went to the opticals in front to buy a contact lens which I have been using but they said they can't give me until I pay and consult the doctor.\nI think then instead of opening the opticals , you shud keep everything inside so that after the doctor's consultation, you can give specs or contacts if u don't provide anything with ppl having prescriptions ."

Special VIP dharshan tickets are available only in-person inside the temple\n5. Cloak rooms are available to keep valuable and cloth\n6. It is nice to visit the nearby Ganesha temple along with it\n7. There are four gates to enter, the east gate is more crowded."

It's really a divine place and you get to see the lord Vishnu in a resting posture and the spirituality, architecture, cleanliness, security and the experience is top notch.\n\nI took the vip darshan with a ₹500 ticket and with this you can get the closest to the idol. I went at 8 am and you can enter through any of the four gates. Tickets are avilable inside the temple. After security check at the entrance head straight to the ticket counter and then joined the queue. Within 30 mins I was infront of lord Vishnu and asked for his blessings. No rush, no pushing and ample time in front of the idol was allowed. Post the darshana, I got prasadam which was included in the ticket price. Then visited lord Ganesha as well which is withing the temple complex. My heart and mind was at peace and I sat there admiring the temple architecture and beauty.\n\nTemple timing are displayed at the entrance and special puja ticket of around ₹3000 is also available. Best time for free darshana is to go early morning when the temple opens at 3am.\n\nAlso please note that dress code need to be strictly followed and no electronic item are allowed inside the temple. You get locker and  bathing facility at nominal rates."

              "reviewText": "Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple in Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, is a revered Hindu shrine dedicated to Lord Vishnu, depicted in a reclining posture on the serpent Anantha. Renowned for its Dravidian architecture and spiritual significance, the temple is one of the 108 Divya Desams dedicated to Vishnu. The temple's main deity is composed of 12,008 saligrams, fossilized shells from the Gandaki River in Nepal, and is preserved using a unique Ayurvedic mixture called \"Katusarkara yogam\" .\n\nThe temple is also famous for its treasure vaults, which were discovered to contain immense wealth, including gold, jewels, and artifacts, making it one of the richest temples in the world . In June 2025, the temple hosted a rare Maha Kumbhabhishekam, a consecration ritual conducted after nearly 270 years, marking a significant event in its history .\n\nVisitors are required to adhere to a strict dress code: men must wear a white dhoti with an angavastram, and women should wear a sari. Entry is permitted only to Hindus, as per the Temple Entry Proclamation . The temple opens for darshan at 3:15 am and closes at 7:20 pm, with various slots for prayers and rituals throughout the day .\n\nWhile the temple offers a profound spiritual experience, some visitors have reported issues such as overcrowding and lack of proper guidance for tourists . Additionally, the temple's treasure vaults have been a subject of legal and spiritual debates, adding to its mystique and intrigue .\n\nOverall, Sri Padmanabhaswamy Temple stands as a testament to Kerala's rich cultural and spiritual heritage, offering visitors a glimpse into the region's deep-rooted traditions and beliefs."

One needs to buy a ticket to enter the museum and there is a paid parking facility available nearby.\nThe architecture of the museum and the park around captivate anyone very easily to visit it from afar. There are sculptures, displays and paintings inside but a limited experience. The place needs more maintenance and the continuous audio ads disturb the peaceful environment of the park."

Spread across a huge, well maintained space, the place is spotlessly clean and beautifully organized, offering a calm escape right in the city.\n\nThe museum itself is free to enter, while the adjoining zoo entry costs just ₹50, which also includes a locker facility for bags and even plastic bottles a thoughtful touch for keeping the space clean. The zoo is expansive, and right outside, a small café serves as the perfect refresher after a walk.\n\nWhat makes this venue special is the balance it offers: while the exhibits and zoo engage your curiosity, the grounds themselves invite you to slow down. There are plenty of shaded spots and tree-side seating areas, making it easy to pause, rest, or just take in the serene atmosphere. Despite the outside heat, the entire space feels naturally cooler, adding to the comfort.\n\nWhether you’re interested in history, looking to enjoy a day amidst nature, or simply searching for a peaceful retreat, Napier Museum is one of those rare places where you can do it all at once."

Nestled among greenery and built with stunning architecture, this historic palace is more than just a monument – it's an experience. I’ve visited this place many times, and every visit feels refreshing and unique.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you is the serene and natural surroundings. The palace is surrounded by sprawling lawns, tall trees, and beautifully landscaped gardens. It’s a perfect spot to unwind and disconnect from the daily hustle of city life. Whether you're coming here with family, friends, or even alone, there’s always a peaceful vibe that makes you feel calm and recharged.\n\nOne of the biggest highlights of Kanakakkunnu is the ambiance during the evenings and night. As the sun sets, the palace and the entire grounds are lit up beautifully, giving it a royal and almost magical charm. The soft lighting, the quiet surroundings, and the cool breeze create a soothing atmosphere that's ideal for night walks, casual conversations, or simply enjoying the beauty around you. The night vibe here is highly recommended, especially if you enjoy peaceful, scenic places with character.\n\nApart from just relaxing, Kanakakkunnu also serves as a cultural hub. Many art exhibitions, cultural events, and traditional programs are held here throughout the year. During festivals or special occasions, the palace comes alive with music, lights, and activities – it’s a great way to experience Kerala's rich culture and traditions.\n\nThere are plenty of open areas where you can sit and enjoy the view, read a book, or even have a casual picnic. The whole campus is clean and well-maintained, which shows the effort taken by the authorities to preserve its beauty. It’s also a popular spot for photography lovers – the combination of old architecture and natural scenery offers the perfect backdrop.\n\nAnother thing I really appreciate is how accessible and welcoming the place is. There is good parking space nearby, and small stalls outside sell tea, coffee, and snacks, making it convenient for visitors. Entry is usually free or minimal, and it's safe even during the night, which is a big plus.\n\nOverall, I would say Kanakakkunnu Palace is not just a tourist attraction – it’s a peaceful retreat, a cultural hotspot, and a heritage landmark all in one. It’s a must-visit place for anyone in or around Thiruvananthapuram, whether you are a local resident or a tourist. If you have a few free hours in the evening or want to explore something beautiful and relaxing, this is the place to go."

You can see many walkers, joggers, and families enjoying the serene atmosphere early in the morning.\n\nThe palace premises have ample space to walk peacefully without crowding, and the natural surroundings with tall trees, flowering plants, and chirping birds create a calm and energetic start to the day. There are benches to rest and shaded areas if you want to sit for a while and relax.\n\nOne of the best places in Trivandrum city to connect with nature, refresh your mind, and begin your day positively. Highly recommended for morning walkers, yoga practitioners, or anyone who loves a calm outdoor space within the city."

It mostly feels like a regular exhibition. If you’ve been to the Keralam History and Heritage Museum, the vibe is pretty similar — except the Keralam Museum has more stunning sculptures, cave paintings, and artistic displays. That said, Koyikkal Palace does have a few things that make it unique. I won’t spoil anything, but there are some interesting elements that are worth checking out. I still encourage everyone to visit it at least once. I went today, and I was the only visitor there 😅 — which actually made the experience even better.You can ask the staff more about the palace’s history or even the rumored stories connected to it — they’re usually happy to share. Entry is super affordable: just ₹30 for adults, ₹10 if you want to use your phone camera, and ₹150 extra if you’re planning to take videos or reels.\n\nSo yeah, not mind-blowing, but peaceful, low-key interesting, and worth a visit if you're into heritage spots."

Credits goes to Mr. Manoj for showcasing high level of professionalism , work ethics and his value to client satisfaction .I appreciate that the installment  was requested only after completion of that portion of work.\nMy day to day interaction with Armson was through Sreelekshmi who coordinated the things very well and was quick to respond to any query.\nComing to Quality of work , One section of work which I felt exceptional are the structural part ie the work of footing , plinth beams and brick work etc. Furthermore post the work they would neatly clean the site which is rare . The delivery of modular kitchen cabinets under workmanship of Shiju , work of Aluminum crockery , the electrical dept. , tilework were also too good.\nThe sections which I felt could be made better would be the painting and plumbing works.\nOverall Quite satisfied with the deliverable . All the best team Armson Homes. Going for 4 star due to overshoot of the scheduled work which had caused little inconvenience as it was a live house."

After meeting a few architects, we chose S Squared architects and it was one of the best decisions we made. The combination of professionalism, their skills not only in the domain of architecture but also in the interactions and understanding our needs is commendable.\nThe design of the patio, the connectivity among some of the rooms in the ground floor, cross ventilation, bringing natural light as an element in the design, unique blend of architecture and comfort for living- these were the highlights.\nThe end result did exceed our expectations and I would highly recommend S Squared architecture to build your dream home."

              "reviewText": "Recently got to know that one of the lavish home in Kerala is designed by S Square Architects Pvt Ltd.\n\nEvery corner of this palatial villa designed by S Squared Architects sparkles with natural elements—from flora and fauna to stonework and water features— making it an instantly inviting and breathtaking home.\n\nThe bungalow built on a six acre property in Trivandrum consists of a semi basement, three floors and a high roof attic. The semi basement houses all the service needs of the house including the electrical rooms, parking spaces, pool tank etc. The bedrooms, living spaces and den are housed on the first and second floor. The most vibrant space of the house is the attic converted into a recreational area dotted with chess and cards table, gaming stations and billiards board. There is also a small pantry for game nights. The piece de resistance is the ceiling which is hand-painted to resemble a vintage map. The flooring makes use of the leftover wood from the construction. A look out balcony on this floor comes with awe-inspiring views of the Indian ocean.\n\nA central courtyard separates the more private spaces from the formal drawing room meant for guests. The five en-suite bedrooms are accessible through foyers from the central courtyard. There is a grand library on the second floor with a home office placed within.\n\nThe crowning glory of the house is the indoor swimming pool. “This is the activity hub of the house with framed views from the dining room, living room, kitchen and the master bedroom. The gym also opens out into this space. There is an interesting bar at the corner. The pool is naturally lit with a skylight that allows the morning light to filter in bestowing upon it a magical sun kissed aura that defines the start of the day. It is an oasis of peace and relaxation for the inhabitants and creates a dramatic escape from the busy life.\n\nPrioritising high-quality materials over ornamentation, the designers wove a sense of bespoke craftsmanship into each room. “We had to acclimatise the design to respond to challenges of the local climate and locally available materials and construction techniques. A skin wall was added to the exterior walls to protect it from the harsh Kerala sun and rain.\n\nA heavy cornice work at the edge of the sloping roof not just conceals the rainwater gutter but also minimises impact of rainwater on the walls. The sandstone slabs left over from the indoor swimming pool flooring was used for the cracked effect flooring of the gazebo reducing wastage of material. The semi basement of the house has been camouflaged using a gently sloping mound of lush green lawn and graceful curved masses of mixed planting which creates a stunning contrast to the honey coloured walls. It’s a quirky house: asymmetrical and interesting, with surprises around every corner."

His works are of such a specialized nature..\n\nMy 4 bedroom house is an example of how perfect architectural planning by Srijit has brought so much comfort and value to my house. The openness inside the house is amazing, the courtyard brings in that freshness and is lively.  The house is minimalist,  there is every protection from heavy rains, sun etc ( all subtly designed) and we are so happy to experience the wonderful spaces with no troubles at all.\nSrijit Srinivas Architects are thorough professionals- they will charge you a reasonable fee, but take my word, you will get all your money's worth, once u see the output.\nThanking you once again for the lovely design” 👍🏾"

The first and only design proposed by Srijit Srinivas met our expectations and reflected the details of our detailed discussions. His commitment and passion for his own designs and towards our Project was palpable in the detailing on safety, simplicity and aesthetics that he gave to our house. We are profoundly delighted by the final work product and the serene and calm environment he created for his architectural baby, which we now call our home. While his rationale for retaining a professional identity as an Architect for his firm is well justified and therefore, dependence on and choice of external civil construction agencies, Srijit might wish to consider a growing expectation from his prospective clients to identify a committed self sustaining civil engineering team as part and parcel of his own firm - who will have the ability to read his marvellous designs and convert them into elegant rational forms.\n\nVery happy to have been associated with Srijit for our own Project. It is a relationship that we as a family have built beyond Srijit's professional prowess. I would thoroughly recommend Srijit Srinivas as a thinking professional architect, if you are ever in search of one."

After an elaborate search on the net, i came across Srijit sirs work and i had this instant gut feeling to go for him.\nOnce we had an official discussion where we sat down for describing our needs and purposes, which he wholeheartedly accepted , we were all immensely happy.\nAll he said was “Now leave everything to me” and from there on he took the full responsibility of getting our dream house completed on time even when the Covid situation was prevailing.\nI would say i have rarely come across a person with such clarity of thoughts and extra ordinary visualisation! Both of these virtues makes an architect  stand out from the rest.\nthough its been 2 years since we moved to our new home , its still as special as it was on day one. All credits go to the Architect himself. 🙌🏻"

It's not often that we see an architect who keeps the barrier so high for himself in everything he does in the project.  Srijit always comes out with minimal and neat, yet in-vogue /head-turning designs. Aesthetics is his forte and he does micro detailing  to levels which baffles one.\n\nOn hindsight, one of the best things I have ever done is to have resisted the urge to  provide \"client's gyaan\" to Srijit on his design choices!  Each time we (my wife and myself) felt the urge to 'improvise' on Srijit's design/aesthetics related related choices - we did not press for it.\n\"Let us leave it to Srijit, he should be right\" - was our refrain.  Once the house was completed, we realised how right and wise - we were!\n\nIn short - Leave it to Srijit. He will help you build a beautiful home :)"

The construction was poorly executed and many mistakes were made, resulting in a final product that is below average. Communication was also lacking throughout the project, making it difficult to address and rectify these issues in a timely manner. I would not recommend this builder to anyone and would advise others to look for a more qualified and reliable contractor.\n\n1. They won't respond once the payment is done. Delayed my home construction for 3 months.\n2. Wooden works are not yet finished. Always ask for extra money and even dare to ask permission for doing additional work, just give you a bill/amount to pay for.\n3. They said they will do all the paper works for get the home construction permit and house number, but they didn't do anything.\n4. The simple elevation we had selected was not met and the builder did not live up to their promise of delivering a quality construction.\n5. It has been over a year since the completion of the construction project and the builder has failed to address and rectify the numerous issues that were present. Despite multiple attempts to contact and hold them accountable, they have been non-responsive and uncooperative in making any necessary repairs or corrections."

Their focus is only on money, not the quality of service.\n2. They can't complete or properly finish even very simple elevation.\n3. Heavily promise, but subpar in delivering.\n4. They did not provide even staircase to terrace, so that space is nearly useless.\n5. Woods are below quality, with in an year it shows cracks and started to bend. (Even they forgot to provide hooks for windows)\n6. They did not covered manhole properly with cast iron cover, just placed remaining piece of tile above the manhole, which is slippery my kid fell over it many times.\n7. Water tap is already complained several times.\n\nGentleness is only in their name, i couldn't experience it in their service."

At this time local Protestants in Trivandrum worshipped in a church constructed by the Protestant Evangelical Trust in the 1830s. After Rev Cox resigned in 1861, he was succeeded by Rev Samuel Mateer, who led the church for 30 years and died in 1893. By this time the congregation had grown and needed larger premises and it planned to build a new church building in memory of Rev Mateer. The architectural style used in constructing the church was Hallenkirche (hall church) style. The church building was made in granite, with a square bell tower with a vestibule beneath and a roof supported by gothic arches. The Celtic cross on the bell tower is made of cut stone and commemorates Mateer's Irish background."

I was very skeptical about the construction in my plot due to its irregular orientation. After meeting and discussing with Mr.Christin I was given multiple options of design which helped  see the bigger picture. I really appreciate the design team for bringing forth multiple design options within a short span of time, considering all my requirements and always being available for discussions  and changes. The friendly approach of the entire team definitely helped me in being more comfortable in sharing the ideas I personally have about my house. Coming to the execution part the same friendly and approachable attitude is maintained throughout the process. The only drawback I was even though it was resolved later on was the communication and misinterpretations  during the final stage of the construction. Apart from that I really enjoyed the association  and living in\nthe  house since 2015 . Thank you for your sincere efforts and contributions. Wishing you for your future endeavors."

Sorry for the long message.\n\nIt was during 2022, when I actively started searching for a good interior firm who could do the interior work for my apartment in Trivandrum.\nI came across iNova infra from one of the YouTube videos that they published on their account. The Google reviews also suggested more than a 4.75 rating for them at that time!\nI went to their office near Infosys (Trivandrum), had multiple discussions, a site visit, and finally handed over the work to them officially during the first week of August 2022.\nAlso paid the token advance during the second week of August. Till then, everything was going really well.\nI was satisfied with the discussions we had, the quick responses to my messages/calls, the site visit they arranged - even though it was an ongoing work.\n\nBut things were different from the moment I paid the advance money (or when they got a hint that I was going to be with them for sure).\nThey started responding really late to my calls/messages (sometimes no response at all), and I was forced to visit their office a number of times to get some updates on the work status.\nI was informed that the next steps would be to sign an agreement and also start the design work.\nIt took almost 3 weeks for them to prepare a draft agreement and also come up with a 'TV UNIT DESIGN' - after a number of follow-up calls/messages, visits, etc!!!\nUpon suggesting one correction, it took them another 5 weeks to come back with the corrected TV unit design and a new KITCHEN UNIT design!!!\nAgain, after a number of calls/messages and 'visits' to their office!!!\nThen it again took 3 more weeks for them to come up with a draft pooja unit and a wash unit design—after a number of follow-up calls/messages/visits, etc!!!\n\nIN SHORT : the work that they initially assured to complete within 45–50 days of time period was not even initiated even after 3 months!\nThe progress they made was that they got the advance money from me and a few draft designs on which multiple corrections were suggested.\n\nFinally, I lost all hope and called it off—by the end of Nov-2023.\n\nI do have all the proofs (call logs, whatsapp messages, payment receipt, etc) to justify what I have written above.\nI was thinking of filing a case against them legally, but I got busy with my apartment work.\nLater, decided not to move in that direction and spend more of my time, energy, and more money.. Peace !!!! :)\n\nI hope this review will be helpful for those who try to consider iNova Infra as an option.\nFrom my experience, if you have a lot of time to do the work, then iNova Infra is definitely a good choice. But if you are trying to complete the work quickly, better search for other alternatives."

Once I met Christin, I really got confident about going  ahead with the project in full fledge. He certainly explained to me the life cycle of the whole project  with respect to it's cost and designs. I talked about my choice regarding the selection of materials for the works.\nHis team Abhiraj and others had developed a wonderful design in our uneven looking plot to make it perfectly cozy.They used cent percent prime quality materials throughout the project according to their specifications. Some additional amount had to be laid down as we selected products of  higher cost other than their spec.\nThe only hitch I found was that they got one month delayed for completing  my 3100sq ft dream home.\nI recommend this design consultancy I nova infra to all as I left  them totally happy and satisfied. And I am living in my 🏡 home with fullfillment, every day since 2017. Best Wishes ."

From what I have heard and seen it takes forever for them to start the operations of accident morning my friends have to wait nearly 12 hours and I have hot of a lot more cases like that. But if you have a major accident of any thoughts and you go to the general hospital or any smaller government hospitals they are going to send you here. But I would highly recommend you to go to a private hospital if you have the finances or a health insurance that can cover.

Highly process oriented discourses which are deep-rooted in personal narra­tives blent with the stories of people and place enable the student to perceive the perceptional, behavioural and psychological dimensions of space and to translate the thoughts into built forms.",

You need to call and book your visit and the park will be open exclusively for you.  As of now they welcome only one group per day.     You are required to report in the morning 09.30am and stay back till evening 4:30pm\n\nThe visit involves a lecture-cum-interaction section with Suresh Sir, followed by multiple lab visits.   Each lab the volunteers walk you through a series of experiments, and then lets the kids to do experiments themselves.   There is a lot of enthusiasm from the organizers' side.    One must carry a pen and notebook so that they can note down observations and potential questions.  Finally there is a closing lecture-cum-interaction.\n\nThe visit is long. But it is really worth it.    You can take a break in between from experiments and play some small games like darts etc that is set up.\n\nFood is not available in the location.   Either you could carry food or ask Suresh Sir to give some caterer's contact who will serve it."

That seemed illogical to me so I didn't do it.\nI handed the phone to a local repair shop and they said it was a short on the motherboard and they fixed it for ₹500.
