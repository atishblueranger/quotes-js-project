The architecture, divine energy and rich Kerala tradition well witnessed in this sacred place.\n\nTips for a pleasant visit:\n1. Strict dress code to be followed by devotees ( traditional dress for women and only dhoti with towel for men) Shirt and T-shirts are not allowed\n2. Temple dharshan timings are quite different from other temples....plan accordingly\n3. Early morning Dharshan is less crowded, otherwise there is a waiting period of 1-2 hours as per crowd\n4. Special VIP dharshan tickets are available only in-person inside the temple\n5. Cloak rooms are available to keep valuable and cloth\n6. It is nice to visit the nearby Ganesha temple along with it\n7. There are four gates to enter, the east gate is more crowded.",

The intricate carvings and stunning deities created a sense of tranquility, allowing me to connect with my spirituality. The priests were warm and welcoming, offering insightful guidance and blessings. The community's dedication to preserving traditions and serving devotees is truly commendable. I felt a deep sense of peace and gratitude during my visit. Highly recommended for those seeking spiritual growth and connection.\nSecurity is a bit high compared to any other religious places which may due to the wealthy nature of deity",

It's really a divine place and you get to see the lord Vishnu in a resting posture and the spirituality, architecture, cleanliness, security and the experience is top notch.\n\nI took the vip darshan with a ₹500 ticket and with this you can get the closest to the idol. I went at 8 am and you can enter through any of the four gates. Tickets are avilable inside the temple. After security check at the entrance head straight to the ticket counter and then joined the queue. Within 30 mins I was infront of lord Vishnu and asked for his blessings. No rush, no pushing and ample time in front of the idol was allowed. Post the darshana, I got prasadam which was included in the ticket price. Then visited lord Ganesha as well which is withing the temple complex. My heart and mind was at peace and I sat there admiring the temple architecture and beauty.\n\nTemple timing are displayed at the entrance and special puja ticket of around ₹3000 is also available. Best time for free darshana is to go early morning when the temple opens at 3am.\n\nAlso please note that dress code need to be strictly followed and no electronic item are allowed inside the temple. You get locker and  bathing facility at nominal rates.",

            "text": "Building a house has always been a dream for us and Infra I Nova have helped us achieve the dream. I was very skeptical about the construction in my plot due to its irregular orientation. After meeting and discussing with Mr.Christin I was given multiple options of design which helped  see the bigger picture. I really appreciate the design team for bringing forth multiple design options within a short span of time, considering all my requirements and always being available for discussions  and changes. The friendly approach of the entire team definitely helped me in being more comfortable in sharing the ideas I personally have about my house. Coming to the execution part the same friendly and approachable attitude is maintained throughout the process. The only drawback I was even though it was resolved later on was the communication and misinterpretations  during the final stage of the construction. Apart from that I really enjoyed the association  and living in\nthe  house since 2015 . Thank you for your sincere efforts and contributions. Wishing you for your future endeavors.",

Sorry for the long message.\n\nIt was during 2022, when I actively started searching for a good interior firm who could do the interior work for my apartment in Trivandrum.\nI came across iNova infra from one of the YouTube videos that they published on their account. The Google reviews also suggested more than a 4.75 rating for them at that time!\nI went to their office near Infosys (Trivandrum), had multiple discussions, a site visit, and finally handed over the work to them officially during the first week of August 2022.\nAlso paid the token advance during the second week of August. Till then, everything was going really well.\nI was satisfied with the discussions we had, the quick responses to my messages/calls, the site visit they arranged - even though it was an ongoing work.\n\nBut things were different from the moment I paid the advance money (or when they got a hint that I was going to be with them for sure).\nThey started responding really late to my calls/messages (sometimes no response at all), and I was forced to visit their office a number of times to get some updates on the work status.\nI was informed that the next steps would be to sign an agreement and also start the design work.\nIt took almost 3 weeks for them to prepare a draft agreement and also come up with a 'TV UNIT DESIGN' - after a number of follow-up calls/messages, visits, etc!!!\nUpon suggesting one correction, it took them another 5 weeks to come back with the corrected TV unit design and a new KITCHEN UNIT design!!!\nAgain, after a number of calls/messages and 'visits' to their office!!!\nThen it again took 3 more weeks for them to come up with a draft pooja unit and a wash unit design-after a number of follow-up calls/messages/visits, etc!!!\n\nIN SHORT : the work that they initially assured to complete within 45–50 days of time period was not even initiated even after 3 months!\nThe progress they made was that they got the advance money from me and a few draft designs on which multiple corrections were suggested.\n\nFinally, I lost all hope and called it off-by the end of Nov-2023.\n\nI do have all the proofs (call logs, whatsapp messages, payment receipt, etc) to justify what I have written above.\nI was thinking of filing a case against them legally, but I got busy with my apartment work.\nLater, decided not to move in that direction and spend more of my time, energy, and more money.. Peace !!!! :)\n\nI hope this review will be helpful for those who try to consider iNova Infra as an option.\nFrom my experience, if you have a lot of time to do the work, then iNova Infra is definitely a good choice. But if you are trying to complete the work quickly, better search for other alternatives.",

The zoo is expansive, and right outside, a small café serves as the perfect refresher after a walk.\n\nWhat makes this venue special is the balance it offers: while the exhibits and zoo engage your curiosity, the grounds themselves invite you to slow down. There are plenty of shaded spots and tree-side seating areas, making it easy to pause, rest, or just take in the serene atmosphere. Despite the outside heat, the entire space feels naturally cooler, adding to the comfort.\n\nWhether you're interested in history, looking to enjoy a day amidst nature, or simply searching for a peaceful retreat, Napier Museum is one of those rare places where you can do it all at once.",

It's not one of those massive royal palaces, but what it lacks in size, it makes up for in charm and history.\n\nThe building itself is this beautiful old Kerala-style structure with sloping tiled roofs and wooden beams-super traditional and photogenic. You can literally feel the history in the air. It was built way back in the 1600s.\n\nInside, there are museums. The Folklore Museum has some really cool stuff like old musical instruments, traditional lamps, costumes, and even tools people used ages ago. On the ground floor is the coin museum, Ancient coins collections are there. The place isn't crowded at all-perfect if you want a quiet, thoughtful afternoon. The gardens around the palace are also nice, and it's a great spot if you're into photography, culture, or just want a chill outing away from the usual city spots.",

Credits goes to Mr. Manoj for showcasing high level of professionalism , work ethics and his value to client satisfaction .I appreciate that the installment  was requested only after completion of that portion of work.\nMy day to day interaction with Armson was through Sreelekshmi who coordinated the things very well and was quick to respond to any query.\nComing to Quality of work , One section of work which I felt exceptional are the structural part ie the work of footing , plinth beams and brick work etc. Furthermore post the work they would neatly clean the site which is rare . The delivery of modular kitchen cabinets under workmanship of Shiju , work of Aluminum crockery , the electrical dept. , tilework were also too good.\nThe sections which I felt could be made better would be the painting and plumbing works.\nOverall Quite satisfied with the deliverable .

The design studios and courses have been meticulously detailed for students to understand architecture as a multifaceted discipline, a thought process and away of life which is highly empathetic to the people and surroundings. Highly process oriented discourses which are deep-rooted in personal narra­tives blent with the stories of people and place enable the student to perceive the perceptional, behavioural and psychological dimensions of space and to translate the thoughts into built forms.",

You need to call and book your visit and the park will be open exclusively for you.  As of now they welcome only one group per day.     You are required to report in the morning 09.30am and stay back till evening 4:30pm\n\nThe visit involves a lecture-cum-interaction section with Suresh Sir, followed by multiple lab visits.   Each lab the volunteers walk you through a series of experiments, and then lets the kids to do experiments themselves.   There is a lot of enthusiasm from the organizers' side.    One must carry a pen and notebook so that they can note down observations and potential questions.  Finally there is a closing lecture-cum-interaction.\n\nThe visit is long. But it is really worth it.    You can take a break in between from experiments and play some small games like darts etc that is set up.\n\nFood is not available in the location.   Either you could carry food or ask Suresh Sir to give some caterer's contact who will serve it.",
