Tickets were priced at ₹240 per person. It was quite hot that day, but the short ropeway ride - just a few minutes from the bottom to the hilltop - was comfortable and offered beautiful views.\n\nThe temple itself has a simple and peaceful architecture, which adds to its charm. However, be prepared for long queues at every step, from the ropeway boarding point to the temple entrance and inside the temple premises. Despite the crowd, the overall experience was spiritually uplifting.\n\nThe ropeway is well-managed, and the staff was helpful, but due to the heat and waiting time, it's a good idea to carry water and maybe visit earlier in the day. Overall, a memorable visit to one of Haridwar's most sacred spots!",

Early Morning Trekking is also good option to enjoy panaramic view.\n\nYou can either buy combo of Mansa devi and chandi devi temple the only thing is you should be able to reach both temples on the same day if there's no long queues then it's easy. When we went in 2022 combo charges 324 rs per person while only chandi devi temple ticket charges 195 rs per person.\n\nTemple is clean and well maintained. Temple premises contains idols of lord kali ma, sankat mochan hanuman, Maa Annapurna, Santoshi Maa etc. This siddhpeeth is heavy crowded on festive like Navratri and holiday season. There are waiting halls at each levels and quite nice dining cafe inside and children game area to spend sometime. You'll find beautiful dress photography studies at all places in haridwar rishikesh masoorie.",

It is one of three such Peethas located in Haridwar, the other two being Mansa Devi Temple and Maya Devi Temple.\n\nGoddess Chandi also known as Chandika is the presiding deity of the temple. The story of the origin of Chandika is as follows: Long time ago, the demon kings Shumbha and Nishumbha had captured the kingdom of the god-king of heaven - Indra and thrown the gods from Swarga (heaven). After intense prayers by the gods, a goddess emerged from Parvati. An exceptionally beautiful woman and amazed by her beauty, Shumbha desired to marry her. On being refused, Shumbha sent his demon chiefs Chanda and Munda to kill her. They were killed by goddess Chamunda who originated out of Chandika's anger. Shumbha and Nishumbha then collectively tried to kill Chandika but were instead slain by the goddess. Thereafter, Chandika is said to have rested for a short while at the top of Neel Parvat and later a temple was built here to testify the legend. Also, the two peaks located in the mountain range are called Shumbha and Nishumbha.",

This sacred site holds deep significance in Hindu mythology, marking the place where King Daksha performed his yajna and where Goddess Sati, overcome with grief and devotion, surrendered herself to the sacred fire.\n\nThe temple echoes the divine tale of Lord Shiva's sorrow, the creation of Virbhadra, and the eternal love between Shiva and Sati - a story of cosmic energy, sacrifice, and spiritual union. Even today, the energy here is palpable - peaceful yet deeply powerful.\n\nAs you walk through the temple's corridors, you don't just witness devotion… you feel it. The gentle chimes of the bells, the fragrance of incense, and the chants in the air transport you to another realm. It's a place where time slows down, where the heart feels light, and where the spirit quietly bows.\n\nA must-visit for every spiritual traveler, devotee, or seeker of divine peace. Daksheswar Mahadev Temple is not just a destination - it's a divine moment carved into the heart of Haridwar.\n\nReview by @the_solo_wanderer_\nFor more stories and spiritual travel moments, search me on Instagram. 🌿📸",
