Tickets were priced at ₹240 per person. It was quite hot that day, but the short ropeway ride — just a few minutes from the bottom to the hilltop — was comfortable and offered beautiful views.\n\nThe temple itself has a simple and peaceful architecture, which adds to its charm. However, be prepared for long queues at every step, from the ropeway boarding point to the temple entrance and inside the temple premises. Despite the crowd, the overall experience was spiritually uplifting.\n\nThe ropeway is well-managed, and the staff was helpful, but due to the heat and waiting time, it’s a good idea to carry water and maybe visit earlier in the day. Overall, a memorable visit to one of Haridwar’s most sacred spots!"

We went by ropeway to enjoy bird's eye view of Haridwar, Ganda river and  surrounding hills. Early Morning Trekking is also good option to enjoy panaramic view.\n\nYou can either buy combo of Mansa devi and chandi devi temple the only thing is you should be able to reach both temples on the same day if there's no long queues then it's easy. When we went in 2022 combo charges 324 rs per person while only chandi devi temple ticket charges 195 rs per person.\n\nTemple is clean and well maintained. Temple premises contains idols of lord kali ma, sankat mochan hanuman, Maa Annapurna, Santoshi Maa etc. This siddhpeeth is heavy crowded on festive like Navratri and holiday season. There are waiting halls at each levels and quite nice dining cafe inside and children game area to spend sometime. You'll find beautiful dress photography studies at all places in haridwar rishikesh masoorie."

It is one of three such Peethas located in Haridwar, the other two being Mansa Devi Temple and Maya Devi Temple.\n\nGoddess Chandi also known as Chandika is the presiding deity of the temple. The story of the origin of Chandika is as follows: Long time ago, the demon kings Shumbha and Nishumbha had captured the kingdom of the god-king of heaven - Indra and thrown the gods from Swarga (heaven). After intense prayers by the gods, a goddess emerged from Parvati. An exceptionally beautiful woman and amazed by her beauty, Shumbha desired to marry her. On being refused, Shumbha sent his demon chiefs Chanda and Munda to kill her. They were killed by goddess Chamunda who originated out of Chandika's anger. Shumbha and Nishumbha then collectively tried to kill Chandika but were instead slain by the goddess. Thereafter, Chandika is said to have rested for a short while at the top of Neel Parvat and later a temple was built here to testify the legend. Also, the two peaks located in the mountain range are called Shumbha and Nishumbha."

The views from the temple are breathtaking, especially during sunrise. The ropeway (Chandi Devi Udankhatola) is well-organized and makes the journey convenient, especially for elderly visitors. It's about a 5–10 minute ride offering scenic views of the Ganga and surrounding hills. The temple is clean, well-maintained, and has a peaceful vibe. Darshan is usually smooth, but it can get crowded during festivals. A must-visit when in Haridwar"

If you're in a hurry, visiting on a sunny hot day, I would suggest going for the ropeway otherwise trek is also a good option. It has a scenic view but #*BEWARE OF MONKEYS*#\n\nThe temple is quiet and peaceful. Even on a weekend, the atmosphere and vibe is all heavenly and healthy. There won't be any rush if you go in early morning hours and there are plenty of shops where you can buy the \"prasad\" so don't stick on one and move forward. There are no charges for the show keeping and #Beware of pickpockets#\n\nFew steps upward is another temple, if you're going here I'll suggest to visit that one as well. It is also very calm and peaceful\n\nFor the #parking\nThere is no such proper place. U might have to park on the road, near the hill or along the mountains.\n\nFor #ropeway\nThere are plenty of cable cars and hence your number will arrive soon. Even though you book online, you would have to wait and take ur number from here. A counter is present here, you can also buy tickets offline from there. If you are planning to visit mansa devi temple as well, I would suggest u to buy the tickets beforehand, either from this counter or online, cz there the crowd and rush is 🫡\nLast but not the least, don't forget to buy the peda from here, the most loved prasad."

              "reviewText": "Visiting the Maa Chandi Devi Temple in Haridwar is a journey filled with devotion, peace, and divine energy. Situated atop the Neel Parvat on the eastern side of the Ganga River, this temple is one of the most revered Shakti Peethas and a must-visit for anyone coming to Haridwar.\n\nThe experience begins with either a ropeway ride (Chandi Devi Udankhatola) or a scenic uphill trek. The ropeway offers breathtaking views of the city, Ganga River, and lush hills — it feels as if you're slowly ascending toward the divine. Once you reach the top, the calmness of the surroundings and the ringing of temple bells instantly create a spiritual atmosphere.\n\nInside the temple, the idol of Maa Chandi Devi, believed to have been installed by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century, is powerful and awe-inspiring. Devotees offer flowers, coconuts, and prayers with deep devotion. The temple priests are humble and guide visitors respectfully through the rituals.\n\nIt is believed that worshipping here helps one overcome obstacles, fear, and negativity. During Navratri and other special occasions, the temple sees thousands of devotees, yet it still holds a peaceful vibration that touches the heart.\n\nThe view from the temple is equally divine — you can see the majestic flow of the Ganga and the holy city of Haridwar from above. The air feels fresh, and the spiritual energy is high.\n\nIn summary, Maa Chandi Devi Temple is more than a place of worship — it’s a sacred experience of strength, surrender, and divine motherly love. A visit here brings not just blessings, but a deep inner peace. 🌸⛰️🙏"

So one need not leave it near any shop and then be forced to buy stuff from them. There is a coconut breaking area at the back... Otherwise all the pooja stuff we buy is dumped into a box. So avoid buying those small red bags for Rs.100. Darshan shall be quick and one will get ample time to see and pray mata ji. On the way back for ropeway users there is a small cafeteria with snacks at affordable prices.\nNon consent photography for the pure intent of making money is something I dislike.

The temple is dedicated to Goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to fulfill the wishes of her devotees.\n\nView from Haridwar: You can see the temple clearly from many places in Haridwar, as it sits high above the town. It looks especially beautiful in the early morning or evening.\n\nHow to Reach the Temple:\n\nBy Cable Car (Ropeway):\nYou can walk for about 10–15 minutes from Har Ki Pauri or the main Haridwar area to reach the ticket counter. It’s a short, easy walk through the market. The cable car ride is quick and gives you great views of the town and the Ganga river.\n\nBy Trekking:\nThere is a steep uphill path with around 1,000 steps. It takes about 30–45 minutes to reach the top if you go at a steady pace. The trek is tiring but gives you a peaceful experience through nature.\n\nTip: Carry enough water, wear comfortable shoes, and try to avoid trekking during hot afternoons. There are a few shaded spots to rest along the way, but not many stalls, so be prepared.\n\nView from the Top: Once at the top, you’ll see a beautiful view of Haridwar city and the river Ganga flowing through it. It’s a peaceful and spiritual place, often with cool breezes.\n\nAbout the Temple: Inside the temple are idols of Goddess Mansa Devi in two forms. Devotees often tie threads to a holy tree near the temple, making a wish. When their wish comes true, they come back to untie the thread. You can offer coconuts, flowers, and prasad at the temple.\n\nHistory: The temple was built in the early 1800s by Maharaja Gopal Singh. It is one of the five important pilgrimage spots (Panch Tirth) in Haridwar.\nQuick Tips:\n\nBest time to visit: Early morning or evening (to avoid heat and crowd).\n\nCable car tickets may have long queues during weekends and holidays—go early.\n\nCarry water, snacks, and a cap if you’re trekking.\n\nDress modestly and keep your belongings safe in the crowd."

The premises are spacious enough to accommodate devotees comfortably, and despite the rush, everything was well-managed.\nYou can reach the temple either by ropeway (₹400 per person for a round trip) or by walking. I chose the ropeway and enjoyed the smooth ride with breathtaking views of Haridwar city and the Ganga river. The darshan was well-arranged and did not take too long.\nAfter visiting the temple, I explored Moti Bazar nearby for some shopping and later went to Har Ki Pauri to witness the Ganga Aarti, which made the entire trip complete and memorable. A must-visit place in Haridwar for blessings and peace of mind. 🙏"

The concept is patriotic and educational, with each of its eight floors showcasing different themes—ranging from freedom fighters and revered women of India to saints from various religions and deities from Hindu mythology. The structure itself is impressive, and the views from the top are quite nice.\n\nHowever, I found the overall experience to be just average. While the lift is convenient for reaching higher floors (with a small fee), coming down requires taking the stairs, which may be difficult for elderly visitors. The temple can sometimes get crowded, and the atmosphere, although culturally rich, doesn’t always feel very spiritual. Cleanliness and maintenance were decent, but nothing extraordinary, and there’s little guidance or signage to help visitors fully appreciate the significance of each floor.\n\nIn summary, Bharat Mata Temple is worth a visit for its concept and architecture, especially if you have an interest in Indian history and culture. But don’t expect a deeply spiritual experience or top-notch facilities. Overall, a satisfactory stop in Haridwar, but not a must-see if you’re short on time."

This sacred site holds deep significance in Hindu mythology, marking the place where King Daksha performed his yajna and where Goddess Sati, overcome with grief and devotion, surrendered herself to the sacred fire.\n\nThe temple echoes the divine tale of Lord Shiva’s sorrow, the creation of Virbhadra, and the eternal love between Shiva and Sati — a story of cosmic energy, sacrifice, and spiritual union. Even today, the energy here is palpable — peaceful yet deeply powerful.\n\nAs you walk through the temple’s corridors, you don’t just witness devotion… you feel it.

Other temples are also present but most of them are operated by lalchi pujari who forces bhakts to donate.\n\nTemple flooring is being constructed again,now it looks beautiful but it can be made more beautiful."

              "reviewText": "Daksheshwar Mahadev Temple, commonly known as Daksha Mahadev Temple, is one of the most revered and historically rich temples located in Kankhal, a sacred town near Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, this temple holds immense spiritual and mythological significance, attracting devotees, pilgrims, and history lovers from across the country throughout the year.\n\nThis ancient temple is believed to be built at the very site where King Daksha Prajapati, father of Sati (Goddess Parvati), performed the famous Yajna (sacrifice) that led to the tragic self-immolation of Sati and Lord Shiva's immense grief and rage. According to Hindu mythology, this event is pivotal as it led to the creation of the powerful divine entity, Lord Veerabhadra, and eventually the reunion of Shiva and Sati. The temple thus holds a deep emotional and symbolic significance for followers of Shaivism and Hinduism at large.\n\nThe architecture of Daksheshwar Temple is simple yet elegant. The sanctum sanctorum houses a sacred Shiva Lingam, around which the temple structure has been built. The white walls with golden detailing, red shikhara (spire), and beautifully maintained premises create a serene atmosphere ideal for prayer and reflection. The temple is surrounded by other smaller shrines and a sacred pond, enhancing its spiritual charm.\n\nVisitors appreciate the calmness of the temple complex, despite its popularity. Devotees often engage in Rudra Abhishek and other rituals, which are performed with devotion by the temple priests. During the Maha Shivaratri and Shravan months, the temple witnesses a surge in pilgrims, and the air becomes electrified with chants of “Om Namah Shivaya.”\n\nThe temple management is known for its cleanliness, organized rituals, and informative displays for visitors. Clean washrooms, shoe racks, and shaded waiting areas make the visit comfortable even during peak hours. Adequate security and friendly staff ensure a smooth spiritual experience.\n\nIn addition to its religious significance, the temple is located close to other prominent sites like Sati Kund and Birbhadra Temple, making it part of an enriching spiritual circuit in Haridwar.\n\nConclusion:\nDaksheshwar Mahadev Temple is not just a place of worship but a gateway into the profound mythology and devotion embedded in Hindu tradition. Its sacred atmosphere, historical relevance, and peaceful surroundings make it a must-visit for anyone seeking spiritual solace or insight into India’s ancient heritage."

Just as the stone of Shivling of Pashupatinath temple of Nepal is considered as Paras stone, similarly the stone of Shivling of Haridwar temple is also of Paras stone. After Nepal, Pashupatinath's temple is only in Haridwar. There is not a third temple like these temples in the whole world.  Shivalinga is considered a replica of Nepal's temple in Pashupatinath temple built in Haridwar, on the lines of Pashupatinath temple of Nepal. The status of Pashupatinath Temple in Haridwar is considered as much as the Pashupatinath Temple in Nepal. The virtuous benefit that will be gained from the darshan of Dwadash Jyotirlinga Pashupatinath Mahadev at Kathmandu, the same benefit will be obtained from the Darshan at the Pashupatinath temple located at Shravannath Math in Moti Bazaar, Haridwar."
