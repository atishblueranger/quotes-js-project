It was crispy with a rich charcoal flavour on the outside, perfectly tender inside, and paired beautifully with the carrot purée. It was the star of the meal.\n\nHowever, I was quite disappointed to learn that the homemade ravioli, which I had seen listed online as a “must-try,” is no longer available. I was really looking forward to tasting it, so that was a bit of a letdown.\n\nSome small details affected the experience as well. The plates on the table was quite dusty and didn't seem fully clean, which was a little off-putting. On the upside, the overall atmosphere and vibes were great. It would be helpful if, during the reservation process, guests could choose their preferred seating area-whether indoors, at the front, or in a sunnier spot-so expectations are better managed.\n\nAs for the rest of the food, the mushroom risotto was decent but not outstanding. We've had better elsewhere. The traditional Greek pasta was okay, and the Greek salad was fresh and enjoyable.\n\nIn the end, the pork belly truly made the experience worth it. It's a must-try if you visit.",

I didn't get the confirmation email in the morning, so we decided to walk in. We were so lucky to get seated immediately. As soon as we started ordering, they got really busy. Service was fantastic. It did take a while for food to come out but its understandable since we were busy. That same morning, my husband went here for breakfast and he loved it.Everything we ordered for lunch was heavenly good!!! My favorites were the Smyrni Style Soutzoukakia and Mastelo Lamb from the Island Sifnos. I've heard good things about their Greek stuffed calamari and really wanted to try, but it was sadly crossed off the menu. Overall, it's a very good place for breakfast and lunch with many Vegan and Vegetarian options. We definitely come back when visiting Santorini in the future. Highly recommend it!",

It was, without a doubt, the most delicious lamb we've ever tasted! The meat was tender, succulent, and full of aromatic herbs, leaving a lasting impression.\n\nIn fact, we enjoyed it so much that we came back the very next day for lunch! The consistency in food quality and service was outstanding, proving that this restaurant truly excels in every aspect.\n\nTo top it off, the staff were incredibly polite, attentive, and made us feel truly welcome.

We were warmly welcomed by the incredible staff, who not only remembered our names throughout our stay but also made us feel genuinely at home. They even carried our luggage straight to our room, which was such a thoughtful touch after a long journey.\n\nOur suite was stunning, complete with a private pool that overlooked the caldera – waking up to that view every morning felt like a dream. Without a doubt, this hotel offers the best view in Oia – postcard-perfect sunsets right from our terrace.\n\nThe location was ideal – peaceful and private, yet just steps away from all the restaurants, shops, and famous photo spots. Everything we wanted to see and do was within easy reach.\n\nOne of the many thoughtful touches: we had a very early flight, and the staff surprised us with a beautifully packed breakfast box to take with us. That kind of attention to detail really stood out and made us feel so well cared for.\n\nThis was easily one of the best hotel experiences we've ever had. Every detail, from the exceptional service to the breathtaking scenery, made it unforgettable. We're already dreaming of coming back!",

The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and cared for throughout our entire visit.\n\nOne of the absolute highlights was dining at Black Rock Restaurant. Every meal was a culinary masterpiece - fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented. The quality of ingredients, creativity of the dishes, and impeccable service easily make it one of the best dining experiences we've had, not just on the island, but anywhere.\n\nWe also want to address a common concern for travelers: despite recent news reports about seismic activity in the region, we've found no evidence of any earthquake damage here. Everything on the island is operating smoothly - the roads, resorts, restaurants, and experiences are all fully functional and completely safe. You would never know there had been any sort of scare.\n\nSantorini is not only as breathtaking as ever - it's also fully open, peaceful, and welcoming. If you're considering a visit, don't hesitate.

The unique experience started with men carrying our bags from our drop off point down all of the stairs to the friendly welcome that we received with a fruity cocktail overlooking the cliffs and the breathtaking views of the water. We were greeted and checked in by the hotel manager as we soaked up the beauty of Oia's water. Our suite with a hot tub was superb with a handwritten greeting, sparkling wine and rose petals. We also adored our complementary, hearty breakfasts which we enjoyed either on our patio or in the restaurant area listening to Sade, the sweet waitress's preferred music choice.",

It truly offered a sense of seclusion and comfort.\n\nWhile the surrounding area is naturally spectacular, Mystique elevates the experience to pure bliss. Exceptional property, exceptional service.

It has one of the best prime location for Santorini and the view is just unparalleled on the island. The resort is beautiful! It only has 40 rooms and each one is unique. Throughout my 2 stays, i get to experience a few different room types and literally all of them were great, there is truly no bad room here. Each one is like a mini museum.\n\nService is excellent as always, special shoutout to Vaios, Yugita and Maria. I had wonderful conversations with them at different points during my stay and they made me felt very welcomed like a friend\n\nThis is truly Marriott Bonvoy's crown jewel in Greece.\nI hope you will choose this property, at least one night, to experience finer things in life. During my stay, I've come across several families having extended stay here in this resort, like upwards of 5 nights or more.\n\nExcellent property!",

The sunrise and sunset are out of this world from Veranda, their rooftop lounge. Sale up early and head up there for the best views. Breakfast and tapas were delicious. They help you set up reservations and anything you may need. Second Canaves location for us within 5 years and we would come back and stay there again.
