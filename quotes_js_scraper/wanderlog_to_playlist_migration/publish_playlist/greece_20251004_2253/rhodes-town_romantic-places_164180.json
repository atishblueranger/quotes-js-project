            "text": "Lindos Acropolis is a must-visit when on Rhodes. The combination of ancient ruins, dramatic cliffs and panoramic sea views is unforgettable. Tickets are 20 euros per adult and it's smart to buy them in advance to skip the line, we waited around 15 minutes. Along the way there are QR codes you can scan to buy tickets online, but if you're already close to the entrance, it might be quicker to just wait in line.\nThe path up is steep and not secured with handrails, so be careful, especially with kids. Wear good shoes and bring a hat or cap, as it gets very hot during the day. Once at the top, you're rewarded with stunning views over Lindos Bay and the white town below.\nThe site has some restored areas and informational signs. Go early if you want to avoid the crowds and the heat. A mix of history, nature and views that truly makes it one of the island's highlights. Worth every step.",

There are around 300 steps, and with the heat, it became quite a challenge. We had to stop for breaks several times, so make sure to bring water, wear proper shoes, and avoid the hottest part of the day if you can.\n\nThe monastery itself is small but peaceful and charming, with a serene atmosphere. There's a respectful dress code so remember to cover-up just in case.\n\nEven though the hike is tough, the view from the top makes it 100% worth it - perfect for taking photos and enjoying a quiet moment above the beach.",

The place is absolutely gorgeous, with stunning architecture that feels both historic and elegant. The small museum adds a nice cultural touch, and the on-site restaurant is lovely with great food and views.\n\nThe beach club was a highlight, so relaxing, with crystal-clear waters and the unique experience of swimming where natural spring water meets the sea. A perfect mix of history, beauty, and relaxation. Highly recommended!",

The prices were a little premium but not too bad.\n\nIf you like movie history you can find the shooting locations for several movies on the site.\n\nDespite reading the website and going there in person I'm still not sure where the spring actually springs from!",

I could've been there all day I think. €10 for adults and free for under 18s (maybe 21??) and moree than worth the price. Genuinely really miss it, wish I was there now.\n\nQuick warning however!! There are some rather uneven stairs with no handrails so if this is something you might struggle with I wouldn't say not to visit but I'd definitely say to be prepared for it. Not to call him out but my grandad stumbled on them and definitely could've hurt himself rather badly, we were lucky he was alright. Could happen to anyone, take care with those stairs",

Nestled in a lush, shaded gorge, this enchanting place is home to millions of butterflies during the summer months - a truly mesmerizing sight as they flutter among the trees, especially the beautiful Jersey tiger moths with their striking orange underwings.\n\nThe valley itself is a cool, peaceful escape from the heat, filled with winding paths, wooden bridges, waterfalls, and streams. The atmosphere is serene, with the sound of running water and rustling leaves accompanying you along the way. It's a nature lover's paradise and one of the most unique experiences on the island.\n\nBUT - be prepared! The walk is no joke. You'll be heading uphill and downhill quite a bit, so make sure to wear good sneakers and bring plenty of water, especially on hot days. There are lots of stairs and uneven terrain, but the effort is absolutely worth it for the views, the butterflies, and the overall experience.\n\nWhether you're into nature, photography, or just looking to enjoy something different and peaceful, Butterfly Valley is a must-visit. It's not just a tourist attraction - it's a natural wonder that leaves you in awe.\n\nTip: Go early in the day to avoid the crowds and catch the butterflies while they're most active.",

The trail consists of two stages: you walk through a gorge among trees and shrubs, along a stream, with the occasional small waterfall or pond. Wooden footbridges, benches to rest on, and the occasional butterfly create a pleasant atmosphere.\nHowever, the path goes uphill, with plenty of stone steps, so in 40°C heat (we had 49°C that day – we wanted to cool down) this activity is not for everyone. At the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the trail, there are toilet facilities (they cost €0.50 – a bit of a pity that it's not free when you eat in the restaurant or in the park), restaurants, and rest areas. We had a coffee, and it was okay.\nIn August 2025, the entrance fee is €6. You walk uphill in a crowd, on a stone path, and “admire” the charms of the valley. In my opinion, those charms are rather average. The price is adequate for the attraction. Worth a visit, but it's not on the TOP list for Rhodes.",

Wear comfortable shoes – it's a gentle hike but with some steps – and bring your camera, because every corner is a picture waiting to happen.\n\nA place where nature shows its most delicate side.

But tsambika beach is all sand!!\nAnd parking very easy.\nNice clear shallow water for little ones and older ones like my daddy.\nWe parked literally a stones throw from loungers( which are only €20 for 2 loungers and umbrella. Food and drink was also good value. Servers are there to take payment of loungers and food. Now if you drive you drive down long winding road, from main road tho beach must be a good mile walk, in heat, no joke!\nBut if you drive , there is lots of parking. Watch out for potholes at bottom and drive slow. I suggest take a right at bottom of hill.\nLovely sandy beach.",

The staff at the raccoon enclosure were excellent, and the ladies with the ostriches were very friendly and patient. We particularly recommend the lady (we've forgotten her name) at the lemur enclosure; she was incredibly professional and very encouraging with our three-year-old, who did wonderfully there. This is a must-visit place!",

It's wonderful to see that all the animals are safe, happy, cared for, and so loved by the staff. 🩷 We also had the rare opportunity to feed and play with the lemurs-something very few people get to do. I highly recommend it! You can't visit Rhodes without going to the Farma, or you'll miss out on a truly unique and wonderful experience! ⭐️",

You can see the care the staff give to the animals and how much this place means to them.\n\nWe visited a year ago and had to come back as it was a highlight of our holiday. The guides at each point are helpful and so knowledgeable however the lady who is the keeper in the lemur enclosure is just amazing. Her passion and love for the lemurs shine through and her knowledge is exceptional. She is an absolute credit to the farm.\n\nThe lemur experience is one I would tell everyone to do and is not one to be missed. My kids love it each time we have visited and always reflect back as one of their best times in rhodes.\n\nThere is also a lovely cafe with amazing milkshakes that the kids raved about. An amazing day out and one I would recommend over and over again. We will be back",

We snorkelled over to Anthony Quinn Bay which is better suited for adults only as it's rocky and not suitable for paddling. There is a ladder to get into the water. Many day cruise boats stop here for a quick snorkelling/swimming break.  There is a bar at Ladiko Bay but this time we had taken our own. Most people use water shoes.

It may be small but the rooms are big, very well cleaned (daily) with all the amenities you need. The aircon is a godsend given the heat whilst we stayed. Mr John and Nikos went out of their way to help with some lovely personal touches like collecting us from the town gates in a golf cart! The breakfast was lovely with plenty of coffee and it's taken in the courtyard.\nOverall one of the very best hotels I've stayed at, 10/10 I heartily recommend staying.",

Zacosta Villa Hotel is inside the medieval city (Old Town) which is an experience in itself!  The place is very cozy, well maintained, charming, and for a family of four with a 14 year ild and 12 year old, the room we got was perfect and has plenty of space!  The hotel has the historic look but with modern touches.  The room we got has a balcony as well which was a bonus.  The interior is a bit modern and has some nice touches to it.  There is a capsule coffee machine and they provide you with good coffee in capsules.  I love it!  They also provide bottled water and the replenish it daily.    There is a bar area at the property, although we did not get a chance to really use it but John the owner, told us that we can just grab\nwhat we want and just pay for it the next day if we come back late and decide we wanted to drink.  We did have shots of Ouzo as their nice farewell toast for us!  They serve breakfast every morning.  It is a simple selection but it was good enough for us to be fueled to start our day really good.\n\nThe location is perfect!  Everything is within walking distance!  It is a short walk to restaurants and shops.  We just walked within the walls and because it feels like you went back in time and we loved everything we saw. we did not even feel we walked many steps each day.\n\nWhat gave it a 5 stars are the people!  John (owner), his side kick, Nikkos who is now a friend, and the pleasant lady (I forgot her name) who always smiled as she set up and prepare the breakfast each day and also cleaned the room made our experience wonderful and memorable.  John provided us some great recommendations for places to dine and he was just so welcoming and very hospitable.  Nilkos helped us with everything we needed including a last minute car rental and we were able to try Ouzo for the first\ntime, which we loved.   We will mot look for any other place when we return to Rhodes, and we certainly will return!",

Demetrius was very helpful and gave us complimentary drinks as it was my Birthday.

So the next night came around and we went to see him.  He was delighted.  Up onto the rooftop we go for the next views. There was so much to choose from but we decided on as couple as you can see.  With a sparkle to come with it my wife was happy.  I can't remember the names of the one we had but I can say they were great.  Service was excellent. My only negative of this night was we were sitting next tow group that were smoking Shisha and it was disgusting smell which put a dampener on the night.

There is plenty of space and the wind is pretty good.\n\nIf you are not a beach boy the beach is also really nice. You can walk to the lighthouse on the other island. We walked over at 12pm. Please wear swim clothes the water on the Sandbank is not so deep. I'm 1.90m and on the deepest point I was only under water until my hips. So you can take easily a backpack with you. Please check before if your smartphone is out of your pocket.\n\nOn the island you can use normal walking shoes. It took us round about 40mins both ways.",
