But tsambika beach is all sand!!\nAnd parking very easy.\nNice clear shallow water for little ones and older ones like my daddy.\nWe parked literally a stones throw from loungers( which are only €20 for 2 loungers and umbrella. Food and drink was also good value. Servers are there to take payment of loungers and food. Now if you drive you drive down long winding road, from main road tho beach must be a good mile walk, in heat, no joke!\nBut if you drive , there is lots of parking. Watch out for potholes at bottom and drive slow. I suggest take a right at bottom of hill.\nLovely sandy beach.",

The cave and rock formations are so picturesque that you will enjoy taking photos. You can sit in the cave if you want to stay out from the sun. The sun beds and umbrella is 15 euros very reasonable compared to other beaches we did our research others were asking 25 to 30 euros way too much!

The beach has  pebbles, but they're small they don't bother you at all-just bring water shoes if you're extra sensitive. The water is crystal clear, perfect for swimming and snorkeling around the nearby caves and rock formations (don't miss exploring them!).\n\nThe vibe here is pure chillaxation-no crowds, just serene beauty. A pair of sunbeds and a parasol cost only €15. Getting here is easy too: take the bus, and it's just a 10-minute walk from the stop.\n\nThe Traganou Taverna nearby serves delicious, affordable food-the perfect post-beach feast or to grab an ice cold beer or a coffee. They have a great barisrta.\n\nHands down, this was the best beach day of my life! Highly recommend for anyone visiting Rhodes. 💙",

If you are driving, search ratjer for Ladiko Bay which is the same  thing. Yes, it's busy but not over crowded. The water is magical. We snorkelled over to Anthony Quinn Bay which is better suited for adults only as it's rocky and not suitable for paddling. There is a ladder to get into the water. Many day cruise boats stop here for a quick snorkelling/swimming break.  There is a bar at Ladiko Bay but this time we had taken our own. Most people use water shoes. Considering how windy it was in Faliraki,  the Bay was quite sheltered.",

If you would like to get some sunbeds the sets range from 10 euros to 120 so there's something for everyone. The beach bars have the luxurious sunbeds with prices starting from 35 euros depending on how far they are from the water and depending on the bar of course. Pebbles cover the whole beach meaning the water is more clear and when it hets windy there's no dust to get in your eyes. And it can get very windy in Rhodes. You can get food at the local bars and restaurants and there's lots to choose from, though prices are usual high for Greek standards overall. Because it get so windy it feels comfortable in the sun and the heat is much more bearable, however that could fool you into staying in the sun longer and getting a sunburn without even feeling/noticing it so do be mindful of that. There's also a platform about 20 meyers from the shore where you can jump into the water from 3 different height levels. Once you get into the water it get deep pretty quick so after just a few meters the depth gets to about 2 meters. There's lots of big rocks in the water, some seaweed/sea grass and a few different types of fish making it fun for snorkeling and diving. One thing to watch out for is the sea current as it can change pretty fast especially in deeper water, so do stay within the designated area/line.",

Both the service and quality exceeded our expectations.\nThe restaurant offerings were exceptional. From breakfast to cocktails, every item was prepared with care, featuring balanced flavors and fresh ingredients. The staff were attentive, frequently checking in to ensure we were enjoying our time.\nThe sea was crystal clear, and snorkeling around the rocks to observe various fish added an entirely new dimension to our day.

This is not just a beach - it's a portal to stillness, a place the soul reaches before the body does.\n\nThe path to Fourni winds through fragrant pine forest, as if leading you to a secret shore known only to a lucky few. Then suddenly - the horizon opens, and there it is: a wild, untouched bay, painted by the brushstrokes of wind and sunlight. The sea here is different - deep, rich, indigo blue, as if it has absorbed all the light of the passing day.\n\nThe cliffs surrounding the beach stand like ancient guardians, protecting this pocket of peace. The pebbles underfoot are smooth and warm, shaped by centuries of dancing waves. You don't feel like playing music here. You don't speak loudly. You listen to the wind, breathe in salt and pine, and let yourself simply exist.\n\nFourni is for those who seek not just solitude, but a return to something within. It's easy to imagine ancient gods swimming in these waters, or muses whispering lines of poetry to travelers stunned by the view.\n\nAnd the sunset - it feels like legend. The sea falls still, the sky turns to watercolor, and everything breathes in harmony - slowly, deeply, lovingly.",

The water is crystal-clear and warm, ideal for swimming, snorkeling, or just floating under the sun. The beach is long and spacious, with both lively spots full of music and activities, and quieter areas perfect for relaxing.\n\nThere are plenty of sunbeds and umbrellas for rent, and the beach is very clean and well-maintained. We loved how close everything was-restaurants, beach bars, shops, and even water sports stations. The staff at the local cafes were super friendly and prices were reasonable.\n\nWhether you're looking for a family day out, a romantic sunset walk, or fun with friends, Faliraki Beach has something for everyone. Highly recommend visiting if you're in Rhodes!",

The food was decent, and despite the overwhelming crowd, the staff remained attentive and kind, which we really appreciated.\n\nWhile the service was good and the food was okay, I wouldn't choose to come back due to how overcrowded it gets.

The road is a rocky path so you do need to drive slowly, we were in a rental car and found it perfectly fine. I advise people to  either park on the side of the road or a little away from the proposed parking by the olive tree as there are goats and they do climb the cars. There are 2 beaches when you reach the bays one to the left has simple steps to step down and red sand beach on the right has a small bit of scrambling. We didn't see any rope to use to get down as previously mentioned in other however no rope was needed at. The beach is signposted with small blue plaques saying Antonio. Once you reach the bays there is a rock with red sand beach painted on it. The only thing we found difficult about the small trek is the steepness of the hill back to the car but it is a winding path that takes less than 10 minutes. We went at around 3pm and had the beach on the left to ourselves. Plenty to see snorkelling, beautiful clear water and it was great watching the goats climbing the cliffs. Plenty of shade where we were, bring plenty of water as there are no shops.",

The water is crystal clear, and like a millpond most of the time!\n\nThe accommodation itself was great - it's the bottom floor of a three storey detached property (there was no noise from above!), with two bedrooms - one double (air conditioned), one twin, plus a decent sized bathroom with modern toilet/sink/shower, and an air-conditioned kitchen/dining/living space. (The bedrooms and bathroom look too have been recently modernised - some of the photos on here are clearly old!)\n\nThere's a spacious sun terrace at the front, accessed through sliding patio doors from the living area, complete with four chairs and a patio table - it overlooks a 'boardwalk' that runs along the length of the bay - and a small terrace at the rear with a washing machine and drying rack, perfect for drying towels and swimwear.\n\nParking at the nearby hotel is included, with plenty of spaces, and the host Maria (Stefanos' mother) met us to hand over the keys and give us a quick tour.\n\nThere is a restaurant and mini-market three doors down, which was great, and there are more restaurants further along the bay in easy walking distance. All the food we had was great!",
