The room came with an outdoor jacuzzi in the balcony, with views of the sunset and the caldera! We had a lavish breakfast spread included in our room charge.\n\nThe staff were very warm and friendly. They make you feel so welcome.\n\nYou also get to visit the sister property, Aspaki by Art Maison which has a coveted view of the blue domes. No one else had it booked it so we had a nice romantic sunset just to ourselves!\n\nBoth the properties have breathtaking views",

Thalia, one of the managers, was phenomenal. She is kind, thoughtful, and genuine. Without us asking, she helped us with our daily plans, arranged cabs, arranged for card payments when we were low on cash, called up restaurants for confirmations and cancellations - she tied up our entire stay with a neat bow.\n\nConstantina served us breakfast. She is lovely - friendly, warm and charming. She taught me some basic Greek words that I still remember (and hope to for a long time).\n\nThey picked us up, brought our luggage in from our previous hotel upon check-in, and dropped it off at our next hotel (after check-out). I didn't catch the name of our porter - but I know it's a hard job carrying luggage up and down those Oia steps, so thank you!\n\nThey offered a lovely complimentary drink on arrival. There was a complimentary bottle of champagne in the room with some petite sweets.\n\nEverything was better than we had expected! I strongly recommend this place.",

Highly recommend and we will be back.",
