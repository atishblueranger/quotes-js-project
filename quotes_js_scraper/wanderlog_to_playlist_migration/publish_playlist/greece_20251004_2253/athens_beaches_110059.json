Ugly tattered by the wind, disintegrating plastic taupes put up by people on metal frames for shade from the sun are an eyesore. Nice for a quick swim or snorkel. A bit ugly when looking inland from the water. Is not your tranquil holiday escape for sure and is by far not a very beautiful place even though photos might suggest. I still came most days on my visit as it's not too bad.",
