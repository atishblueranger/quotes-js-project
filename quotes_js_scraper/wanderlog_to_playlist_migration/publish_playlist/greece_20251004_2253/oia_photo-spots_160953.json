The advantage of Oia is that we have 3 blue domes close to each other, and that makes a great backdrop :)\n\nIf you are not staying at Oia, be prepared to park the car at the entrance of Oia and walk to the Blue Domes. It's a decent walk with some elevation.\n\nBe prepared for ques at all famous spots for selfies. Luckily, I was staying some 20 meters from the domes, so I had the luxury to go early in the morning and late at night and take as many pics as I wanted without being in line :D",
