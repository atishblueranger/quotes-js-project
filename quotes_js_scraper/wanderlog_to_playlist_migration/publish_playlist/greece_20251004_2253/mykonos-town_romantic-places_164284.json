He is someone that is passionate about their job and goes the extra mile beyond just getting you drinks and food to ensure you have a great time. He was very attentive, brought positive high energy, was engaging, and would even recognize when the group was feeling a bit low energy and help by making us laugh, getting us to dance, and bringing over complimentary shots. The food was well-portioned and tasty. The drinks were top notch. The live dancers were a nice touch to get the dance floor going to transition the daytime beach to sundown party vibe. The DJ was fun and we had fun dancing. This beach club is on the pricier side but felt it offered a wide variety of high quality entertainment from beach lounging, partying, dancing, and eating. The towels, sun beds and cabanas were worth it and allowed us to enjoy the beach from morning to night.",

You can see the results, not a single person did so and I had a lot of time to change my spots and play with sun. Go there between 6:00 and 6:30 and skip the crowds and boring daily photos with tens of other people. I am not a photographer, I just wanted to try my luck to wake up earlier and every day there were not a single individual. And those mills are simply stunning",

During August, many couples and even groups of friends were turned away at the door. Things are a bit more relaxed in September.\n\nWe've tried the restaurant in the past, but this year we focused on the sunset party experience, which was fantastic. Delicious cocktails, great music, and an unbeatable vibe.\n\nHighly recommended if you're looking for a premium party experience on the island.\n\nPrices:\n•\tCocktails: €23–€25\n•\tChampagne: from €40/glass and up\n•\tDesserts: €28–€42\n\nOther details:\n•\tThe toilets were clean and well-serviced.\n•\tDress code: white is highly encouraged for an elegant look.",

It sets the rhythm of the entire experience, starting slow and soulful during the day, then gradually building into deep, hypnotic beats as the sun goes down. It moves through you and creates a connection between the people, the space and the sea. It's more than a soundtrack – it's the heartbeat of the place.\n\nThe food is fresh, delicious and beautifully presented. The seafood dishes are a must. Everything we tried was full of flavour and felt light, clean and nourishing. Service was warm, present and smooth from start to finish.\n\nEvery time I'm in Mykonos, Scorpios is a must.

You can tell they use high quality ingredients and put care into every dish.\n\nThe staff were genuinely warm and friendly, always checking in with a smile and happy to make recommendations. Service was fast but never rushed, and we felt really looked after from start to finish.\n\nIt's the kind of place that gets everything right without trying too hard. Great food, lovely service and a charming location all come together for a memorable dining experience.

A heartfelt bravo to Katerina, the lovely owner, whose warmth and hospitality make this place so special.\nHighly recommended – I'll definitely be back. Tomorrow :)!",

The place transforms into a lively hotspot with the rhythm of music filling the air, creating an irresistible party vibe. The music is upbeat, setting the tone for an unforgettable evening.\n\nThe food is just as impressive as the vibe. Whether you're in the mood for a light bite or a full-on feast, Kalua delivers! Fresh seafood, delicious Greek dishes, and tasty cocktails that perfectly complement the beach setting. The portions are generous, and the quality of ingredients speaks for itself - everything tastes as good as it looks.\n\nBut what truly sets Kalua apart is the live entertainment.

And don't get me started on the dancers - they absolutely own the stage. With their lively choreography, they bring the place to life and get everyone on their feet, dancing along to the rhythm.\n\nWould definitely go there again.",

As for the movie itself, it was nothing short of amazing, captivating us from beginning to end. The entire venue exuded a charming and adorable ambiance, making it stand out amidst the beauty of the entire island of Mykonos.\n\nOne particular highlight was the presence of a serene fish pond located adjacent to the canteen. Its presence added a touch of tranquility and enhanced the overall ambiance of the place. Additionally, the cinema cleverly included an intermission during the movie, which I found to be a valuable feature. This break provided an opportunity to stretch our legs, grab some snacks, and refresh ourselves, ultimately enhancing the cinema experience.\n\nOverall, this unique cinema experience was truly remarkable, setting itself apart from the rest of Mykonos Island's attractions.",

From start to finish, Nick was incredibly professional, attentive, and accommodating, ensuring that every detail was perfect.\n\nThe photos themselves were simply stunning. Nick has a remarkable talent for capturing moments and emotions, and the final images exceeded all my expectations. The lighting, composition, and attention to detail in each shot were exceptional, resulting in a collection of photos that I will cherish for years to come.\n\nI highly recommend Nick for anyone looking for a talented and professional photographer in Mykonos.
