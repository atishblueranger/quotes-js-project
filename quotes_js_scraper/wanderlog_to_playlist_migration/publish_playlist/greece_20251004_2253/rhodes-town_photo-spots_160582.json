All I can say is that among all the acropolis that survived the test of time, this is probably a top contender for the title of Acropolis with the best views!",

Tickets are 20 euros per adult and it's smart to buy them in advance to skip the line, we waited around 15 minutes. Along the way there are QR codes you can scan to buy tickets online, but if you're already close to the entrance, it might be quicker to just wait in line.\nThe path up is steep and not secured with handrails, so be careful, especially with kids. Wear good shoes and bring a hat or cap, as it gets very hot during the day. Once at the top, you're rewarded with stunning views over Lindos Bay and the white town below.\nThe site has some restored areas and informational signs. Go early if you want to avoid the crowds and the heat. A mix of history, nature and views that truly makes it one of the island's highlights. Worth every step.",

Walking through the stone pathways feels like stepping back in time, while still offering plenty of opportunities for shopping and browsing.\nMost of the shops sell similar products, ranging from souvenirs and clothing to local crafts and jewelry. Prices can vary quite a bit from one store to another, so it is worth comparing before you buy. Another tip: many shopkeepers offer a better deal if you pay in cash rather than by card, so it's a good idea to keep some cash with you.\nOverall, the Old Town combines history, charm, and a lively shopping experience, making it a must-visit during your stay in Rhodes.",

Steepish climb up, but easily doable, you'd want decent shoes on. Nice little cafe at the bottom. But tight on parking but we found a spot easy enough. No charge to park or enter.\nDrive over is pleasant winding through the mountains. Very glad we made the effort to come",

The atmosphere is lively, and the water is crystal clear, making it an ideal location for a day of relaxation. The bar offers a variety of refreshing cocktails and snacks, perfect for enjoying under the sun. While the sunbeds may be on the expensive side, the experience of lounging by the water makes it worth the splurge. Families and friends often gather here, adding to the cheerful vibe of the place. If you're looking for a fun day out, this spot is definitely worth considering.",

If you just want to wander around for an hour that's all you need.\n\nDeck chairs, sun beds or kabanas are extra, ranging from €20 to €120. I felt this could have been clearer on the website. There's a couple of bars. The prices were a little premium but not too bad.\n\nIf you like movie history you can find the shooting locations for several movies on the site.\n\nDespite reading the website and going there in person I'm still not sure where the spring actually springs from!",

I could've been there all day I think. €10 for adults and free for under 18s (maybe 21??) and moree than worth the price. Genuinely really miss it, wish I was there now.\n\nQuick warning however!! There are some rather uneven stairs with no handrails so if this is something you might struggle with I wouldn't say not to visit but I'd definitely say to be prepared for it.

There are around 300 steps, and with the heat, it became quite a challenge. We had to stop for breaks several times, so make sure to bring water, wear proper shoes, and avoid the hottest part of the day if you can.\n\nThe monastery itself is small but peaceful and charming, with a serene atmosphere. There's a respectful dress code so remember to cover-up just in case.\n\nEven though the hike is tough, the view from the top makes it 100% worth it - perfect for taking photos and enjoying a quiet moment above the beach.",

Her passion and love for the lemurs shine through and her knowledge is exceptional. She is an absolute credit to the farm.\n\nThe lemur experience is one I would tell everyone to do and is not one to be missed. My kids love it each time we have visited and always reflect back as one of their best times in rhodes.\n\nThere is also a lovely cafe with amazing milkshakes that the kids raved about.

The staff are absolutely wonderful – so friendly and passionate about what they do. They even give the animals names, which makes the whole experience feel much more personal and heartwarming.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was being able to feed the lemurs – such a fun and unique experience!

Nestled in a lush, shaded gorge, this enchanting place is home to millions of butterflies during the summer months - a truly mesmerizing sight as they flutter among the trees, especially the beautiful Jersey tiger moths with their striking orange underwings.\n\nThe valley itself is a cool, peaceful escape from the heat, filled with winding paths, wooden bridges, waterfalls, and streams. The atmosphere is serene, with the sound of running water and rustling leaves accompanying you along the way. It's a nature lover's paradise and one of the most unique experiences on the island.\n\nBUT - be prepared! The walk is no joke. You'll be heading uphill and downhill quite a bit, so make sure to wear good sneakers and bring plenty of water, especially on hot days. There are lots of stairs and uneven terrain, but the effort is absolutely worth it for the views, the butterflies, and the overall experience.\n\nWhether you're into nature, photography, or just looking to enjoy something different and peaceful, Butterfly Valley is a must-visit. It's not just a tourist attraction - it's a natural wonder that leaves you in awe.\n\nTip: Go early in the day to avoid the crowds and catch the butterflies while they're most active.",

            "text": "When it comes to nature on Rhodes, this is indeed an interesting valley. The trail consists of two stages: you walk through a gorge among trees and shrubs, along a stream, with the occasional small waterfall or pond. Wooden footbridges, benches to rest on, and the occasional butterfly create a pleasant atmosphere.\nHowever, the path goes uphill, with plenty of stone steps, so in 40°C heat (we had 49°C that day – we wanted to cool down) this activity is not for everyone. At the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the trail, there are toilet facilities (they cost €0.50 – a bit of a pity that it's not free when you eat in the restaurant or in the park), restaurants, and rest areas. We had a coffee, and it was okay.\nIn August 2025, the entrance fee is €6. You walk uphill in a crowd, on a stone path, and “admire” the charms of the valley. In my opinion, those charms are rather average. The price is adequate for the attraction. Worth a visit, but it's not on the TOP list for Rhodes.",

Wear comfortable shoes – it's a gentle hike but with some steps – and bring your camera, because every corner is a picture waiting to happen.\n\nA place where nature shows its most delicate side.

From the top of the ruin you have an impressive view into the bay and the small islands in the vicinity. On a clear day you can see the coastline of Turkey in the distance. In the public section there is no roof structure left, so in the very unlikely event of rainfall you would not have any meaningful cover. Great that this precious spot is free of charge.",

The road leading up to the site is mostly tarmac and fairly accessible, with just a few short but steep sections near the top. Our small rental car managed it with no issues.\n\nThere's a free car park right by the castle that can hold around 15 cars, which was a nice bonus. Entry to the ruins is also free, accessed via a set of built steps. Just a note – not suitable for a wheelchair access, unfortunately.\n\nOnce you reach the top, the views are absolutely breathtaking and make the short trek well worth it. We also noticed a small café nearby, but we didn't stop in so can't comment on the food or service.\n\nOverall, it's a great little stop if you're exploring the island – highly recommended if you've got an hour to spare and fancy a bita bit of history paired with stunning scenery.",

Perfectly preserved and hauntingly beautiful, this cobbled thoroughfare-once the ceremonial heart of the Knights Hospitaller-remains one of the most evocative streets in all of Europe.\n\nLined with austere yet majestic stone façades, each auberge tells a silent tale of the Order's different Langues, or tongues-representing the various nations of the knights. The architecture is sober, noble, and powerful, just like the ideals the knights professed to defend. As you ascend slowly toward the Palace of the Grand Master, each step seems to echo with history.\n\nThere are no neon signs here, no tourist traps cluttering the view-just the hush of centuries under your feet and above your head. The street rewards those who walk it slowly, who look up, and who listen carefully.\n\nTo visit Rhodes without walking this street would be to visit Venice and miss the canals, or Cairo and skip the pyramids. It's not just a place-it's an experience of time carved in stone.",

The cave and rock formations are so picturesque that you will enjoy taking photos. You can sit in the cave if you want to stay out from the sun. The sun beds and umbrella is 15 euros very reasonable compared to other beaches we did our research others were asking 25 to 30 euros way too much! You are more than welcome to bring a packed lunch or enjoy the restaurant which has great food!",

The beach has  pebbles, but they're small they don't bother you at all-just bring water shoes if you're extra sensitive. The water is crystal clear, perfect for swimming and snorkeling around the nearby caves and rock formations (don't miss exploring them!).\n\nThe vibe here is pure chillaxation-no crowds, just serene beauty. A pair of sunbeds and a parasol cost only €15. Getting here is easy too: take the bus, and it's just a 10-minute walk from the stop.\n\nThe Traganou Taverna nearby serves delicious, affordable food-the perfect post-beach feast or to grab an ice cold beer or a coffee. They have a great barisrta.\n\nHands down, this was the best beach day of my life! Highly recommend for anyone visiting Rhodes. 💙",

The actual temple was under restoration and was covered in scaffolding but honestly the rest made up for it all. Beautiful stadium, theatre and all around layout. Most sites don't mention that there's also a temple to Artemis besides the one to Apollo which was the one with scaffolding so that was a really pleasant surprise. Amazing views from the top too. MAKE SURE YOU KNOW HOW TO GET THERE 😭😭 the signs are super misleading. There was loads of signs inside through with some sick information so I was loving that.",

            "text": "Step Back in Time – Exploring the Acropolis of Rhodes and Surrounding Ancient Wonders\n\nVisiting the Acropolis of Rhodes is like walking through a portal into ancient history. Perched on Monte Smith hill and surrounded by greenery, the site is a treasure trove of remarkable ruins, each whispering stories from over 2,300 years ago.\n\nStart your journey with the Olympic Stadium, beautifully preserved and still echoing the spirit of ancient athleticism. You can almost picture the competitions that once took place here. Just a short walk away, you'll find the small but impressive Odeon, a Roman-era theater that once hosted music and poetry performances – it's a peaceful spot that brings the grandeur of the past to life.\n\nThe crown jewel, of course, is the Temple of Apollo, with its tall columns standing proudly against the sky. Though partially restored, the site still evokes the sacred atmosphere of classical worship. As you explore further, you'll come across scattered ruins, columns, and steps that once formed temples, sanctuaries, and public spaces - all part of the ancient city's rich tapestry.\n\nBesides the historical significance, the views from the hilltop are absolutely stunning. Overlooking the sea and the modern town of Rhodes, it's a perfect mix of natural beauty and cultural depth. Don't be surprised if you lose track of time - there's something new to admire around every corner.\n\nA few tips:\n•\tWear comfortable sneakers – the paths are uneven, and you'll be doing a fair bit of walking.\n•\tBring plenty of water, especially in summer – shade is limited, and the sun can be intense.\n•\tA camera is a must – both for the ruins and the sweeping panoramic views.\n\nIn short: This area is a must-see for history lovers, architecture buffs, or anyone who wants to experience the soul of ancient Greece. It's not just a sightseeing spot - it's an experience that transports you centuries into the past. Don't miss it while you're in Rhodes!",

            "text": "⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nThe Acropolis of Rhodes (Monte Smith) is an impressive historical site with many layers of history. 🏛️ You can explore the Temple of Apollo, the ancient stadium, and the restored theater, all set in a beautiful landscape with wide views over Rhodes and the sea. 🌅\n\nHowever, some parts of what you see today were reconstructed during the Italian occupation in the 1930s. The Italians tried to “recreate” ancient Rhodes, but often used wrong methods and modern materials like concrete, which doesn't reflect the original look or technique. 🏗️ While it helped preserve parts of the site, it also makes some reconstructions appear inauthentic.\n\nStill, the place is full of atmosphere and well worth visiting, there's a lot to discover and to learn about the island's layered history. 📜",
