The road leading up to the site is mostly tarmac and fairly accessible, with just a few short but steep sections near the top. Our small rental car managed it with no issues.\n\nThere's a free car park right by the castle that can hold around 15 cars, which was a nice bonus. Entry to the ruins is also free, accessed via a set of built steps. Just a note – not suitable for a wheelchair access, unfortunately.\n\nOnce you reach the top, the views are absolutely breathtaking and make the short trek well worth it. We also noticed a small café nearby, but we didn't stop in so can't comment on the food or service.\n\nOverall, it's a great little stop if you're exploring the island – highly recommended if you've got an hour to spare and fancy a bita bit of history paired with stunning scenery.",
