We chose to explore on our own and found it to be a fantastic experience ( we really enjoy castles already and have seen many) but this one was fairly well preserved with many labels. It also includes a museum of a couple shipwrecks that have been partially re constructed which were truly fascinating.  ( Ill say no to buying tickets in advance because it was simple to do with a Visa or Mastercard at the entrance otherwise you must use Turkish Lira currency)",

The grounds, museum and setting inside the castle takes you back to life in the country so many years ago. Definitely visit if you are in the Bodrum area. Very less crowds also, so you can really spend some time by yourself. Also, the photos of the harbour from the castle walls will come out so good!",
