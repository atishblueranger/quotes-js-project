From its different levels, you get a full 360° view that captures the vast beauty of Istanbul. I personally took videos and photos from the balconies, and the views are truly breathtaking.\n\nKeep in mind that the balconies are quite narrow, and many people will be trying to do the same thing as you-taking pictures and enjoying the view. Patience and kindness go a long way here; it's the only way everyone gets a fair chance to capture their moments.\n\nThere are viewfinders at the top that let you zoom in on specific points of the city. You take an elevator to the top, and there's also a spiral staircase if you prefer to walk down.\n\nLike most tourist attractions in Istanbul, it's always busy-not overwhelmingly crowded, but consistently full of people. Still, it's absolutely worth it.\n\nWhat makes the experience even better is that right outside the tower, there's a charming street filled with cafés and restaurants where you can have breakfast or lunch while enjoying a beautiful view of the tower itself. A perfect mix of history, architecture, and local flavor.\n\nTheir gift shop has wonderful souvenirs!\nI entered with the multi-museum access card.",

The price for me was too high, including the fact that you can't enter the palace twice (it so happened that I had to leave the palace, and when I tried to go back, they didn't let me in, saying that I was already inside, no explanation helped me). I was also surprised that you can't take pictures inside, there are guards following you who are annoyingly watching so that you don't take out your phone, it was stressful. Tickets can be bought on the spot, standing in a small queue. There are no benches to relax on the territory, but there are 2 cafes.\nTip for photo lovers: do not wait in line at the first gate from the exit of the palace, there are 3 more such gates along the fence (slightly smaller but without a queue)",

The palace is located in the same area as Hagia Sophia, Blue Mosque, and Grand Bazaar, so it's convenient to visit other historical places, if you had time.\n\nTicket:\nWe visited in June 2025 and paid 2,400₺ per person for the Topkapi palace ticket. This included access to:\n\n• Topkapi Palace\n• Harem Apartments\n• Hagia Irene Monument Mueseum\n• Topkapi Palace and Harem Apartments\n• Clock and Weapon Museum\n• Audio Guide Device (ID card needed to get)\n\nThe palace is a large complex with different museum areas inside a big garden. There are several sections showing Ottoman-era clothing, jewelry, weapons, kitchenware, diplomatic gifts, and more. The Harem Apartments are a separate section and worth visiting for their architecture and more private royal spaces.\n\nTo get the audio guide, you need to provide an ID card at the counter, which they hold until you return the device after your visit. The guide is helpful, especially if you're visiting multiple areas.\n\nTip:\nGo early in the morning. There's a lot to see, and if you start late, you may not be able to visit everything. Also, there are plenty of good photo spots.\n\nOverall, the ticket price is reasonable for the amount of access it provides, and the visit is well worth it.",

It offers a very different kind of experience - dark, mysterious, and beautifully lit with soft reflections on the water. The ancient columns and lighting create a dramatic setting, and the Medusa head statue at the end adds a mystical touch that leaves a lasting impression.\n\nThe site is well-maintained, and the staff were courteous and helpful throughout. However, one thing to note - it's not stroller-friendly. There are stairs to go down and no ramp, so carrying a stroller by hand can be quite difficult, especially if you're visiting with kids. It would be great if better accessibility options were provided.\n\nOther than that, it's a fascinating and historic spot that I'd definitely recommend if you're in the Sultanahmet area.",

            "text": "The Basilica Cistern is certainly an atmospheric and unique site to visit, but there are a few things worth knowing before you go. First and foremost, I would strongly recommend buying tickets in advance. On the day we visited, the ticket queue stretched for around two and a half hours, and staff did not manage the line particularly well, which caused confusion and frustration for many visitors; particularly given the complete lack of shade. Inside, the space is undeniably impressive - vast marble columns rising from the water and the famous Medusa head tucked away in a corner create a dramatic and almost otherworldly setting. However, the experience is let down by the lack of information. Guards usher people through quite quickly, so there is not always enough time to stop and read the few plaques available. For this reason, I would recommend paying extra for the audio guide, as without it you gain very little understanding of the history or significance of what you are looking at.\n\nGiven the price of admission and the scale of the crowds, the overall value feels questionable. The cistern itself is fascinating, but the presentation does not match the potential of the site. Some improvements - such as projecting short films or historical reconstructions onto the walls, or including a basic audio track with the ticket - could make the visit much more engaging and worthwhile. As it stands, it is worth seeing once, but don't expect a relaxed or informative experience unless you plan ahead.",

One particularly unforgettable moment was standing at the edge of the boat, feeling the wind on my face as I admired the glittering skyline. It was a moment of pure bliss and connection with the city. The Istanbul Bosphorus sunset cruise was a highlight of my trip, offering an evening filled with beauty, culture, and enjoyment.

After living in Turkey for three years and trying countless kebabs, l can confidently say this place still stands out.\nThe Adana kebab in the mixed platter had no unpleasant smell and was perfectly seasoned, while the beef in the Testi kebab was incredibly tender and flavorful, almost reminiscent of braised short ribs. The portion sizes and quality of the food remain consistent, and the staff continues to provide friendly and attentive service. The interior is also nicely decorated, creating a comfortable and pleasant dining atmosphere.\nBe sure to make a reservation.",

It's not a huge museum - but wow, every inch is packed with beauty, detail, and history.\n\nThe rooms are like scenes from a lost era. Breathtaking furniture, man-made masterpieces in the form of chairs, tables, curtains, even the carpets - every element speaks luxury and craftsmanship. The walls and ceilings are adorned with delicate drawings, and the lighting, the fabrics, the placement of each item… it all feels intentional and poetic.\n\nEach room is labeled, with little sentences or quotes that give it a personal touch, as if the museum is whispering stories to you. And although there are guards everywhere, they're polite and don't hover too much. Photography is technically forbidden - but let's be honest, most of us still managed to sneak a few shots. Too pretty not to!\n\nBecause it's not a massive space, you don't feel exhausted - the visit is smooth and fast-paced, especially since it gets a bit crowded with school tours. But it's clean, organized, and never boring. After the museum, you can stroll through the peaceful garden outside, with trees and a fountain that just beg you to sit and breathe it all in.\n\nOne downside? The prices around the museum are no joke. I paid 200 lira for one cookie - felt more like robbery than dessert. If you're on a budget, better walk a bit farther out to grab food or snacks.\n\nStill, the experience was magical. I'd go again in a heartbeat, and I definitely recommend it - especially with its spot right by the coast. Watching the ships and boats glide across the water just adds to the charm. History, beauty, and a sea breeze? Yes, please.",

The view from the top is stunning, and the cute little church is a must-see. Plus, it's free, which makes it even better. Highly recommended when you're on the island!\n\nP.S. The church closes at 16:00, so make sure to get there before it closes. Also, if you're taking the island buses, keep in mind that each way costs about 65TL. On the way back to the island center, there aren't any ticket machines to recharge your transport card, so make sure you've got enough money on it for both directions. And don't forget to bring water, sunscreen, and a hat for the road!",

We booked the trip without dinner, and the tour cost us 150 TL per adult, with our 4-year-old child joining us free of charge.\n\nOverall, we had a nice experience exploring Istanbul from the sea, both on the European and Asian sides. The view of Istanbul was amazing during the trip, and we appreciated the opportunity to see the city from a different perspective. However, we did notice that the boats were not well equipped with all the necessary safety measures for young children. As a result, I have rated the tour a 4 out of 5.\n\nI wanted to bring this to your attention as I believe it's important to ensure the safety of all passengers on board. Perhaps in the future, you could consider providing additional safety equipment or implementing stricter safety guidelines to ensure that all passengers, including young children, are safe during the tour.",

The food was tasty, although the pasta was a bit too rich. We ordered pasta and a burger, and both were good. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. As a tourist spot, I will definitely return.",

We ordered the Main course as for The Duck Dumpling and The Fish Stew . It was cooked to ”juicy perfection” and the desserts we had (I can't remember the name) like, it was Baklava Fusion, oh is  a Heavenly!! Don't even get me started on,\nAlso, you always can check the best wine pair food with the staff or their bartender as well.\n\nWe eat them every day if I could (as we are a big foodie traveler). Shoutout to the staff for being professional hospitable and attentive.  As I also someone who worked and had experience for 15 years in Hospitality Industry.",

We had the set menu. 8 appetizers which you have to share with your partner ( not sure what happens if you go by yourself). One main course and a desert. It is quite filling. About $150 US dollars each.\nThe sore point that we had an obnoxious waiter who was very mean which made our entire experience bad. The manager was quite nice and tried to fix the issue, but I wouldn't go back because of that guy with the pony tail. He let the dish on the table and was busy with other guests and did not even give us cutlery.\nOverall good food, enjoy you may not get the same guy.",

A huge thanks to the owners of the club for organising such a beautiful night!\nAbout the place: the entrance fee is 800TL. The food is just your standard pub food, nothing fancy, but on a more expensive range of the spectrum. We heard loads of people complimenting cocktails, but we had beer. 290TL per draft Efes.\nThere is a show on each night, except for Sundays, you can look at their website to see the programme.\nI highly recommend visiting this place, your soul will thank you!",

The Slow Cooked Beef Short Rib was particularly delectable, with its tender and melt-in-your-mouth texture. The Bolet Mushroom was also flavorful and creamy. The service was exceptional, and the city views were breathtaking. I highly recommend the tasting menu to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience.",

Loved everything about this restaurant and can easily see why it's been listed on the The World's 50 Best Restaurant for a number of years and hasa  Michelin star! The setting: the top of The Marmara Pera (conveniently just went down a floor after a sneaky pre drinks at the rooftop bar). In the midst of jasmine scents accompanied by the refreshing breeze of Galata I take in breathtaking views shimmering in the setting sun where old mosques glow like gold crowns! It's impossible not to feel romanced by Istanbul!\n\nThe food here is innovatively delish! The menu combines contemporary techniques with traditional Anatolian recipes heroing fresh local produce from every corner of Anatolia to create beautiful dishes reflects the traditions of Anatolia's lands and people. I went with the 3 course a la carte menu and loved everything I ordered! My fave was the Seafood Casserole. The seafood was ocean fresh and the stew was a flavour bomb! 💣😋 Loved the spice kick it had too! The smoked duck was tasty too! Balanced really well with the sourness of the cherry in the salad and the pepper ham and white bean hummus! Desert was quite the sweet treat! Got the Burnt Hazelnut Halva loved the light creaminess of the rice pudding  and the refreshing kaffir lime hazelnut sorbet! Was super impressed by the 3 courses of complementary snacks too which really showcased creative modern flair to traditional flavours! 😍",
