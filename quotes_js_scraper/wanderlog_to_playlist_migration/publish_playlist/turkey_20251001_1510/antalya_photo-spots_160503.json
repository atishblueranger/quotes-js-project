Entry prices vary for locals and foreigners, which might catch some off guard, but it's understandable and helps keep sites like this affordable for residents. The waterfall itself is stunning, with lush greenery and a peaceful atmosphere. One of the highlights is the cave that runs behind the waterfall. It's such a unique experience to walk through and see the water cascading from behind. However, if you're tall or have mobility issues, be cautious. The cave has some low ceilings and uneven steps that can be tricky. Still, it's an amazing natural site that's definitely worth checking out. Whether you're a local or a visitor, it's a relaxing and memorable way to spend an afternoon.",

This is my second visit since settling in Antalya for a month. The park left a lasting impression the first time, but today, it feels especially lush and vibrant.\n\nThe sky was clear, and the trees were full of life. The Mediterranean shimmered in transparent hues, and the distant Olympos Mountain stood majestically like a painting. The park exuded an air of serenity. Many locals sat perched on the rocky outcrops, gazing at the sea, lost in thought. Some sat in silence, deep in contemplation, while others exchanged quiet conversations in hushed tones.\n\nOn the way to the park, the weekend market added to the charm of the stroll. From cheese and honey to an array of colorful Turkish desserts, the market was brimming with delicacies. The sweet aroma of treats wafted through the air as locals skillfully selected their desired goods with familiarity and care. Simply walking through the lively market, taking in the sights and scents, made the experience even more delightful.\n\nThe walking paths here are filled with peace and happiness. It's a place where one can step away from the demands of daily life and reconnect with oneself. Breathing in the fresh air, I am reminded of the beauty in life's simple pleasures. Today, Karaalioğlu Parkı has gifted me a truly special moment.",

The site is still under excavation, they'll find so so so much more under all the mounds and hills - how thrilling. They now charge a car parking fee of 30 tl plus the €11 entrance fee. Minus one star because of two reasons: 1. No audio guide was available and what limited written information was available on-site is poorly written from a tourists' point of view. It was clearly written by an academic who assumes you know the function of each building, it needs to be less technical and more descriptive. An audio guide would have been great here. 2. A lot more needs to be done to preserve the ruins - you have people climbing all over them and exposed mosaics that people can walk on and very little is being done to prevent it. Also, there are collapsed fences, signs and excavation equipment all over the place - it needs a tidy up. Otherwise it's just wonderful, give yourself nearly 3 hours to see everything.",
