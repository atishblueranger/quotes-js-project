            "text": "(Translated by Google) When you consider the number of people and the price, it was very affordable. We stayed in September 2024 for 2500 TL per night. The rooms were good. The furnishings were a bit old, unfortunately, the cleaning could be better because the pillowcases, sheets and covers were not changed, they did not smell clean, they smelled bad. There is only one air conditioner in one room and it is a bit noisy. Ms. Emine helps with everything.\nIf you do not have a car, places like Migros and the bazaar are 5 minutes away on foot, but a car is required for the beaches because there is no beach nearby.\n\n(Original)\nKişi sayısını ve ücreti düşündüğünüz de gayet uygundu Eylül 2024 de geceliği 2500 TL den kaldık, odalar iyiydi eşyalar biraz eski maalesef temizlik daha iyi olabilir çünkü yastık kılıfları çarşaflar ve örtüler değiştirilmemiş temiz kokmuyor du, kötü kokuyordu. Sadece bir oda da klima var biraz sesli çalışıyor. Emine hanım her konuda yardımcı oluyor.\nAracınız yoksa Migros ve çarşı gibi yerler yürüyerek 5 dakika ama plajlar için araba şart yakında plaj yok çünkü",
