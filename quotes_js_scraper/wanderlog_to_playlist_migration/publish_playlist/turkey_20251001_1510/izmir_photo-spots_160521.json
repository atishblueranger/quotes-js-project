            "text": "Alexander Calder's sculpture on İzmir's First Kordon is a striking addition to the city's waterfront, blending dynamic movement with monumental presence. True to Calder's signature style, the piece features a bold, abstract form with delicate, suspended elements that sway with the wind, creating a mesmerizing interplay of balance and motion. Its organic curves and sharp angles echo both natural and mechanical influences, standing as a testament to Calder's mastery of kinetic art. Positioned against the backdrop of the Aegean Sea, the sculpture transforms with the shifting light and breeze, making it not just a static monument but a living part of the landscape. This installation enriches İzmir's cultural fabric, offering both locals and visitors a contemplative and ever-changing visual experience.",

A lot of broken bottles and rubbish here 😢 I don't know why people litter at such an important place. We took Uber up here because it's not easy at all to walk up the hill, not to mention to get lost if you don't know Turkish. However, it's easy to walk along the stairs and the road following the Google map. You can see the walls in ruins and also the water storage in Byzantine period, similar to the one in the city of Izmir. I notice on the map a museum is right by the castle. But  it doesn't seem open or existing anyone. Overall, Kadifekale is very nice to visit and quite potential if this place can be maintained well and advised properly for tourists. 👍✅🎉",
