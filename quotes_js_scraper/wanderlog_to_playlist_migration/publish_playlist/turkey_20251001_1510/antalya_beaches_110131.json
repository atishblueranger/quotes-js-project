The aquarium is small for the price-yes, there are some nice fish, but definitely not enough to justify the cost. Not many sharks either, and the so-called “longest tunnel” wasn't anything special.\n\nWhat made the experience worse was the staff. They were not friendly at all, and made a fuss because we bought tickets online. It felt like they were trying to find ways to charge us more.\n\nAlso, charging kids from 3 years old is just ridiculous. For a place this size, that feels greedy more than anything else.\n\nUnless you get in at a heavily discounted price, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's clearly a ripoff.",

It wasn't overcrowded, a lovely restaurant, clean toilet, which a lovely lady cared for. We took a sun bed which also included two sun chairs and a table for two, 4 bottles of water and a fruit plate. It was a bit pricey (3000 TL) yes, something we wouldn't do every day, but we were here only for a few days. So two luxurious beach days were affordable. And it was worth it. It's a lovely place, clean and peaceful. Chill out music, but not too loud. I enjoyed it very much. There are also cheaper options. A two person sun bed for ( not sure, I guess it was 2000 TL ?) or sun chairs. The sun chairs were 400 TL for one. This place has everything that makes it a great stay.",

You can rent a beach bungalow for 400 lira for one day which gave us a bed, table, and a hangout area right on the beachfront which seemed like a good deal. They even gave us a discount of 50 lira for the second day we used the bungalow. There are other cheaper offers for other hangout places but the bungalow was at least isolated and comfortable if you're worried about covid and being around people.\n\nThe food is average but the milkshakes are quite delicious. My gf ordered 2 different salads on different days but she was served the same salad both times so there seem to be generic things offered based upon what you order. I would not recommend the offered seafood platter because even though on the menu the price is around 60+ lira the price ended up being 180 lira and was 40% fish head which doesn't seem worth it (or tasty). The other food was ok for the prices offered but nothing to write home about. The sea is nice but if it's too windy there can be trash in the water.\n\nI'd go back here if I come back to Turkey again.",

One down side is if you're not a great swimmer this is a fairly risky swimming spot rocky all around and quite shallow in spots so when the tide goes out I cut my foot off of the rocky seabed but just swim out past the rocks and you'll be fine. As for the price ? 400tl entrance fee but the drinks were averagely priced in comparison to other places although I'm not sure of the alcohol level in the drinks seemed light to me but I'm Irish that could be just my tolerance level 😁",
