The area around the clock tower is rich in historical sites, including the tombs of Osman Ghazi and Orhan Ghazi, the founding fathers of the Ottoman Empire.",

What makes it unique is the way it's prepared slowly over coal, the way one would barbecue.\n\nThe server brought the trays carrying the empty cups (each of a different color), as well as water and loukoum, a local tradition, which I find endearing.\n\nLater, when the coffee was ready, he brought each separately in a copper coffee pot, made differently to meet each of our tastes (sweet, black, half sugar).\n\nJust sitting there and observing the crowd around gives one a sense of serenity and calm, something we needed at the end of a very busy and tiring day.\n\nPeople sitting and chatting, others mulling around, the smell of coffee brewing hanging in the air, it's all a pleasure one has to experience.\n\nI would definitely recommend for everyone who gets the chance to enjoy 😊 this treat.",

This park has an abundance of flowers along every path that can make your life's stress disappear. There are lots of tulip blooms in the park, including red, yellow, and pink ones. That was incredibly fascinating!!\n\nThe park includes tea gardens, restaurants, the Bursa Archaeology Museum, the Conservatory Building, the Open Air Theatre, and an amusement park.\n\nThe name of the amusement park is Luna Park or Altin Park. Because of the Eid season, it was packed with kids and their families.\n\nThis theme park offers an enormous selection of rides. These include the Atli Carinca, Ferris Wheel, Crushing cars, Adrenalin Max, Gandola, Mini Train, Octopus Ride, Crazy Dancing, and many more",
