As soon as you step inside, you feel the cool, fresh air and see the incredible stalactites and stalagmites that have formed over thousands of years, it's truly amazing to look at.\nThe cave is not very big, but it's well worth seeing, especially if you're interested in nature and geology. The atmosphere inside is calm and quiet, and it's easy to walk around at your own pace and take it all in.\nIt's also really close to the beach, so it's easy to fit into your day if you're already in the area. The small entrance fee is worth it for such a unique experience. I'd recommend it to anyone visiting Alanya - a little hidden gem that's definitely worth a stop!",

The staff at the entrance were polite, helpful, and welcoming, which made the visit more pleasant.\n\nIt doesn't take too long to explore the cave, but it's a nice stop, especially if you are already visiting the nearby Cleopatra Beach. The atmosphere inside is cool and peaceful, making it a great way to escape the heat for a while.\n\nOverall, a simple but beautiful natural attraction with kind workers and fair prices.

The food is also very delicious and the menu has something for everyone.\n\nInfinity pool with a swim-up bar... stunning. It was very hard to leave. Temperature was perfect, pool was clean.
