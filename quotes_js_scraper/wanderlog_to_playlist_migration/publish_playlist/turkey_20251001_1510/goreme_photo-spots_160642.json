This tour generally costs 20 Euros for 2 hours and they cover three valleys - Love Valley, Rose/Red Valley, Sword Valley. I found this tour totally worth it. If you have more time in hand, you can go for a trekking along these valleys as well which can take 6-8 hours. All these valleys are pretty nice and beautiful. On top of that riding ATV through these valleys was a pretty unique and interesting experience. Red/Rose valley has unique formations with red color and hence the name as red valley.",

You can choose to climb up rocks and hills to achieve better views and make it more exciting but it's not essential.\n\nIt's amazing to see all the carvings and dwellings in the rocks, some of them are very high and makes you wonder how they managed to create these all them years ago! Most of of the dwellings are off limits but there are some you can get into and have a look around. Amazing to see some that have 2 stories and carved out stairs between the 2 floors, can only imagine how long it must have taken to make them..\n\nIt's a 2/3 hour hike hike so manage your time, we were luck to get it just right and catch the sunset right at the end which was beautiful! We travelled with 2 boys aged 8 and 10 and they enjoyed it very much.  There is also a small shop selling refreshments about half way through but I'd still suggest taking your own water, the shop just pops up when you think you are in the middle of nowhere!! (See Pics)\n\nWe enjoyed this hike, no need to do it again but would recommend if your in Cappadocia! We decided to go it on our own, no tour guide and was reasonably straight forward, there are a few valleys and if you plan to visit more then 1 I'd suggest a guide.",

In thia trail you have to navigate in really narrow and steep wodden and iron stairs in absolutely stunning narrow gorge that you see rarely anybody taking even when you are still in one of the most heavily touristy place in the world! The key to finding thia route is to take the right turn from the exit on the right of Goreme Open Air Museum, from the top of the road. There is a big instruction plate on the right of the asphalt rpad but the plate can hardly be read. We followed an All Trail app trail tp fins this entry to the route and not to get lost - it was absolutely unexpected what we found, a very adventourous journey well worth taking!",

Red Valley ATV in Cappadocia, Turkey, is more than just your typical off-road ride. It's a heart-pounding journey through a landscape sculpted by millions of years of nature's handiwork.\nRed Hot and Ready to Roll: The star of the show is, of course, the Red Valley itself. The volcanic soil here paints the landscape a fiery red, especially at sunset, creating a truly otherworldly backdrop for your ATV adventure. As you navigate the dusty trails, prepare to be awestruck by the towering fairy chimneys, hoodoos standing sentinel over the valley floor.\nThrills with a View: The tour itself is a perfect blend of excitement and sightseeing. You'll get behind the wheel of your own ATV (or share with a friend) and follow a guide on a pre-determined route. The pace keeps things interesting, with sections that allow you to open it up a bit and feel the rush of adrenaline, balanced with slower sections where you can soak in the scenery.\nBeyond the Red: The beauty of the Red Valley ATV tour is that it takes you beyond just the Red Valley itself. Depending on the tour you choose, you might also wind your way through other Cappadocia gems like the Rose Valley, with its blush-colored cliffs, or Love Valley, famous for its phallic-shaped rock formations (ahem, interesting photo opportunity!).\nGeared Up for Fun: Safety is a priority here. The tour operators provide helmets, goggles, and any other necessary gear to keep you protected. They'll also give you a quick safety briefing before setting off, ensuring everyone is comfortable and confident on their ATV.\nHere are some things to keep in mind:\nBe Adventure Ready: This is an off-road adventure, so expect a bumpy ride and some dust. Dress accordingly in comfortable clothes and closed-toe shoes.\nExperience Matters: While no prior ATV experience is necessary, some tours might be better suited for more experienced riders. Check with the operator beforehand.\nCapture the Moment: Don't forget your camera! The scenery is begging to be photographed, and you'll definitely want to capture memories of your thrilling ride.\n\nOverall, Red Valley ATV is a fantastic way to experience the unique wonders of Cappadocia. It's perfect for adventure seekers, nature lovers, and anyone who wants to add a dose of excitement to their Cappadocia itinerary.",

However, there are a little more than 4 km from Göreme so it takes 45 minutes to get there (have a flashlight to be visible when walking in the morning because you walk on tracks that are sometimes used by vehicles carrying hot air balloons).",

On top of that riding ATV through these valleys was a pretty unique and interesting experience. Sword valley has unique formations which resembles like a sword and hence the name as sword valley.",

The picture spaces were absolutely gorgeous and yes there is a small charge to take pictures here but absolutely worth it for the experience.

When we mentioned our plan, he was very accommodating and pointed us to the second level of the store, where the setup is located.\n\nThe space costs €20 for 30 minutes, which is quite affordable compared to similar places, based on other reviews I've read. They also offer a professional photographer with drone services for €100, but we brought our own tripod and remote clicker, so we did everything ourselves.\n\nThe great part is that you get the entire space to yourself, which is comforting when you're paying for a private session. Usually, they require bookings in advance, but since the space was free when we arrived, we were able to start right away. If you have a specific time in mind, it's best to visit in advance and reserve.\n\nThe setup upstairs is absolutely divine-beautiful carpets, bench, pillows and vibrant lamps create a magical atmosphere. We weren't rushed at all and were able to finish our shoot comfortably.\n\nAfterwards, we had a pleasant chat with the owner about the carpets on display. He has such a positive vibe, which was a lovely touch. We also learned that they organize international shipping if you decide to purchase larger carpets, which is great to know if you're traveling.\n\nHighly recommended!",
