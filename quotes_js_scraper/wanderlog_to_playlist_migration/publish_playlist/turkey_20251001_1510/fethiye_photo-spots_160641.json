Usually clean. Mountain view in the background and islands around were a bonus. Nice for sunsets. Many locals go there with chairs and tables and eat and drink.\n\nSome parts of the beach were quiet, mostly on week days, but it got too busy on weekends and in the afternoona in general. As an introvert, I would not enjoy the Calis beach in summer when it gets overcrowded. In winter it was still fine for me on weekdays.\n\nWhat I did not enjoy: way too many people smoking on the beach, they do not care at all if there's any non-smokers around (for a lifelong non-smoker, it was disgusting to me). And also many locals were fishing there, jus anywhere among other people who went there for a swim (yes, I did go for a swim even in winter when the water was not very warm but that's why I was staying next to the beach) and it was bothering having to check the fishing sticks and lines all around me. It's very inconsiderate that the fishermen do not stick to the end of the beach in order not to disturb other people who are not on the beach for fishing.",

            "text": "As someone who has spent her entire life in Fethiye-from birth through childhood and high school-I'd like to share a few thoughts about Çalış Beach (Çalış Plajı).\n\nLet me say this upfront: the water at Çalış isn't the cleanest or most pristine you'll find. That's a fact anyone can figure out, whether they're visiting for the first time or have lived here for years. But the real charm of Çalış isn't in its water quality-it's in the experience.\n\nÇalış is one of those rare beaches where you can walk barefoot on soft sand, where the shore doesn't feel like it's fenced off or commercialized with a cordon or barrier. You're not forced to pay high entrance fees, buy overpriced drinks, or reserve a sunbed just to enjoy the sea. There's a quiet kind of justice in that. You can just be.\n\nThe view here is stunning, especially at sunset-one of the best in all of Fethiye. You can grab a cold beer from a nearby bakkal, walk down to the beach, and enjoy it with your loved ones without bothering anyone. It's that simple. That free. You can walk, breathe, watch the Knight Island across the bay, and feel like you're in a space that welcomes you as you are.\n\nThere are wonderful restaurants around too-especially fish restaurants-and the pubs feel just right for Fethiye. The atmosphere is unpretentious, friendly, and open. Çalış offers a kind of democratic beauty-natural and social-that makes the friendships and memories you form here feel extra special and lasting.\n\nThat said, I also want to offer a sincere warning. The water here may look calm and inviting, but it can get surprisingly deep after just a few steps. I say this as someone who nearly drowned here as a child, despite being a strong swimmer today. If you don't know how to swim, don't go in alone. It's deceptive. The sea bottom drops quickly, and before you know it, you're in over your head. There's also a fair amount of underwater moss, which might feel unpleasant or slippery.\n\nSo please-enjoy Çalış, but do so with care. Let yourself go with the flow, but not without a sense of awareness and respect for the sea.",
