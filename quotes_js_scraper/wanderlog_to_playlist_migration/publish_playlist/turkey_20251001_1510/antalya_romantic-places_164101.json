Entry prices vary for locals and foreigners, which might catch some off guard, but it's understandable and helps keep sites like this affordable for residents. The waterfall itself is stunning, with lush greenery and a peaceful atmosphere. One of the highlights is the cave that runs behind the waterfall. It's such a unique experience to walk through and see the water cascading from behind. However, if you're tall or have mobility issues, be cautious. The cave has some low ceilings and uneven steps that can be tricky. Still, it's an amazing natural site that's definitely worth checking out. Whether you're a local or a visitor, it's a relaxing and memorable way to spend an afternoon.",

The site is still under excavation, they'll find so so so much more under all the mounds and hills - how thrilling. They now charge a car parking fee of 30 tl plus the €11 entrance fee. Minus one star because of two reasons: 1. No audio guide was available and what limited written information was available on-site is poorly written from a tourists' point of view. It was clearly written by an academic who assumes you know the function of each building, it needs to be less technical and more descriptive. An audio guide would have been great here. 2. A lot more needs to be done to preserve the ruins - you have people climbing all over them and exposed mosaics that people can walk on and very little is being done to prevent it. Also, there are collapsed fences, signs and excavation equipment all over the place - it needs a tidy up. Otherwise it's just wonderful, give yourself nearly 3 hours to see everything.",

The aquarium is small for the price-yes, there are some nice fish, but definitely not enough to justify the cost. Not many sharks either, and the so-called “longest tunnel” wasn't anything special.\n\nWhat made the experience worse was the staff. They were not friendly at all, and made a fuss because we bought tickets online. It felt like they were trying to find ways to charge us more.\n\nAlso, charging kids from 3 years old is just ridiculous. For a place this size, that feels greedy more than anything else.\n\nUnless you get in at a heavily discounted price, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's clearly a ripoff.",

            "text": "Dining at 7 Mehmet was a truly unforgettable experience. From the moment we arrived, we were captivated by the incredible sea views-whether you're seated inside, upstairs, on the open or covered terrace, the scenery is absolutely stunning. The ambiance is elegant yet relaxed, spread across two stories with thoughtfully designed spaces that enhance the overall experience.\n\nThe service was top-notch: attentive, efficient, and warm without being overbearing. They even offered blankets once the evening breeze picked up-a small but thoughtful touch that really stood out. The bathrooms were spotless, reflecting the same care and attention shown throughout the restaurant.\n\nNow, the food is absolutely phenomenal. This is authentic Turkish cuisine at its finest,  and I couldn't stop ordering. Every single dish was a hit: from the lofte, lamb, and chicken to the tenderloin, and that fava bean appetizer with fried onions-each plate was beautifully prepared and packed with flavor. And the desserts? A dream. The goat milk pistachio ice cream, baked rice pudding, and pumpkin dessert were the perfect finish.\n\nThey were also very accommodating of gluten-free allergies, which made the experience even more enjoyable and stress-free.\n\nYes, it's popular for a reason, so I'd highly recommend making a reservation. From ambiance and food to service and views, everything was flawless. I'm already looking forward to going back-this is a must-visit spot for anyone looking for a 5-star Turkish dining experience in Antalya.",

            "text": "Honestly, I am so disappointed in this place. I made a special reservation here as it was my last night in Turkey and had researched what I thought would be a fabulous dining experience with a spectacular view. Alas, I was woefully disappointed. While the restaurant itself boasts decent views, they are clouded by a perpetual cloud of smoke from everyone smoking and contaminating your food. Service was poor. The hostess had an attitude from the second we arrived and when we asked to be reseated, mere moments after first sitting, because the smoke was so intoxicating it was causing me to cough, she increased her attitude ten fold. It took us over 15 minutes to finally be served - and while the server did bring us our food, he never checked on us or asked us if we needed anything else. I wish I could say the food was good, but it was mediocre at best with nothing being seasoned. My salad still had massive, bitter stalks on the greens making it too tough and bitter to eat.\n\nIf you're looking for a nice view, you could perhaps consider this location for a sunset drink but I would highly discourage dinner or spending any meaningful amount of time here.",

Service charge comes automatically.\n\nProbably last time and no recommendation until I hear an improvement.",

Luckily, we found one. We ate at the restaurant a few times during our six-day stay in Antalya, and it was absolutely fantastic every time. The food, the hygiene, the staff – it was all spot on. The boss is great. After we first visited, he offered us a big free salad each time, and Turkish tea, of course! Yes, Please! ! My kids are big fans of yours – you guys are doing a great job!  If you're a first-time tourist, I'd recommend going straight to the Old Town Restaurant for your first meal.
