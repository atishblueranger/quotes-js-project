Named after the Turkish Sufi and poet Hacı Bayram-ı Veli, it offers a fascinating blend of spiritual and historical value.\n\nThe surrounding area is equally captivating. Behind the mosque, you'll find a park with ancient signs of the past, including monuments from the Roman era, over 2100 years old. The traditional handcraft shops nearby add to the cultural richness of the experience.\n\nIn addition to its beauty and history, Hacı Bayram Mosque offers excellent views of Ankara city. The ♿accessibility is well thought out, with a dedicated 🅿️parking lot and a lift making it easy for everyone to reach the mosque.\nA must-visit if you're in Ankara!",

The mosque was constructed shortly after his death and became a center for spiritual learning and devotion. Over the centuries, the mosque has undergone several renovations, blending Seljuk and Ottoman architectural styles, which gives it a unique charm.\n\nArchitecture and Features\n\nThe Hacı Bayram Mosque has a simple yet elegant design. Its brick and stone structure, along with its wooden roof, reflects the architectural style of its era. Inside, the mosque is adorned with beautiful calligraphy and wooden decorations. Despite its modest size, it exudes a deep sense of serenity, enhanced by the spiritual significance of the place.\n\nSpiritual and Cultural Importance\n\nAs a spiritual hub, the mosque continues to attract both worshippers and visitors from around the country and beyond. It is particularly busy during religious holidays and special events, and many people visit the tomb of Hacı Bayram Veli, located adjacent to the mosque, to pay their respects.\n\nThe proximity to the Temple of Augustus also highlights Ankara's cultural layers, with ancient Roman history sitting alongside Ottoman and Islamic heritage.\n\nVisitor Experience\n\nVisiting the Hacı Bayram Mosque offers a peaceful and reflective experience. The surrounding area has been recently developed into a lively plaza with shops and cafes, making it an enjoyable stop for both spiritual and cultural exploration.\n\nOverall, the Hacı Bayram Mosque is a must-visit for anyone interested in Ankara's historical and religious landscape.",

The whole place has this calm, airy atmosphere that makes it perfect for studying, reading, or just escaping the noise of the city.\n\nThe coffee? 9/10. The staff? Friendly and professional.

Standing tall in the Çankaya district, this observation and communications tower is not just a tourist attraction-it's a symbol of the city itself.\n\nThe tower features a panoramic terrace with 360-degree views of Ankara, making it a perfect spot for photography lovers and anyone who wants to see the capital from above. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is truly stunning.\n\nInside Atakule, you'll find a variety of restaurants, cafés, and shops. The revolving restaurant is a special highlight-it slowly rotates while you dine, allowing you to enjoy a changing view of the city as you eat. There's also a modern shopping area at the base of the tower, with local and international brands, making it a great place to spend a few hours.\n\nThe area around Atakule is peaceful and well-maintained, perfect for a walk or a coffee break. It's also easy to access by taxi or public transportation.\n\nOverall, Atakule is more than just a tower-it's an experience. Whether you're a local or a visitor, I highly recommend adding it to your Ankara itinerary.🌺🌺🌺♥️♥️♥️🤩",

There is an immense hoard of treasures here, from the eight thousand year old matriarch that sits at the head of the collection to the sun disk symbol of Ankara (from 2,500 BCE) to a ninth century BCE bronze cauldron to exquisite tiny icons to Roman gold and a bronze of Apollo, let alone the mesopotamian friezes and lions and reliefs. Awesome. I see why they feel they can charge £10 - the collection, and many single items, are of world historic importance and ooze quality in their craftsmanship from the earliest days of civilization to the high Roman.",
