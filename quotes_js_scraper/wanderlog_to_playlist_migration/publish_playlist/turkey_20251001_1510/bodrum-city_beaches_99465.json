A wonderfully secluded spot, the windmills themselves may not be much to look at but the view from up on the hillside is breathtaking and is well worth the climb.",

These windmills date back to the 18th century, when they were primarily used for grinding grain, especially wheat and barley. The region's strong and consistent winds made it an ideal location for windmills to harness wind energy for milling.\nThese are made of local stones. Over time, most of these windmills stopped functioning as mechanized milling methods took over. These are often photographed by tourists, especially at sunset.",
