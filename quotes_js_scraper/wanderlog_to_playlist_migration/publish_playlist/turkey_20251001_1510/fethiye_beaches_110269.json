The staff was quick and attentive throughout the day.\n\nIn the evening, we moved to their other section for an event-which, I have to say, had an even better atmosphere. The ambiance and the crowd were truly top-notch. However, the service during the event really fell short. It took forever to get drinks, and the alcohol was significantly overpriced. The line was so long and the prices so steep that no one in our group could actually enjoy a proper drink, let alone get tipsy.\n\nOverall, it's a beautiful spot with a lot of potential, but the evening event experience could definitely be improved-especially the bar service.",

Usually clean. Mountain view in the background and islands around were a bonus. Nice for sunsets. Many locals go there with chairs and tables and eat and drink.\n\nSome parts of the beach were quiet, mostly on week days, but it got too busy on weekends and in the afternoona in general. As an introvert, I would not enjoy the Calis beach in summer when it gets overcrowded. In winter it was still fine for me on weekdays.\n\nWhat I did not enjoy: way too many people smoking on the beach, they do not care at all if there's any non-smokers around (for a lifelong non-smoker, it was disgusting to me). And also many locals were fishing there, jus anywhere among other people who went there for a swim (yes, I did go for a swim even in winter when the water was not very warm but that's why I was staying next to the beach) and it was bothering having to check the fishing sticks and lines all around me. It's very inconsiderate that the fishermen do not stick to the end of the beach in order not to disturb other people who are not on the beach for fishing.",

            "text": "As someone who has spent her entire life in Fethiye-from birth through childhood and high school-I'd like to share a few thoughts about Çalış Beach (Çalış Plajı).\n\nLet me say this upfront: the water at Çalış isn't the cleanest or most pristine you'll find. That's a fact anyone can figure out, whether they're visiting for the first time or have lived here for years. But the real charm of Çalış isn't in its water quality-it's in the experience.\n\nÇalış is one of those rare beaches where you can walk barefoot on soft sand, where the shore doesn't feel like it's fenced off or commercialized with a cordon or barrier. You're not forced to pay high entrance fees, buy overpriced drinks, or reserve a sunbed just to enjoy the sea. There's a quiet kind of justice in that. You can just be.\n\nThe view here is stunning, especially at sunset-one of the best in all of Fethiye. You can grab a cold beer from a nearby bakkal, walk down to the beach, and enjoy it with your loved ones without bothering anyone. It's that simple. That free. You can walk, breathe, watch the Knight Island across the bay, and feel like you're in a space that welcomes you as you are.\n\nThere are wonderful restaurants around too-especially fish restaurants-and the pubs feel just right for Fethiye. The atmosphere is unpretentious, friendly, and open. Çalış offers a kind of democratic beauty-natural and social-that makes the friendships and memories you form here feel extra special and lasting.\n\nThat said, I also want to offer a sincere warning. The water here may look calm and inviting, but it can get surprisingly deep after just a few steps. I say this as someone who nearly drowned here as a child, despite being a strong swimmer today. If you don't know how to swim, don't go in alone. It's deceptive. The sea bottom drops quickly, and before you know it, you're in over your head. There's also a fair amount of underwater moss, which might feel unpleasant or slippery.\n\nSo please-enjoy Çalış, but do so with care. Let yourself go with the flow, but not without a sense of awareness and respect for the sea.",

This is very expensive and they need to understand that making it expensive to enter makes me less likely to spend inside which is exactly what happened. They charge 20TL for children 12 and older. So heads up on that too.\n\nHygiene: They have decently clean bathrooms. We did not see any showers which was unfortunate. The seats were decent.\n\nFood: They have food and drinks. Beers are 20 TL. Dishes with meat are around 30 TL. Tea is 3.50 TL. The prices are high but not crazy high. They work with a card system. So you load money in the beginning and pay with that card. They said they return the unused money when you exit. We did not buy anything so I can't report back on any more than that.\n\nThe beach: Rocky beach with beautiful clear and warm water.\n\nOther options: if you have your own car there are similar places you can probably go to without having to pay per person. I would say most places will cost 25 TL to park your car and not take per person fees so this is quite a bit more than what most places cost.",

            "text": "Küçük Boncuklu Bay is a hidden slice of paradise tucked away along the Fethiye coastline - quiet, raw, and strikingly beautiful. Unlike the more crowded beaches nearby, this small cove offers a peaceful retreat into nature where the sea sparkles in deep shades of turquoise and green, framed by pine-covered hills.\n\nThe beach is made up of small pebbles, which keeps the water crystal clear and perfect for snorkeling or simply floating and watching the sunlight dance on the surface. There's a small, charming beach establishment that provides sunbeds, drinks, and a few simple but tasty food options, yet the overall feel remains untouched and authentic.\n\nWhat sets Küçük Boncuklu apart is its intimate atmosphere. It's not overly polished or touristy - instead, it offers the kind of calm that only comes from places that haven't been overrun. You can hear the cicadas, feel the breeze, and just… breathe.\n\nIt's ideal for couples, solo travelers, or anyone looking to escape into nature for a few hours. Just be sure to bring water shoes if you're not used to pebble beaches, and a good book if you plan to stay - because once you're here, you won't want to leave anytime soon.",

Nestled along a quiet peninsula near Fethiye, this cove is embraced by green hills and pine trees, offering shade and a lush backdrop to the shimmering Aegean waters. ￼ The beach isn't large-roughly 130 meters of golden sand mixing with pebbles-but its size only adds to the intimate and peaceful vibe. ￼\n\nThe water here is nothing short of magical-clear, calm, and inviting. At times, it resembles an aquarium, especially on windless mornings when the surface is glassy. ￼ I did notice some sharp rocks along certain entry points, so I'd highly recommend wearing water shoes for a more comfortable entry. ￼\n\nDespite being privately operated, the beach maintains an affordable and welcoming feel. There's a modest entrance fee-around 300 TRY per person during peak season-to access the beach, including amenities like sunbeds and umbrellas. ￼ It's worth every kuruş because the staff are exceptionally friendly and attentive, consistently ready to take your order or assist as needed. ￼\n\nConvenience is a priority here. A well-positioned parking area lies close to restrooms, showers, and changing cabins. ￼ ￼ Even when parking isn't free, it's well worth it for the comfort and peace of mind it offers. ￼\n\nFacilities go beyond the basics-there's a neat café-bar on site with a menu of snacks, sandwiches, pasta, and refreshing drinks, all reasonably priced. ￼ The place has a relaxed, upbeat vibe, with nice music in the background that enhances the ambience without ever being overpowering. ￼ ￼\n\nOne of the most special moments for me was spotting sea turtles gliding near the cliffs-unexpected, delightful, and soul-stirring. ￼\n\nTiming your visit can enrich the experience further. I chose to go in May, and the beach was peaceful-practically deserted at times, giving me a rare sense of personal paradise. ￼ In contrast, summer weekends can bring more locals and families, which is great if you enjoy a livelier scene-but if peace is what you're after, May, June, or early September are golden months.\n\nOf course, everything isn't perfect. The rocky entry points and occasional slippery wooden decking mean caution is advised. ￼ ￼ Also, there are small complaints about occasional maintenance needs, like slippery steps or algae on some platforms-but these are minor in context. ￼ ￼\n\nIn sum, Küçük Samanlık Plajı is a standout-serene, beautifully maintained, and just the right blend of service and natural charm. Whether you're looking to escape for a quiet swim, enjoy a peaceful sun lounger under the trees, or spot a sea turtle while sipping a cold drink, this beach delivers in spades. A hidden slice of coastal heaven near Fethiye that I wholeheartedly recommend.",

If take a scooter it might be even more fascinating to ride around the island after a beach session, both directions bring up completely different horizons. I recommend to do both, but if you are limited in time take the one starting to the right (East direction) from the beach.\nAt the beach there are very comfortable chaise longs, restrooms, parking & savage place too. But might be argued that it's a bit expensive though. #accessibility is preserved by flat solid surface near the beach & accessible restrooms.",
