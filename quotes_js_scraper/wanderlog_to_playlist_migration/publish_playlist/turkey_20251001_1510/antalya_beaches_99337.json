The aquarium is small for the price-yes, there are some nice fish, but definitely not enough to justify the cost. Not many sharks either, and the so-called “longest tunnel” wasn't anything special.\n\nWhat made the experience worse was the staff. They were not friendly at all, and made a fuss because we bought tickets online. It felt like they were trying to find ways to charge us more.\n\nAlso, charging kids from 3 years old is just ridiculous. For a place this size, that feels greedy more than anything else.\n\nUnless you get in at a heavily discounted price, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. It's clearly a ripoff.",
