Even the parking attendant was smoking. There are people everywhere, on the beaches, along the pathways,  in the undergrowth ratherthan use the available sunbeds. I can understand why they want to use it as the sea is quite choppy, but  if they do not look after it, it will not exist for much longer.

There is such an unprofessional simplicity that you don't realize that you are disturbing other people by shouting \"Hello my friend!\" out loud. Didn't we witness abusive speeches about the customers? As if the noise on the beach wasn't enough, we were exposed to the music the lady cooking was playing inside, with her swearings. We witnessed the staff shouting and using abusive language not only among themselves but also about the customers!..  It seemed like the staff came to have fun rather than to serve.

            "text": "I had the chance to visit Kumburnu Plajı, and I must say it was one of the most memorable beach experiences I've had in Turkey. I've traveled quite a bit and visited countless beaches, but there is something about this place that combines natural beauty, peaceful atmosphere, and thoughtful amenities in a way that makes it stand out. Let me share my experience in detail, because this gem deserves recognition.\n\nThe beach stretches out gracefully into a narrow strip of land that almost feels like it's hugging the turquoise waters on both sides. On one side you have the calm, crystal-clear lagoon of Ölüdeniz, and on the other side, the open sea with its deeper blue shades. It's like standing between two worlds, and the contrast is truly mesmerizing. No matter where you look, the colors of nature feel surreal-greens from the pine-covered mountains, shimmering blues from the water, and the golden tones of the sand.\n\nThe water here is something else. I've swum in many places, but the lagoon at Kumburnu is one of the calmest, cleanest, and most inviting I've ever experienced. It feels like a natural swimming pool, with gentle waves, shallow areas perfect for families with kids, and deeper spots for confident swimmers. The clarity is unbelievable-you can see small fish swimming around your feet. I even brought a snorkeling mask, and it felt like exploring an aquarium. If you are a nature lover, you will appreciate how unspoiled and well-preserved this beach is.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was renting a sunbed and umbrella. Yes, there is a small entrance fee, and you pay extra for the sunbeds, but I found it absolutely worth it. The facilities are clean, organized, and well-maintained. There are showers, restrooms, and changing cabins close to the beach, which makes the whole experience more comfortable. The staff were polite and attentive, always making sure visitors had what they needed. For me, that balance between natural beauty and practical service is what makes a place perfect.\n\nFood and drinks are also available on site. There's a beach café where you can grab a cold drink, an ice cream, or even have a proper meal if you want to spend the whole day there without leaving. Prices are fair considering the location and the view you are enjoying. I had a Turkish gözleme (stuffed flatbread) and a cold ayran, and it tasted even better while sitting under the shade with the lagoon right in front of me.\n\nWhat I appreciated most was the versatility of Kumburnu. If you want a quiet and relaxing day, you can find a peaceful spot under the trees and enjoy the sound of the waves. If you're with family, the lagoon is incredibly safe and fun for kids. And if you're adventurous, you're right next to the world-famous paragliding spot of Babadağ Mountain. Watching colorful parachutes glide gracefully over the lagoon while you're lying on your sunbed is a sight you'll never forget. It adds a touch of magic to the whole experience.\n\nOf course, like any popular destination, it can get crowded, especially in July and August. My advice is to come early in the morning or visit during May, June, or September if you prefer a calmer vibe. Even when it was busy, though, the beach never lost its charm. The natural beauty is simply too overwhelming to be overshadowed by crowds.\n\nAll in all, Kumburnu Plajı is a must-visit. It's more than just a beach-it's an experience that stays with you. The combination of calm lagoon waters, dramatic mountain views, and excellent facilities makes it one of the best beach spots in all of Turkey. Whether you're a solo traveler, a couple, or a family, you'll find something here that makes your visit unforgettable. I left with a sun-kissed smile, salt on my skin, and a deep sense of gratitude for discovering this slice of paradise.\n\nI highly recommend it to anyone visiting Fethiye or Ölüdeniz. Trust me, once you step onto the sand of Kumburnu and dip into its turquoise waters, you'll understand why so many people call it one of the most beautiful beaches in the world.",

            "text": "This place has only one thing going for it. The crystal clear water. Yes, the sea is stunning. The water is turquoise color. Beautiful. And that's it.\n\nThe negatives heavily outweigh this single positive thing. First of all, the crowd is crazy. There is insane amount of people here and sun-beds with umbrellas are so tightly packed you barely have any space to move around. On top of that, there is lots of people that bring their own towels and umbrellas and mix in between. As I said, the it's insanely crowded.\n\nEven the parking and the access road. If you are not there by 8am in the morning, be prepared to wait in a huge line of cars to enter the parking lot. We arrived around 10am, and waited around 25 minutes in the traffic in front of the parking lot.\n\nOkay, this is not a deal breaker, crowd on a beach is nothing new. But, considering the prices and how expensive it is, it's a horrible deal. Parking is 500 TL, around 10€. Sun-beds with an umbrella for 2 people cost 1200 TL, or ~25€. And if you want to order anything from the restaurant, again, very expensive. And for what? For a low end and uncomfortable sun-beds, small umbrella, mediocre service and such a tight packing of people that you feel like a sardine in a can. Simply horrible experience.\n\nAll of this, while you have multiple beaches just 5-10min drive away from the city centre, that are more than half a price and more than double the enjoyment (same crystal clear turquoise sea, beautiful sandy beach, cheap parking, cheap sun-beds, cheaper restaurants, spaciousness and no crowd anywhere).",

This is very expensive and they need to understand that making it expensive to enter makes me less likely to spend inside which is exactly what happened. They charge 20TL for children 12 and older. So heads up on that too.\n\nHygiene: They have decently clean bathrooms. We did not see any showers which was unfortunate. The seats were decent.\n\nFood: They have food and drinks. Beers are 20 TL. Dishes with meat are around 30 TL. Tea is 3.50 TL. The prices are high but not crazy high. They work with a card system. So you load money in the beginning and pay with that card. They said they return the unused money when you exit. We did not buy anything so I can't report back on any more than that.\n\nThe beach: Rocky beach with beautiful clear and warm water.\n\nOther options: if you have your own car there are similar places you can probably go to without having to pay per person. I would say most places will cost 25 TL to park your car and not take per person fees so this is quite a bit more than what most places cost.",

If take a scooter it might be even more fascinating to ride around the island after a beach session, both directions bring up completely different horizons. I recommend to do both, but if you are limited in time take the one starting to the right (East direction) from the beach.\nAt the beach there are very comfortable chaise longs, restrooms, parking & savage place too. But might be argued that it's a bit expensive though. #accessibility is preserved by flat solid surface near the beach & accessible restrooms.",

Nestled along a quiet peninsula near Fethiye, this cove is embraced by green hills and pine trees, offering shade and a lush backdrop to the shimmering Aegean waters. ￼ The beach isn't large-roughly 130 meters of golden sand mixing with pebbles-but its size only adds to the intimate and peaceful vibe. ￼\n\nThe water here is nothing short of magical-clear, calm, and inviting. At times, it resembles an aquarium, especially on windless mornings when the surface is glassy. ￼ I did notice some sharp rocks along certain entry points, so I'd highly recommend wearing water shoes for a more comfortable entry. ￼\n\nDespite being privately operated, the beach maintains an affordable and welcoming feel. There's a modest entrance fee-around 300 TRY per person during peak season-to access the beach, including amenities like sunbeds and umbrellas. ￼ It's worth every kuruş because the staff are exceptionally friendly and attentive, consistently ready to take your order or assist as needed. ￼\n\nConvenience is a priority here. A well-positioned parking area lies close to restrooms, showers, and changing cabins. ￼ ￼ Even when parking isn't free, it's well worth it for the comfort and peace of mind it offers. ￼\n\nFacilities go beyond the basics-there's a neat café-bar on site with a menu of snacks, sandwiches, pasta, and refreshing drinks, all reasonably priced. ￼ The place has a relaxed, upbeat vibe, with nice music in the background that enhances the ambience without ever being overpowering. ￼ ￼\n\nOne of the most special moments for me was spotting sea turtles gliding near the cliffs-unexpected, delightful, and soul-stirring. ￼\n\nTiming your visit can enrich the experience further. I chose to go in May, and the beach was peaceful-practically deserted at times, giving me a rare sense of personal paradise. ￼ In contrast, summer weekends can bring more locals and families, which is great if you enjoy a livelier scene-but if peace is what you're after, May, June, or early September are golden months.\n\nOf course, everything isn't perfect. The rocky entry points and occasional slippery wooden decking mean caution is advised. ￼ ￼ Also, there are small complaints about occasional maintenance needs, like slippery steps or algae on some platforms-but these are minor in context. ￼ ￼\n\nIn sum, Küçük Samanlık Plajı is a standout-serene, beautifully maintained, and just the right blend of service and natural charm. Whether you're looking to escape for a quiet swim, enjoy a peaceful sun lounger under the trees, or spot a sea turtle while sipping a cold drink, this beach delivers in spades.
