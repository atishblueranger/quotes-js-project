The promenade stretches along the Aegean coast with an easy, calming rhythm-waves gently brushing the shore, seagulls overhead, and a warm breeze carrying the scent of the sea.\n\nThe beach is clean and well-kept, and the walking path is lined with cafes, restaurants, and small shops. Whether you're after a peaceful morning stroll or a sunset walk with golden light reflecting on the water, Kadınlar Plajı offers a beautiful setting. The vibe is friendly and relaxed-locals and tourists alike enjoying the same stretch of coast, often stopping to take photos or grab an ice cream.\n\nIt's not just a beach-it's a social spot, a scenic route, and a peaceful escape all in one. I especially recommend going in the early evening when the sun begins to set behind the hills; the light, the colors, and the atmosphere are truly unforgettable.",

We easily found free parking nearby.\n\nInitially, we were scammed by a local who insisted we pay 500 TL for sun loungers and umbrellas, claiming we weren't staying at a nearby resort. Later, an official intervened, revealing the loungers were actually free and that we had been duped. We managed to recover our money, but the situation escalated into a heated argument between the official and a seemingly involved individual.\n\nFeeling sorry for the young man who helped us set up the loungers, I gave him a 100 TL tip.

We didn't order any food, so I can't say anything about that.\n\nThere's a 500 TL entrance fee, which I think is fair, especially since it wasn't crowded - a big advantage in my opinion. The water is very clean. You enter the sea directly from the deck, there's no gradual beach entry. There are some sea plants at the bottom, but that didn't bother us personally.\n\nAll in all, a pleasant experience - I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a more peaceful beach spot in Kuşadası.",

We used the adjacent hotel beach to access the sea via sand. Sandal Beach is still a good place to visit.\n\nOriginal review: June 2023\nNice place to get away from the crowds nearby. It has a shared beach with a hotel which has fresh cold sea water. A little understaffed so the service can be slow, but staff were polite and helpful. Food prices were average for the area - the frozen juices were very good. Sadly only one changing room and toilet was available. Sun loungers were good and situated on decking with a good sea view. The music got louder as the day went on. Overall a good experience with no issues.",

When you view from a distance it is stunning but when you get down to the beach near the Jade Beach Club, the beach is full of cigarette nubs and rubbish. You can find nice spots to sunbathe but the Jade Beach Club is not worth going to.\nThe peninsula part itself has been taken over by filthy homeless tramps. They are hostile and have out signs up saying private property. It is not private property. I would have walked past them and just went where I wanted but the sun was just setting and I didn't fancy being surrounded by crazy drunk bums at dark.\n\nThe police nice to move them along and stop them destroying the natural beauty. The area needs some investment, development and cleaning",

Apparently the city is ok with someone squatting on the land (property lines seem to be very much up for grabs and unenforced in this area). There are hand painted signs that say “Private Property. No access allowed. There are dogs.” Very childish looking. The only dog we saw walked by us very friendly. There are some tents. It's obvious that some homeless person is just trying to claim the land. Reading the other reviews, it seems like this is an old man and his three dogs trying to do something illegal - claim land that isn't his. This is within 30 minute walking distance of the cruise port, so it's quite surprising that the city authorities allow this behavior.",

The bar itself is excellent, with delicious food and drinks. The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive - we were truly impressed! The entrance fee was 400 TL, which is quite reasonable for everything you get there. Highly recommend!",
