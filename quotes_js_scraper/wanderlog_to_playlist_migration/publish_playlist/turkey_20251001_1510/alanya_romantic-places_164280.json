            "text": "Standing at the Red Tower in Alanya, gazing out over the deep blue sea, I felt as if I had stepped back in time to the Middle Ages. The gentle sound of waves crashing against the shore and the serene view under the clear sky created a sense of timeless tranquility. The tower's red bricks and its ancient, steadfast presence pulled me into a different era, leaving me with a blend of emotions that were both nostalgic and reflective.\n\nAs I looked at the medieval fortress, I couldn't help but wonder about the people who once stood in the same spot, taking in the very same sea. What did this view mean to them? Did they dream of the unknown world beyond the horizon, or was it merely a backdrop to their daily lives? While the sea represented freedom and calmness to me, for them, it might have been a stage for survival, a gateway to trade, or a boundary against threats.\n\nThe pleasant weather made my walk even more enjoyable. With the warm sunlight on my skin and a gentle sea breeze brushing past, I wandered along the path, savoring the blend of past and present. Amidst the modern buildings, the Red Tower stood as a portal to history, allowing me to momentarily step into the shoes of those who lived centuries before. For a brief moment, I felt less like a tourist and more like a character in a living story, where history whispered through the stones.\n\nUltimately, what I felt at the Red Tower was a profound sense of connection. It was a link between past and present, between myself and countless souls who had also gazed at this sea. Perhaps they, too, had felt the same breeze, stood against the same horizon, and pondered their place in the world. My experience at the Red Tower was more than just a travel memory-it was a resonant moment that left a lasting imprint on my story, blending the ancient with the present in a way that felt both humbling and inspiring.",

            "text": "Alanya is a coastal holiday resort on the Turkish Mediterranean coast, east of the city of Antalya. Jutting out from the harbour is a rocky peninsula and the castle sits over 800 feet high at the top. Although most of the building dates back to the 13th century its origins go back to Roman times. The surrounding walls are over 4 miles around and there are many ruins around the Castle and Citadel. Since 2009 it has been a World Heritage Site.\n\nFrom the harbour the road rises sharply. The Castle is well signed and the roads easy to follow. It's about a two mile climb and is very steep in places. However, if your lungs or legs are not up to it there are lots of taxis, a shuttle bus and even a cable car. Every hairpin bends brings new views with sections of the walls crossing over. Just before the summit there is a Viewpoint that gives an amazing view out over the bay and town. Don't miss that one.\n\nAt the top there are narrow streets weaving between the mosque, the old bazaar and the citadel. There are also many authentic tiny restaurants too.\nThe Castle is now a museum and has an entrance charge of €12.\n\nNo particular special kit needed for this, other than comfortable shoes.\nIt is important, however, to remember this is a hot climate, a 'modest' 22° for my visit in April. It can reach much hotter so the order of the day is lots of sun cream and lots and of water.",

The atmosphere inside is calm and quiet, and it's easy to walk around at your own pace and take it all in.\nIt's also really close to the beach, so it's easy to fit into your day if you're already in the area.

It's actually really smooth and there's fresh air coming in through the windows. The walk up all the steps to the castle is also very nice but the heat of the sun and the incline means you are putting in an extra 30% effort. All the staff were very friendly and the roof top restaurant or bar was not as expensive as you would think",

If you are with a stroller or wheelchair bound, I wouldn't recommend. I'm giving it a 4 star as the website is misleading and only states the price for turkish nationals, this is such basic information I can only assume this is intentional misdirection.
