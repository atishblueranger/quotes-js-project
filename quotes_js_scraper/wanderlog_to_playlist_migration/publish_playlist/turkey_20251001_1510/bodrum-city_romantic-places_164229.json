We chose to explore on our own and found it to be a fantastic experience ( we really enjoy castles already and have seen many) but this one was fairly well preserved with many labels. It also includes a museum of a couple shipwrecks that have been partially re constructed which were truly fascinating.  ( Ill say no to buying tickets in advance because it was simple to do with a Visa or Mastercard at the entrance otherwise you must use Turkish Lira currency)",

Compliments to the chef who makes the most amazing food - she made a birthday cake for us that was one of the best cakes we've ever had, catering to our wishes. They looked after us so well and the setting itself is tranquil and beautiful. We will be back (to try all of the food next time too!)! A must visit for anyone traveling to Bodrum.",

For my main course, I had  a piece of meat which was melt in your mouth tender and served with a side of truffled mashed potatoes and asparagus, and I finish my lovely dinner with the locals sweet it's was very delicious.\nOverall, I had a wonderful dining experience at  Kafedaki.

I went straight from the check-in to customs and passport control. There I had to wait for customs to open, which took approximately 40 minutes. There was shade but few places to sit. There was no delay in departure. Customs at Kos was quick. I got to the port 1 hour before on the way back. I spent 15 minutes in line for passport control. Fortunately, there was shade available. Then I found myself in a small area with benches, all of which were occupied, where all the passengers had to wait for the ferries to arrive. The entire process took me 40 minutes or a bit more. Once my ferry arrived and disembarked the passengers, I got in, took a seat, and we departed 10 minutes later. Passport control at Bodrum was quick.",

And immediately the managers face changed as if he was pissed off.\n\nWe were then offered a package for 2 which worked out around 60€.\nWhen we agreed he went back to his smiley friendly persona which just added to my anxiety.\n\nYou also felt you were obliged to take it as it seemed too good to decline.\nSo we agreed however, as we were offered a free Turkish bath. I didn't bring enough funds as I didn't feel I needed to carry much cash.\n\nThe venue itself doesn't have a separate changing room for men and women. Everything is shared.\nThere wasn't anything discussion if we would wanted a female therapist or not so all the services we received were by men.\n\nWe were told to go into the sauna and steam room with a man just standing outside and every time I came out he would just come over to me but provided no direction or instructions.\nIt just felt strange.\n\nAs waited for our massage we had to go upstairs and wait on the terrace which was very strange. It would have been nice for them to have a better set up to ensure comfortable as opposed to just sitting in a towel on a mat.\n\nThe massage therapists were women however there's no sight of them around unless you book a massage.\nJust a strange vibe. Not what you expect when you go to a place like this and intend to have a relaxing experience.\n\nI spoke with our holiday rep about this and shared my concerns.",
