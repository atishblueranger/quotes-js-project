Rather than clamber over the seats and rows of the theatre in those circumstances, I opted to take photos from across the dual carriage roadway. Lots of traffic as it was the weekend, so my photos include cars. Nevertheless seeing the amphitheater was worth the short climb on an extremely hot day. The views of Bodrum from there are spectacular. I highly recommend making the short trek.",

It also includes a museum of a couple shipwrecks that have been partially re constructed which were truly fascinating.

This is part of the 4th-century BCE fortifications built under King Mausolus; it was here, in 334 BCE, that fighting took place with Alexander the Great's forces-chronicles note that many defenders drowned in the ditches by the gate. Today the fragments of the towers with “stepped” corners and the roadway remain; the site is tidy, the path is easy, and there are brief info panels. Plan for 15–30 minutes: stroll, study the masonry, and take a panoramic photo. Best to come toward evening-soft light makes the stone read beautifully. Practical notes: wear shoes with good tread (the rock is slick); parking nearby is limited but manageable. Combined with the Mausoleum and St. Peter's Castle, it makes a well-rounded walk through the city's ancient history.\nAleks recommends 👍❗️",

Of course, there will be more visitors on this beach than on other sandy places, as there are more locals than tourists, but if you need to take some amateur Instagram photos*, this location is ideal.",

The other option is to find cafes where you promise to buy drinks and food during your stay.\n\nUnfortunately, the beach is stony but manageable. You forget about all extra money you pay, inconvenient ground under your feet when you see and swim in beautiful waters of the sea 🌊\nHowever, at 10am the sea throws out trash from tourists going on boat trips (cans, cigarettes, etc).",

The beach is very rocky, and there are lots of sea urchins and sharp stones in the water, so getting in can be tricky without water shoes. There are also many boats and yachts anchored close to the shore, which takes away from the natural feel and limits swimming space. The beach is quite dirty with lots of cigarette buts. Overall, it's an okay place to enjoy the view or grab a drink nearby, but not ideal for a beach day.",
