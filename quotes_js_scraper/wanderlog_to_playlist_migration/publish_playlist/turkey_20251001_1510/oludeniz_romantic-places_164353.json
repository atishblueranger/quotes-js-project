When we returned on the second night, we wanted to call the front desk for a bottle of water and some towels. However, we were told that housekeeping had already finished for the day and no services could be provided. They even suggested we go to the bar and pay for water if we were thirsty. Finding this unacceptable, I called the front desk again, only to have my calls hung up on twice. The attitude of the front desk staff was incredibly arrogant.\n\nWe ended up going to the front desk in person to speak with the staff and their manager. Although the towels and water were eventually delivered, there was no apology whatsoever. This is basic hotel service, but the front desk's deceitful behavior and the manager's dismissive attitude are completely intolerable!

            "text": "Ölüdeniz blu luxury was comfortable and clean. We were sick majority of our stay so tried out most of the room service menu, most food was good but the calamari and the kebab was terrible and dry. The Turkish ravioli, chicken schnitzel, sweet and sour chicken and fruit platter were our favourites.\nThe rooms stayed sound proof but we could hear all the people nearby in other rooms, which we didn't mind but could be a deal breaker for some.\nThe daily buffet was one of the best I've had, with slight variances each day and omelettes made to order we loved getting up each morning to visit the buffet breakfast.\nThe pool was so nice, but a bit cold and they had good music playing to set the tone.\nThe staff were very accomodating and helped with everything whether it be organising a taxi, getting a doctor or booking tours etc, which we later had to cancel. The hotel was also within walking distance to the beach, but they offer free push bikes which is good. Just beware the hill back up is slightly difficult without gears on the bike.\nOverall we recommend Blu Luxury Ölüdeniz!!",

In the centre are many fishmongers selling their wares for you to take home, or to buy and then have one of the surrounding restaurants cook it for you. The restaurants are all in the same market area. It gets very busy in the evenings, when you may find Turkish musicians playing at tables. The fish is very good value and very fresh every day. It's an enjoyable and interesting experience.",

There is a strong fishy smell everywhere (it is a fish market, so it's not surprising) which isn't the greatest while eating. It's also quite pricey especially considering the quality was ok at best.

            "text": "Oyster Residences is a Brilliant Hotel… but not for those who like to sleep at night…\n\n4 star hotel right on the beachside of the tourist town, Ölüdeniz. If you're looking for a paradise setting that'll give your Instagram a serious glow-up, this is the spot for you. The atmosphere in the hotel is very reminiscent of the atmosphere of Hayao Miyazaki's worlds. In this hotel, you can practically roll out of bed and go straight into the sea. But… that's if you actually get any sleep.\n\nThat's the main issue here, the noise. Ölüdeniz, being a tourist hotspot, means there are a lot of nightclubs nearby, and they seem to compete on who can blast their music the loudest at night. The booming bass doesn't stop until around roughly 2:30 AM, so if you're hoping for a peaceful night, think again.  If you enjoy late-night raves or have a deep appreciation for high-decibel beats, you'll fit right in. For the rest of us? Not so much.\n\nMy stay included breakfast, breakfast as many of you know opens very early and closes pretty early as well in many hotels. So after a night of listening to nightclub music, you wake up and basically drag yourself half-dead half-alive to this breakfast, since you paid for it. Speaking of breakfast, it's a mix of self-service and waiter-ordered options. You can get fresh fruit, pancakes, and juice yourself. As well as, order your desired breakfast. They don't have a menu, so you will have to figure it out yourself what exactly you want for breakfast.\n\nThe rooms are cozy, with a charming wooden design that fits the \"dream holiday\" vibe perfectly. However, if you get an attic room like I did, be prepared to whack your head on the oddly angled ceiling good few times. Room do have an air conditioning which you can turn on and off, but air conditioning is aimed directly at the bed, which can lead to a stiff neck or even catching a cold if you're not careful.\n\nAnother thing to mention, all guest rooms are located in different buildings and require stairs to reach your desired room. So if you are traveling with person who uses wheelchair, or elderly person or any person who has injuries, this hotel will not be a good option for you. Even first floor rooms will require you to climb a few steps.\n\nOn the bright side, this hotel features a stunning outdoor pool surrounded by olive trees. It's easily my personal highlight of the stay in this hotel.\n\nAnother thing I want to note, is the parking... The hotel does offer parking on its promises, but it's sooooo tiny, and cars are crammed in like sardines in the can. So you are required to give the keys to the receptionist when staying in the hotel, so they can shuffle cars around. So If you're a little paranoid about your car or your stuff inside, you might want to think twice. I'm just saying, the cars parked a few cm to each other.\n\nOverall, Oyster Residences is a beautiful hotel for a dream summer holiday, perfect for beach lovers and Instagrammers. Just be ready for a few sleepless nights and minor annoyances along the way.",

            "text": "We stayed here for six nights in the third week of August and had a lovely experience overall. The hotel has a perfect location, right in front of the beach. Our room was very clean and sufficient, just with a slight damp smell, but nothing major. Upon arrival, we were kindly upgraded from a standard room to one with a terrace facing the pool, which was a very nice gesture.\n\nBreakfast was tasty and sufficient, and the staff were always friendly and helpful, making us feel very comfortable. The atmosphere of the hotel is cozy and charming, and the beach is clean and beautiful. In the evenings, of course, you can hear music from outside, but it didn't bother us at all. After spending the day exploring and swimming, we slept very well at night.\n\nThe only downside is the overall busyness of the area. Parking the car or waiting for it to be taken out sometimes took time, but this is not the hotel's fault-it's just how crowded Ölüdeniz is in general.\n\nIf you're planning to spend most of your time outside and on the beach rather than in the room, this is a very sweet, convenient boutique hotel. We really enjoyed our stay and are grateful for the kind service. 🌿",

The music is very chilled (think 90's ibiza chill out music) which is perfect background acoustics. you may need a car, or at least to get the bus and then walk. Plenty of parking and well the views. Its just so good. Closes at 5pm and the beach is so much cleaner than other places. I hope it keeps the standards up, been going about ten years so far and its still good to be fair which is impressive in itself, keep up the excellent standards 'suncity' top marks",

And even if not the case, kids constantly screaming in the water will disturb the relax time you were hoping to get in the adult only zone…too bad as the site is fantastic and the lounge music well chosen.",
