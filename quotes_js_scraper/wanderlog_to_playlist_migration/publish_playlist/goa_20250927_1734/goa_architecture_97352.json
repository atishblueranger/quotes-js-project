The food is very delicious, fresh pao is served with every gravy and the masala's are yummy. I've not been here in a long time but have recommended this place to all my friends who visit Goa and they love it. A definite must visit if you're on a trip to Goa",

Built in 1619 (though a chapel existed on the site since 1541), it's a stunning example of Portuguese Baroque architecture with a blend of Goan style. The church features a distinctive double zigzag staircase, added in the late 19th century, and houses the second-largest bell in Goa, salvaged from the ruins of the Church of Our Lady of Grace in Old Goa. Daily masses are held in English, Konkani, and Portuguese. The interior, while not overly extravagant, is colorful and features intricately carved altars. The church is beautifully illuminated at night and is a popular destination for both locals and tourists, especially during the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8th. The church is easily accessible and offers panoramic views of Panaji. I visited on 4th August 2025",

I saw plenty of cracks in the plaster everywhere (guesthouse and main building). The garden was being decently maintained by the nepali staff. The swimming pool was always unoccupied. Norbert's fitness studio was in the same building as the guesthouses. I loved the quietude of this gated complex. During the day, the sun beats down and bakes the place. At night, it is cool and calm. I loved the incredible views of the Zuari river, Vasco city, Mandovi river from the 7th floor although it is terribly foggy this time of year. I didn't quite like the plethora of stray indie dogs roaming all over the complex barking randomly at strangers. Would love to visit this beautiful locale again soon.",

The food was absolutely delicious - the peri peri prawns were perfectly spiced and had just the right amount of kick, the crab fry was flavorful and fresh, and the chicken vindaloo had that rich, tangy heat you'd expect from a well-made Goan classic.\n\nWhat made it even more special was the ambiance - we sat in the beautiful outside garden, surrounded by greenery and soft lighting. It created a peaceful and relaxing vibe that paired perfectly with the meal.\n\nHighly recommend if you're looking for authentic Goan cuisine in a serene setting",
