It created a peaceful and relaxing vibe that paired perfectly with the meal.\n\nHighly recommend if you’re looking for authentic Goan cuisine in a serene setting"

              "reviewText": "The Church of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception in Panaji, Goa is a prominent landmark, often called the \"crown of Panaji\" due to its elevated position and striking white façade. Built in 1619 (though a chapel existed on the site since 1541), it's a stunning example of Portuguese Baroque architecture with a blend of Goan style. The church features a distinctive double zigzag staircase, added in the late 19th century, and houses the second-largest bell in Goa, salvaged from the ruins of the Church of Our Lady of Grace in Old Goa. Daily masses are held in English, Konkani, and Portuguese. The interior, while not overly extravagant, is colorful and features intricately carved altars. The church is beautifully illuminated at night and is a popular destination for both locals and tourists, especially during the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8th. The church is easily accessible and offers panoramic views of Panaji. I visited on 4th August 2025"

Its pristine white facade, with that iconic zigzag staircase, is both majestic and serene, making it ideal for photography and quiet contemplation.\n\nInside, the church is just as beautiful, with intricate designs and a peaceful ambiance that evokes a sense of calm. Its central location in Panaji makes it easily accessible and a great stop while exploring the city.\n\nWhether you're visiting for its spiritual significance or to admire its beauty, this church is a true gem of Goa. I recommend visiting in the evening to experience the magical charm the lights add to the surroundings. While it can get crowded on weekends, visiting on weekdays offers a more tranquil experience.\nInstagram handle : @saviathebakecook"

The food is very delicious, fresh pao is served with every gravy and the masala’s are yummy.

It has a beach view, which adds a lot of positive aspects to it. The entire setup is in white, making the space stand out.\n\nThe venue is exceptionally large, with numerous seating options, but owing to its popularity, none of the seats were vacant, and it was always crowded, which is a minor negative if you prefer a quiet environment.\n\nWhen it comes to the food, there are many options for non-vegetarians and especially for sea-food lovers , but as a vegetarian, it was difficult for me to decide what to order. However, we did order a few beverages and snacks to binge on, and they were all delicious, and the food presentation was excellent."

Their most unique addition is the performances by some talented dancers/stuntmen.\n\nThe place has some good vintage ambience along with a touch of beach themed architecture.\n\nThis place is crowded in the evening. It is not easy to get tables for dining. Book atleast two days in advance. Food is average though.\n\nTheir belly dancers, stuntmen will make your evening enjoyable. Performances start after 9pm. Loud music stops at 10 pm (Goa govt restrictions). After 10 pm you can avail yourself headphones for a silent DJ experience.\n\nThe experience was good overall. But I wish their booking or crowd management was better. They probably need to expand their concert area."

But the more I see , the more convinced I am that this isn't the type of place I would want to stay"

I saw plenty of cracks in the plaster everywhere (guesthouse and main building). The garden was being decently maintained by the nepali staff. The swimming pool was always unoccupied. Norbert's fitness studio was in the same building as the guesthouses. I loved the quietude of this gated complex. During the day, the sun beats down and bakes the place. At night, it is cool and calm. I loved the incredible views of the Zuari river, Vasco city, Mandovi river from the 7th floor although it is terribly foggy this time of year. I didn't quite like the plethora of stray indie dogs roaming all over the complex barking randomly at strangers. Would love to visit this beautiful locale again soon."

But ever since the flats have been sold me and every single person in the complex believes that there is no bigger cheat in goa than Joe Mathias.\n\nAll the glass frontage that he promised just disappeared\n\nThe sewage plant that was in the adjoining plot is being moved into the centre of the garden.\n\nThere is no parking for even half the residents, and he is planning to cut down the garden for parking.\n\nThe gym is outsourced, and he makes money out of it and it is filled with visitors, which is a huge security risk.\n\nThe swimming pool is not functional and he says that's not my problem\n\nEvery flat in every building is leaking and fungus makes some flats inhabitable...\n\nFor everything that he was asked he said i give you my word and now when we ask he says word means nothing if you don't take it in writing.  Basically he is blatantly admitting that he is a cheat.  Any query is met with the reply, i will take legal action.  Stay away from this cheat. You will regret any purchase in his complexes.\n\nIn short he will make huge promises and the day the complex is completed he turns around and says i will not do it... in fact in a meeting one of the residents said your brochure promises all this.  His reply was brochure is made to sell apartments.  It is not a legal document. We are not obligated to provide anything in the brochure.\n\nThis review is not written out of personal vendetta.  It is the frustration of each and every resident in ocean park.  You can ask any one of them."

The golden sands, swaying palm trees, and gentle waves make it perfect for a peaceful evening stroll or a relaxing day by the shore. Unlike some of Goa’s busier beaches, Miramar has a laid-back vibe, ideal for families, joggers, and those looking to unwind.\n\nSunsets here are breathtaking, with a stunning view of the Arabian Sea meeting the Mandovi River. You’ll also find street food vendors nearby serving delicious Goan snacks like bhaji pav and fresh coconut water. While swimming isn’t always recommended due to strong currents, the beach is great for enjoying the sea breeze and watching local fishermen at work.\n\nIf you're in Panaji, Miramar Beach is a must-visit spot for a quick getaway from the city's hustle."

The sea breeze is amazing, and it feels great to relax here. You can walk along the top of the bridge and enjoy stunning views of the surrounding area. The best time to visit is in the evening when you might even see ships passing by very closely. This is a worthwhile place to spend time with kids, family, and friends. Parking space is limited, but there are many shops for souvenir hunting. Water sports are also available, making it a fantastic place to spend quality time."

However, if you're looking for a lively beach with a wide sandy shore, you might prefer Baga or Palolem.\n\nPros:\n\n1. Scenic Beauty – Offers stunning views of the Arabian Sea, making it a great spot for photography.\n\n2. Peaceful Ambience – Less crowded than popular beaches like Baga and Calangute, making it ideal for relaxation.\n\n3. Dona Paula Viewpoint – A famous attraction with panoramic sea views, especially at sunrise and sunset.\n\n4. Water Sports – Activities like jet skiing, kayaking, and parasailing are available.\n\n5. Historical Significance – Named after Dona Paula de Menezes, the beach has a romantic legend associated with it.\n\nCons:\n\n1. Limited Sand Area – Unlike other Goan beaches, Dona Paula has a rocky shoreline, limiting space for sunbathing.\n\n2. Occasional Cleanliness Issues – Can get dirty due to tourist activity and littering.\n\n3. Commercialization – Nearby stalls and vendors sometimes charge higher prices for souvenirs and refreshments."

The moment I touch down, I find myself heading straight here — because nothing quite beats sitting by the beach and letting time slow down.\n\nThe approach itself has its own charm. I usually take the quieter walk up from the side, and as soon as I step onto the deck, there’s this feeling of calm that washes over me. The view opens up beautifully, the sea breeze greets you, and for those few moments, everything else fades away.\n\nCandolim strikes a rare balance — lively enough to keep the energy going, yet serene enough to just sit back, soak in the sound of the waves, and get lost in thought. It’s the kind of place that’s magical in its simplicity.\n\nWhether you’re looking to unwind with a book, sip on something refreshing, or just gaze at the endless horizon, Candolim always delivers. For me, it’s not just a beach — it’s a ritual, a pause button, and a reminder of why Goa feels so special."

It offers the kind of relaxed Goan charm that’s not overrun yet not too remote. The sand dunes and shoreline are scenic and inviting, while water activities and seaside shacks add life and flavor. Small towns and historic landmarks nearby enrich the experience.\nIf you enjoy a tranquil yet engaging beach day, topped with decent food, scenic walks, and a bit of adventure, Candolim is a solid choice. Just avoid the midday peak crowds if you're after serenity—or come early in the day and stay through sunset."

Despite the trip being primarily work-related, visiting Calangute offered a much-needed break from the formal environment and allowed for some relaxation.\n\nThe beach is lively and well-organized, with clean sands and a vibrant atmosphere. It is conveniently located and easily accessible from most business hotels in North Goa. The wide shoreline made it easy to find quieter spots even amidst the crowds, perfect for unwinding after long work hours.\n\nThere are several beachside cafes and restaurants offering a variety of cuisines, ideal for informal meetings or casual team gatherings. The Wi-Fi availability in some of these shacks was a bonus, allowing me to stay connected when necessary. The beach also has proper safety measures, including lifeguards on duty, which is reassuring.\n\nWhile it can get a little crowded during peak hours, visiting early in the morning or late evening provides a more peaceful experience. The scenic sunsets and cool sea breeze were the perfect way to de-stress after attending meetings and official engagements.\n\nOverall, Calangute Beach proved to be an excellent place to balance work and relaxation during my official trip to Goa."

Best beach for photography and enjoying sunset\n\nOur driver told us Vainguinim beach is known for its silver sand and clear greenish blue waters and attracts the tourists who are usually looking for isolation and some quiet time. This beach is surrounded by plush trees. There aren’t as many tourists here as you would find on the other beaches which is music to my ears anyways! The beach was lovely, nice relaxing and calm. There are some stall sellers but leave you alone and let you be.\n\nThis is one of the few beaches that are clean and remain uncluttered in Goa till date. Very much suitable for Kid's and family and also for youngsters in all. There are water sports like Jet ski,Para sailing,Banana ride etc.The equipment seems well maintained and the staff is also friendly enough. In all, it was a wonderful surprise that we discovered accidentally and we're more than happy for this discovery.\nNote:- Pricing is definitely on a higher side for the water sports but they make up with some long rides for that. The sports activities come to an end by 18:00 hrs in the evening.\nParasailing :- 1500/- per person with an extra 300/- if you want to get dipped in water.\nJet Ski :- 500/- for short ride and 1500/- for a longer one.\nBanana was somewhere around 900/- or so."

If you're looking for a spot to relax, reflect, or simply enjoy the rhythm of the sea, this beach delivers beautifully.\n\nWhat makes Caranzalem special is its calm atmosphere. The shoreline is clean and rarely crowded, making it perfect for a peaceful morning walk or a quiet sunset view. The gentle waves and soft breeze create a soothing ambiance that’s hard to find on the more commercial beaches.\n\nOne of the most charming sights here is watching the local fishermen at work. Early in the morning or late afternoon, you can catch them casting their nets and pulling in the day’s catch — a simple yet mesmerizing scene that gives you a glimpse into the traditional Goan way of life.\n\nIn short: Caranzalem Beach is a serene escape for those who crave quiet moments by the sea, away from the chaos. A perfect spot to unwind and reconnect with nature — and maybe even yourself."

With its long, clean shoreline and gentle waves, this beach provides a quiet escape from the crowds, making it perfect for those who want solitude or quality time in nature.\n\nThe beach is lined with swaying coconut palms and soft golden sand, giving it a calm, welcoming charm. Locals love it for morning walks, yoga, and evening strolls, thanks to its well-kept promenade and fresh sea breeze. The shallow waters and relatively quiet atmosphere make it a great spot for families, especially those with children who want to play safely by the shore.\n\nAs the sun sets, Caranzalem Beach turns into a peaceful haven bathed in golden light, where the horizon merges with the sea in a stunning view. The sight of boats sailing in the distance and the occasional appearance of dolphins only adds to its charm. With less commercial activity, the beach keeps its natural beauty and offers a true Goan coastal experience.\n\nWhether you’re watching the waves touch the sand, listening to the soothing sounds of nature, or simply enjoying a moment of calm, Caranzalem Beach leaves you feeling refreshed, grounded, and inspired. It’s a hidden oasis of tranquility in the heart of Panjim."

              "reviewText": "A visit to Reis Magos Fort, Goa\nTucked along the Mandovi River, Reis Magos Fort is one of Goa’s most captivating historical treasures. Originally established by the Adil Shah dynasty and later rebuilt by the Portuguese in 1551, this fort has seen it all — from the rule of the Portuguese, Marathas, and Mughals to becoming part of independent India.\n\nThe fort not only boasts stunning views of the Mandovi and Arabian Sea but also houses a church that's over 400 years old — the beautiful Reis Magos Church, built in 1550. Once a strategic defense point and later a prison, the fort has now been restored into a vibrant cultural and heritage center.Whether you're a history buff, architecture enthusiast, or just in search of a peaceful view, this place is definitely worth the visit!"

The fort was originally built by Adilshah and then taken over by Portuguese in. Over the years, it’s been used as a military post, a home for Viceroys, and even a prison.\n\nThe place is well-maintained now and has some great features—like thick laterite stone walls, watchtowers, underground rooms, and even a freshwater spring inside. The view of the Mandovi River from the top is amazing!\n\nIt’s right next to the Reis Magos Church, so you can visit both together. If you’re into history or just want to enjoy a peaceful spot with a view, this is a great place to check out in Goa."

The level 2 of the fort gives panoramic view of the panjim city and nearby area.\n\nBest time to visit the fort is during the monsoon season when the fort is covered with greens but be careful as it can get slippery.\n\nThe fort also houses a museum which showcases the history of the fort, names of the people who were prisoned in the fort and a Gallery showcasing the work of Mario Miranda."

Despite the off-hour, we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table, which says something about its popularity with both locals and tourists.\n\nOnce seated, we went for the Kingfish (Surmai) Thali, a staple when in Goa, and added a plate of their Rava-Fried Chonak (Barramundi) on the side. The thali was quite nice, offering the familiar Goan flavours one expects—rice, curry, fried fish, a bit of pickle, and accompaniments. However, the shellfish was noticeably missing, and while the plate was balanced, I did feel it could’ve had a bit more variety to make it feel truly complete.\n\nThe Chonak, though, was a highlight. Beautifully fried in a crisp rava coating, it was flavourful and came with a small salad. That said, it did feel a little overpriced for the portion size.\n\nTo wrap up, we ordered their Bebinca for dessert. It was delicious but disappointingly small—barely a few bites, which didn’t quite justify the cost or the craving.\n\nWorth a visit for the authentic Goan flavours and the lively vibe, but a few tweaks to the portions and pricing could really elevate the experience."

              "reviewText": "During my recent visit to Panaji, I had the pleasure of dining at Kokni kanteen, a restaurant renowned for its authentic Goan cuisine. Kokni kanteen was established in the year .1972\nThe ambience is cozy and reminding traditional Goan homes, featuring red laterite walls and vintage furnishings. It’s a perfect spot for both family gatherings and solo meals.\n\nI opted for their signature fish thaali meals, which included a variety of dishes like coconut fish curry, prawns chammanthi, chilly fish curry and rawa fried fish fry. Each item was flavorful and cooked to perfection. The kokum rasam was the variety item which was tasted first time.\n\nIt is very crowded and busy time so that the staff can’t handle everyone promptly. It is a must visit spot for anyone looking to explore Goan thaali meals. It costs Rs.320/- per head"

              "reviewText": "We had just landed in Goa and were craving an authentic Goan meal — Kokni Kanteen was our first stop, and what a fantastic choice it turned out to be! For our first lunch in Goa, we ordered the Goan Thali, and it was absolutely amazing. Every item was packed with flavor, but the star of the show was definitely the Kingfish Rawa Fry — perfectly crisp on the outside, tender and juicy inside. The accompanying dishes like the fish curry, prawns curry, and pickle were equally delightful, bringing together a wholesome and traditional Goan dining experience.\n\nSo impressed by the flavors and quality, we found ourselves back at Kokni Kanteen on Day 2! This time, we went all out — ordered the Special Thali, Kingfish Tawa Fry, and Prawns Rawa Fry, all paired with a chilled beer. It was a WOW moment all over again. The Special Thali was a feast in itself, including Crab Curry, Fish Rawa Fry, Chicken Curry, Dried Prawns Thoran, Fish Curry, Rice, Special Prawns Curry, Pickle, Kokum Juice, and more — every single item was flavorful, fresh, and authentic.\n\nThe ambience is cozy and welcoming, giving you the feeling of dining in a local Goan home. The service is top-notch — the staff is friendly, attentive, and happy to help with recommendations.\n\nAnother cool touch: the walls are adorned with pictures of celebrities who’ve visited the restaurant — a testament to its popularity and consistent quality.\n\nIf you’re in Goa and looking for authentic Goan cuisine, Kokni Kanteen should be at the top of your list. Highly recommended — and don’t leave without trying the Kingfish Fry!"

This place has limited seating and it’s a little cramped too where only one person can walk at a time.\n\nFood : we had the king fish thali which was priced at 320 per thali which I feel in comparison to other restaurants trending was reasonably priced for the quantity they served. In addition to this we also ordered kokkum soda, mussels rava fry , squid butter garlic and finished this wonderful lunch with serradura for dessert . I personally felt the starters were overpriced but the quantity was good.\nRequest to management is to improvise on crowd management. Even though there was tickets issued for the queue but if you can assign someone to handle the crowd will be great as there isn’t much place to stand inside and wait.\nAlso finding a parking can be a challenge."

Founded in 2009 by the visionary Dattaraj V. Salgaocar, this non-profit center aims to preserve Goa's artistic legacy while fostering modern creative expressions.\n\nThe term \"Sunaparanta\" is rooted in Buddhist tradition, combining \"Suna\" (a place) and \"Aparanta\" (the region of fierce people), aptly reflecting the center's bold and dynamic approach to art. Housed in a beautifully restored Portuguese bungalow, the center boasts terracotta roofs, sweeping staircases, and a central courtyard that enhances its rustic yet grand aesthetic.\n\nArt lovers can immerse themselves in a variety of exhibitions featuring both local and international artists. The center is well-known for its eclectic programming, including the annual Sensorium Festival, which explores the intersection of various art forms such as photography, literature, and cinema. Additionally, the Shanghvi Salons offer intellectually stimulating discussions with renowned personalities from the creative world.\n\nSunaparanta also hosts workshops, film screenings, and children's programs, making it a lively space for artistic engagement. Notable programs include \"Film for Thought,\" which screens critically acclaimed films, and \"In Stages,\" a theatre workshop for teenagers.\n\nThe open-air Café Al Fresco is a must-visit, serving delectable dishes in a charming setting. It’s the perfect spot to enjoy a leisurely meal while soaking in the artistic ambiance.\n\nOpen from Monday to Saturday, 10 AM to 6:30 PM, Sunaparanta is a cultural gem in Goa that transcends the typical beach-centric allure of the state. Entrance is free, though certain events may require prior registration."

You can have an Auto Riksha and go there.\nHere you can see a lot of art exhibitions. It seem like they promote young artists to showcase their creativity and ideas. Here we are welcomed with very beautiful natural shadow and great ambiance.\n\nThe theme of art exhibition may change over a couple of weeks. The entry is fully free.\nOne Cafe is also working here. Thats also very nice. Reading a nice book along with a cup of coffee is always great. Varieties of hot and cold drinks with lot of pastries/snacks items are available here.\nOne of the must visit place in Goa. Best wishes.!"

My advice - get rid of foreign sounds in your cafes, leaving only the sound of the surf (if you want - quiet Indian music is OK too) and you will get many more people from 40+ who come from other countries to just relax and get rid of sound pollutions.\nOn the plus side, the beach is relatively clean and despite the abundance of boats and howling night dogs, it still looks comfortable and safe."

The sky looked amazing with different colors, and it was a great moment to just sit and enjoy the view.\n\nPatnem Beach is not crowded like some other beaches in Goa, so it’s perfect if you want to spend quiet time.\n\nI had a great experience, I loved the place and would love to visit again."

It’s peaceful, scenic, and what makes it even more special is the river flowing right beside the beach—such a beautiful combination of sea and river.\n\nThe views are absolutely mesmerizing, with mountains in the backdrop, rocky formations along the shore, and an overall untouched natural charm. The kayaking here is also more affordable compared to other places in the South, making it totally worth it. A lovely spot to unwind, explore, and enjoy some quiet time away from the crowd."

But to go to the beach u need to take the other route and park your vehicle up on the hill and walk for about 15 mins down the hill and reach the beach. While walking you will get a nice over view of the beach.. the way to the beach is quite narrow down. The beach is not that crowded.. one can enjoy a nice peaceful sunset.. there is a water lagoon too!! Also while travelling do not litter and carry back the trash with you. Stay safe!!"
