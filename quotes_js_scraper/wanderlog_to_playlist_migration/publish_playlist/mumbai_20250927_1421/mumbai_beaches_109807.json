The atmosphere was lively, with families, friends, and children enjoying the space in their own way - whether walking, playing, or simply relaxing. There's a genuine sense of community here, and that in itself was beautiful to see ❤️🪷.\n\nFor future improvement, perhaps a focus on beach cleanliness, waste management, and better facilities would really elevate the experience 🌱🚮.

Rated 4.5/5 stars.\n\nThe beach was clean, peaceful, and not crowded, which made it perfect for swimming and relaxing. We swam from 1 PM to 6 PM, and the changing tide levels throughout the day added to the experience. Around 1 PM, the water was shallow and far from the rocks, but by 5–6 PM, the waves had risen and started hitting the stones at the edge of the beach. Sitting on those rocks and feeling the waves crash against me was just an amazing feeling.\n\nJust a heads-up-the water is extremely salty. I had a bit of discomfort in my eyes, and even got a slight ear infection, but it's all fine now after a doctor visit.\n\nWe carried biryani, had a mini picnic in the evening, and responsibly cleaned the area before leaving. There were a few local food stalls nearby too.\n\nIt's a great spot for photography, family outings, or just peace of mind.\n\nTips for first-time visitors:\n\nAvoid going deep if you don't know how to swim.\n\nCarry your own food and water-but please clean up afterward.\n\nBest time to visit is early morning or late afternoon to avoid harsh heat.\n\nThe tide level rises in the evening, so plan your swim time accordingly.\n\nDon't forget sunscreen and sunglasses!",
