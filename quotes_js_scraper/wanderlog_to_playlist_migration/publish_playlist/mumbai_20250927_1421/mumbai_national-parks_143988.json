Took a train to Borivali and then a shared auto for ₹25 to reach Sanjay Gandhi National Park. From there, I took the ₹20 shuttle bus that takes you straight to the caves. It's amazing how such a peaceful and serene spot exists in the middle of Mumbai!\n\nThe caves are well-maintained, and the history here is incredible. I was astonished by the big standing Buddha statue-it's both impressive and calming. The ancient water management system carved into the stone is fascinating-stone channels and cisterns designed to collect and guide rainwater. It's amazing how advanced the architecture was for its time.\n\nThe ancient monk cells were another highlight-small, carved-out rooms where monks once lived and meditated. Walking through them, you really feel the quiet, spiritual atmosphere of the place. It's like stepping back into a different time.\n\nI spent about 3 hours exploring every cave-be prepared for a lot of walking and stairs. Carry plenty of water, wear comfortable shoes, and take your time to appreciate the surroundings. There are plenty of shaded spots to rest, which definitely helps.\n\nA big thanks to the security guards-one of them saved me from an aggressive monkey and handed me his stick for protection. Beware of monkeys if you're carrying food-they're quick!\n\nTip: Go early to avoid the heat, keep your food sealed, and enjoy the peaceful vibe of this historical escape. It's definitely worth a visit.",

            "text": "Sanjay Gandhi National Park Visit\n\nWe started 2025 with a trip to Sanjay Gandhi National Park on 1st January. The park opens at 8 AM, and although the ticket queue was long, it was worth the wait. Entry tickets were ₹110 per person, with car parking charged at ₹50 per hour.\n\nWe walked about 7 km, taking in the serene beauty of this lush green haven in the heart of Mumbai. The experience was delightful, with scenic mountains, dense trees, playful monkeys, and deer adding to the charm. The butterfly garden was another highlight, with pretty butterflies fluttering all around.\n\nThe tiger safari, bus fair at ₹136 per person, was an incredible adventure where we spotted tigers, cubs, and a lioness.\n\nUnfortunately, we missed the toy train ride as the lanes are currently under redevelopment, but we'll be back to try it on our next visit. With so much left to explore, it's clear the park can't be fully covered in a single day. We're already planning a revisit to experience more of this incredible destination.\n\nSanjay Gandhi National Park is a perfect weekend escape, offering a blend of nature and adventure. A must-visit for anyone looking to unwind and reconnect with the outdoors!",

Its 103 per person (enterance tickets to park) ...\nThen go for bus tickets immediately next to enterance ticket counter (instead of cycling in sunny i will recommend buy bus tickets)\nYou can use same tickets to traveling inside park ..it takes u up to kaneri caves and vice versa.. 50 rs per person is the tickets.\n\nAfter you rome cave .. go for museum then flower fragrance gardens (free entry) all r walkable 5 mins circle .\nDon't waste money in buying buggy or safari (means if you can walk and enjoy)\n\nSafaris if u want to see lion n tiger then only its useful .. unless its not worth as its waste of time (suggestions depends on personal thinking)\n\nSecondly be aware of monkeys don't feed to be to close to them\nBags water all r allowed to take inside. Camera(dslr) are bit checked for restrictions.\nOnce u get inside you wont find any water filler so carry it proper before treking.\n\nCarry plenty of water .. there r multiple caves. It takes 2-3 hr if u relax and rome each of them . Don't forget to go to view Point (its cave point watching view).\n\nCanteen is available but those r closed most of time.\n\nLike the review if you find it useful",
