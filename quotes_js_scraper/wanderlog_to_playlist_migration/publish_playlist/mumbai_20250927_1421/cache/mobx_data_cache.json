Versova beach is no exception. 10 mins walking distance from Versova Metro Station.\n\nIf walking, avoid going by the slums route (near thorats barbecue misal) because there's a lot of trash and snack stalls are far. Walk a little more and take Persian Darbar's route aka Main Entrance (extra 5-10 mins walking).\n\nSharing rickshaw from the metro station will cost 20rs per person, it will drop you near the main entrance.\n\nKalkhatta Gola is for 50rs, Mix Gola is for 60rs. You can tell the vendor to make a normal Gola to avoid fancy heart shape. You can rent a beach mat for 150rs or sit on the rocks. Don't throw litter, carry your trash out with you and dispose it in a dustbin. Be responsible and enjoy!"

              "reviewText": "Versova Beach is a hidden gem nestled in the bustling city of Mumbai. With its long stretch of golden sand, the beach is perfect for an early morning stroll or winding down after a hectic day. The rhythmic sound of the waves, the cool sea breeze, and the distant call of the fishermen setting out to sea create a serene atmosphere that’s hard to find in a metro city.\n\nTop Highlights of this Beach –\n• Scenic views: Versova’s coastline offers a beautiful sunrise view with the sea reflecting soft pastels. It’s an ideal spot for photographers and nature lovers.\n• Cleanliness efforts: The beach has come a long way, thanks to regular clean-up drives organized by local volunteers. You’ll often see community members picking up plastic and debris, making the shoreline more enjoyable.\n• Community vibe: There’s a strong local presence here. Fishermen at work, kids flying kites, and families spending time together give the beach a warm, communal feel.\n\nThings to Know:\n• Crowd levels: Weekends and evenings can get busy, especially during festive seasons. If you prefer tranquility, visiting early in the morning is best.\n• Facilities: Basic amenities are available public toilets and a few food stalls serving chai, snacks, and seafood. However, don’t expect luxury cafés or upscale eateries.\n• Safety: The sea can be rough at times. Swim only in designated zones and stay near lifeguard-patrolled areas. The beach is generally safe during daylight hours.\n\nMy Experience:\nI visited on a serene weekday morning. The cool breeze, soft sand underfoot, and the sight of fishermen mending nets made it a calming escape. I joined a local clean-up drive, which added meaning to my visit. Though facilities are simple, the real charm lies in the untouched, local ambience.\n\nOverall, Versova Beach is a must-visit for anyone looking for a quieter, more authentic Ayurvedic sea-breeze escape in Mumbai. I’d recommend adding your own touch by participating in volunteer activities or simply enjoying a peaceful walk."

Clean beach with Speed boat, horse ride, Multi Utility Vehicle Ride etc. Beach has about 4-5 Restaurants where you can have meal after you roam around. Dont park you vehicle at night because of High Tide.\n\nGreat beach, seawater isn't somewhere you would put your feet in. And its hard to access, very small roads and google maps gets it wrong so you are technically on locals to find the route, google will take you to a route thats only for small vehicles, not cars.

If you have large SUVs like fortuner then you may find some difficulty taking it to beach.\n\nAnd you can take your vehicle to the beach as there is no parking on the road.\n\nThere is a bathroom at the entrance (on the left side) but not maintained at all. Ladies side is totally useless.\n\nBeach itself is good enough. It's both Rocky and Sandy so nice to take pictures and all. Fairly clean.\n\nThe main attraction for me were the lots of tiny crabs. Children enjoyed running behind them.\n\nThey have few horse rides at the beach. You will find gola walas, but I did not find corns.\n\nVerdict: It's a good beach not much crowded. So you can definitely relax and enjoy your time here.\n\nNOTE: Please note that people drink and I found broken pieces of glass bottles at the beach. Please take care of yourself and your kids."

              "reviewText": "Dadar Chowpatty, located along the scenic coastline of Mumbai, is a vibrant spot that perfectly blends local culture, street food, and a refreshing seaside atmosphere. Unlike the more tourist-heavy Girgaon Chowpatty, Dadar offers a calmer, more community-oriented vibe. The stretch is especially beautiful during sunset, with the Arabian Sea’s golden hues meeting the skyline and the iconic Bandra-Worli Sea Link visible in the distance.\n\nThe beach isn’t just for strolling—it’s a hub for fitness enthusiasts, joggers, and families enjoying an evening out. Vendors line the promenade selling classic Mumbai snacks like bhel puri, pav bhaji, and roasted corn, adding to the charm. On weekends, you’ll often find street performers, kids playing cricket, and couples enjoying the cool breeze.\n\nWhile the water isn’t ideal for swimming due to cleanliness concerns, the overall experience is more about the lively environment and the scenic views. Early mornings here are peaceful, perfect for photography or a quiet walk, whereas evenings are bustling with energy.\n\nDadar Chowpatty might not be the most glamorous beach in Mumbai, but it offers an authentic, everyday slice of the city’s coastal life—making it a must-visit for anyone who wants to see Mumbai beyond the tourist lens."

Rated 4.5/5 stars.\n\nThe beach was clean, peaceful, and not crowded, which made it perfect for swimming and relaxing. We swam from 1 PM to 6 PM, and the changing tide levels throughout the day added to the experience. Around 1 PM, the water was shallow and far from the rocks, but by 5–6 PM, the waves had risen and started hitting the stones at the edge of the beach. Sitting on those rocks and feeling the waves crash against me was just an amazing feeling.\n\nJust a heads-up—the water is extremely salty. I had a bit of discomfort in my eyes, and even got a slight ear infection, but it’s all fine now after a doctor visit.\n\nWe carried biryani, had a mini picnic in the evening, and responsibly cleaned the area before leaving. There were a few local food stalls nearby too.\n\nIt’s a great spot for photography, family outings, or just peace of mind.\n\nTips for first-time visitors:\n\nAvoid going deep if you don’t know how to swim.\n\nCarry your own food and water—but please clean up afterward.\n\nBest time to visit is early morning or late afternoon to avoid harsh heat.\n\nThe tide level rises in the evening, so plan your swim time accordingly.\n\nDon’t forget sunscreen and sunglasses!"

The beach itself was clean, though it tends to get quite crowded on weekends and holidays. The entry is rather narrow, which can be a bit of a squeeze during peak times. As I walked along the shoreline, I couldn’t help but notice the stunning, high-profile bungalows dotting the area, adding a sense of luxury to the surroundings. It’s a lovely spot to unwind, whether you're with a companion or a group of friends. Watching the sunset here was truly mesmerizing and definitely worth experiencing."

Nothing beats the magical experience of sitting by the promenade, listening to the soothing sound of the Arabian Sea waves, and watching the world go by. The endless stretch is peaceful yet full of life, where you can see families, couples, friends, and fitness enthusiasts all enjoying the same beautiful view. Sunrises here bring calmness, sunsets paint the sky with breathtaking colors, and nights transform the curve into the sparkling ‘Queen’s Necklace,’ making it absolutely enchanting. Street-side chai, cool breeze, and the vibrant city lights add to the unforgettable vibe. Marine Drive is more than just a place — it’s an emotion that every visitor must experience.A must-visit in Mumbai — peaceful, scenic, and lively at the same time. Whether it’s sunrise or midnight, Marine Drive never disappoints. ” 🌊🌆✨"

Then there were so many people playing cricket and football. These drinking people were getting hurt by football and cricket balls but they were anyways sitting. We then found this place a bit away from beach where one can sit on stones and see beach from far, that was nice. The way to this beach is also nice, worth taking."

As soon as you enter you will be welcomed by a hoard of puppies. The beach is very clean and has bushes on the right side and houses on the left. It has two entrances and cops do visit from time to time so avoid drinking booze in the open. There are no food vendors on the beach so you have to get everything yourself. Smoke shop, alcohol shop and restaurants are situated nearby. It is better to come here on a 2 or 4 wheeled vehicle. You can either come here though madh jetty or you can come here by road through Malad. If you are looking to speand some peaceful time with you family and friends this is the place. You will see locals coming out to the beach for a walk after dinner. Do not enter the bush area after dark specially if you are with your lady as locals sit there to drink. Over all this is a good place to watch the sunset or just a couple hours at the beach."

It’s less crowded compared to Juhu Beach, which adds to its charm and tranquility.\n\nOne of the highlights of Versova Beach is its stunning sunsets. The view of the sun dipping into the Arabian Sea is truly mesmerizing and perfect for photography enthusiasts. It’s also a popular spot for locals to enjoy some fresh seafood from nearby stalls.\n\nWhile the beach has its natural beauty, occasional littering can still be an issue.

              "reviewText": "Dadar Beach, often overshadowed by the more famous Juhu and Marine Drive, is a hidden gem right in the middle of Mumbai. Located near the bustling area of Dadar, this beach offers a peaceful escape from the city’s hectic pace. It may not be as polished as other Mumbai beaches, but that’s where its charm lies—it’s raw, authentic, and closer to the everyday life of Mumbaikars.\n\nWhen you visit Dadar Beach, the first thing you’ll notice is the calm atmosphere. The crowds are much smaller here, making it an ideal spot for those who want to enjoy some quiet time by the sea. The beach is especially popular among locals who come here for their morning and evening walks, to sit by the shore, or just to watch the sunset. And let me tell you, the sunsets here are truly something special—when the sun dips into the Arabian Sea, the sky lights up with beautiful shades of orange and pink. It’s a sight that stays with you long after you leave.\n\nAnother unique aspect of Dadar Beach is its proximity to Chaitya Bhoomi, the memorial of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. This adds a layer of cultural and historical significance to the area, making it more than just a spot for leisure.\n\nWhile the beach may not have the fancy eateries or tourist amenities of Juhu, it’s the simplicity and serenity of Dadar Beach that makes it so special. It’s a place where you can connect with the sea, the city, and perhaps even yourself. For anyone looking to experience the quieter side of Mumbai, Dadar Beach is definitely worth a visit."

              "reviewText": "Ah, Mahim Beach! It’s one of the more understated beaches in Mumbai, compared to its more famous counterparts like Juhu or Marine Drive, but it has its own charm.\n\n### Mahim Beach Overview:\n- **Location**: Situated in the Mahim area, this beach offers a quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai city. It's located near the Mahim Causeway, making it fairly accessible.\n\n- **Scenic View**: The beach offers views of the Arabian Sea, but the surrounding environment isn’t as pristine as some of the more popular beaches in Mumbai. There's a view of the Mahim Bay and the Bandra-Worli Sea Link from a distance, though it’s not as iconic as the one from the Bandra Sea Face area.\n\n- **Atmosphere**: It’s generally a quieter spot compared to other beaches. On weekdays, it’s calm, but on weekends, it can attract some locals. You’ll find people strolling, playing cricket, or simply sitting and enjoying the breeze. However, the beach isn’t the cleanest, which can be a turn-off for some visitors.\n\n- **Activities**: While Mahim Beach isn't particularly famous for water sports, you can often find people walking along the shore or kids playing. It’s more of a spot for relaxation and casual visits.\n\n- **Nearby Attractions**: The famous **Mahim Dargah** is located close to the beach, which is a popular religious site. There are also some cafes and small eateries nearby, so grabbing a bite is never a problem.\n\n### Pros:\n- **Less Crowded**: Compared to other beaches like Juhu or Marine Drive, Mahim Beach tends to be less crowded, offering a more laid-back experience.\n- **Local Vibe**: The area feels authentically Mumbai, with local vendors, small shops, and residents going about their daily lives.\n\n### Cons:\n- **Cleanliness**: The beach isn’t as well-maintained as other tourist-heavy beaches in the city. You may find some litter and debris around the shore.\n- **Water Quality**: Like many other Mumbai beaches, the water quality isn’t great for swimming. It's not the most ideal beach for water activities.\n\n### Final Thoughts:\nMahim Beach isn’t the most glamorous beach in Mumbai, but it offers a quieter, local experience. If you’re looking for a more peaceful, off-the-beaten-path location to unwind, it's a good choice. Just keep your expectations in check regarding cleanliness and amenities."

A dirty place with garbage all around. The place stinks from dirty water and garbage.\nIt's mostly overcrowded and you can spot drug addicts.\nI had a really unpleasant experience while taking a narrow path to the coconut tree lane. Thankfully I was with my brother. It's not a safe place where females can roam around freely so avoid going there.\nThere are no water sports activities but food options are available which can fill up your tummy."

You can reach easily and fast if don’t have your own vehicle. But worth visit this place.\nOnly 2-3 beach activities are there like horse riding and sand bike riding. Nothing much for kids apart from beach fun.\nSmall food stalls are there , enough to fill your tummy.\nI love going here because of less crowded.

Unlike the crowded sandy beaches often found near major cities, Pirwadi offers a unique charm with its mix of sand and distinct rocky stretches. This makes it an ideal spot for leisurely strolls, collecting seashells, or simply unwinding by the sea.\nThe real highlight of Pirwadi Nagaon Beach is its breathtaking sunsets. The sky transforms into a canvas of vibrant colors, creating a truly magical experience that is perfect for photography or quiet contemplation. While not traditionally suited for swimming due to its rocky nature and sometimes murky water, the calm ambiance more than makes up for it.\nVisitors often appreciate the relaxed atmosphere, making it a great destination for a family outing or a serene evening with friends. You can find small food stalls nearby offering local snacks and fresh seafood, adding to the authentic coastal experience. The approach road is generally good, and parking is usually not an issue, making it a convenient day trip from Navi Mumbai.\nThough it might not be a sprawling sandy beach for water sports, Pirwadi Nagaon Beach stands out for its tranquility and picturesque views. It's a wonderful place to reconnect with nature, enjoy beautiful sunsets, and simply breathe in the fresh sea air."

During monsoon it can get a little dirty near the coast lines but it gets cleaned so there should be no problem faced by people. The poles reflect lights which say swach Bharat which is a great initiative to bring more cleanliness to the beach. I love how the people are also very cooperative and friendly not rude at all. Overall a good place to spend time with your date, family, friends etc. I go there daily so cheers if you find me."

As someone used to the white sands and clear waters of South African beaches 🇿🇦🏖️, I found the beach here quite different — the sand was darker, and the water had a brownish hue, which might surprise first-time visitors.\n\nThat said, it’s clear that Silver Beach holds local charm and significance 🌅👨‍👩‍👧‍👦. The atmosphere was lively, with families, friends, and children enjoying the space in their own way — whether walking, playing, or simply relaxing. There’s a genuine sense of community here, and that in itself was beautiful to see ❤️🪷.\n\nFor future improvement, perhaps a focus on beach cleanliness, waste management, and better facilities would really elevate the experience 🌱🚮. Even small steps could help preserve and celebrate this natural space, not just for locals but for visitors from across the country and abroad 🌍🙏🏾.\n\n“ప్రతి సముద్రతీరానికి దాని సొంత కథ ఉంది.”\n(Every beach has its own story.) 🌊📖"

It’s definitely a quieter spot compared to the main Juhu Beach — less crowd, more space to sit and relax, which I really appreciated. However, the overall experience was affected by the poor condition of the beach.\n\nThere’s a strong, unpleasant smell — something like rotten waste — that hits you as soon as you arrive. The pollution here is quite noticeable, with garbage scattered along the shore and in the water. It’s unfortunate because the place has potential to be a clean and serene coastal spot.\n\nWould love to see the authorities take better care of this beach. It could be a hidden gem if maintained properly."

The pass must be available on Sundays too.\nThe ticket window opens at 8.00 a.m. only.\nThey should make arrangements to start earliest by 7.00 a.m. Public can start by 7.00 a.m. and by the time Sun starts spreading its heat, people can start returning.\nThe carvings are beautiful, it is difficult to understand how in those days people must have carved in the Rock?\nDrainage system, fresh water pockets all well thought and seen.\nThe famous Buddhist Stupas are seen at various Caves.\nFew Caves are situated at an elevated levels.\nSculptures are marvelous but few are damaged mat be by the Invaders in those times.\nSecurity is stationed at all levels. WashRoom facility is available. Even Canteen facility is available, picnic tables are layed for people to enjoy there breakfast or snacks.\nOne should be careful of the Monkeys, they are spread in all the areas.\nIt is mind boggling to see such architectural beauty of those times when proper instruments erre not available but still people have worked and have made such wonders.\nOne has to see it physically to experience this fact.\nAt each Cave an inscription is displayed, explaining the details of that particular Cave.\nArcheological Society has constructed few steps with railings for people to climb up the levels."

              "reviewText": "Visited: November 2024\n\nI'm an explorer who loves to visit historical and archaeological places, and Kanheri Caves was a real treat! Took a train to Borivali and then a shared auto for ₹25 to reach Sanjay Gandhi National Park. From there, I took the ₹20 shuttle bus that takes you straight to the caves. It’s amazing how such a peaceful and serene spot exists in the middle of Mumbai!\n\nThe caves are well-maintained, and the history here is incredible. I was astonished by the big standing Buddha statue—it’s both impressive and calming. The ancient water management system carved into the stone is fascinating—stone channels and cisterns designed to collect and guide rainwater. It’s amazing how advanced the architecture was for its time.\n\nThe ancient monk cells were another highlight—small, carved-out rooms where monks once lived and meditated. Walking through them, you really feel the quiet, spiritual atmosphere of the place. It’s like stepping back into a different time.\n\nI spent about 3 hours exploring every cave—be prepared for a lot of walking and stairs. Carry plenty of water, wear comfortable shoes, and take your time to appreciate the surroundings. There are plenty of shaded spots to rest, which definitely helps.\n\nA big thanks to the security guards—one of them saved me from an aggressive monkey and handed me his stick for protection. Beware of monkeys if you’re carrying food—they’re quick!\n\nTip: Go early to avoid the heat, keep your food sealed, and enjoy the peaceful vibe of this historical escape. It’s definitely worth a visit."

The way to reach has also been well designed along with the convenience of the bust taking you up to the caves from the National park entrance. The tickets are reasonably priced. Additionally there is the tiger safari, park, boating etc. which you could do if you have time. Do carry water and some little eatables as the trek is a bit long and definitely not for elders or very small children."

The park opens at 8 AM, and although the ticket queue was long, it was worth the wait. Entry tickets were ₹110 per person, with car parking charged at ₹50 per hour.\n\nWe walked about 7 km, taking in the serene beauty of this lush green haven in the heart of Mumbai. The experience was delightful, with scenic mountains, dense trees, playful monkeys, and deer adding to the charm. The butterfly garden was another highlight, with pretty butterflies fluttering all around.\n\nThe tiger safari, bus fair at ₹136 per person, was an incredible adventure where we spotted tigers, cubs, and a lioness.\n\nUnfortunately, we missed the toy train ride as the lanes are currently under redevelopment, but we’ll be back to try it on our next visit. With so much left to explore, it’s clear the park can’t be fully covered in a single day. We’re already planning a revisit to experience more of this incredible destination.\n\nSanjay Gandhi National Park is a perfect weekend escape, offering a blend of nature and adventure. A must-visit for anyone looking to unwind and reconnect with the outdoors!"

Its 103 per person (enterance tickets to park) ...\nThen go for bus tickets immediately next to enterance ticket counter (instead of cycling in sunny i will recommend buy bus tickets)\nYou can use same tickets to traveling inside park ..it takes u up to kaneri caves and vice versa.. 50 rs per person is the tickets.\n\nAfter you rome cave .. go for museum then flower fragrance gardens (free entry) all r walkable 5 mins circle .\nDon't waste money in buying buggy or safari (means if you can walk and enjoy)\n\nSafaris if u want to see lion n tiger then only its useful .. unless its not worth as its waste of time (suggestions depends on personal thinking)\n\nSecondly be aware of monkeys don't feed to be to close to them\nBags water all r allowed to take inside. Camera(dslr) are bit checked for restrictions.\nOnce u get inside you wont find any water filler so carry it proper before treking.\n\nCarry plenty of water .. there r multiple caves. It takes 2-3 hr if u relax and rome each of them . Don't forget to go to view Point (its cave point watching view).\n\nCanteen is available but those r closed most of time.\n\nLike the review if you find it useful"

The moment you enter, it feels like you’ve stepped into another world — peaceful, green, and full of life. It’s hard to believe something this calm exists within the city.\n\nI visited early in the morning, and the air was fresh and cool. Walking through the forest trails with birds chirping all around was such a refreshing experience. I also rented a cycle and explored the park a bit deeper — totally worth it if you enjoy riding through nature.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the Kanheri Caves. Climbing up to the caves, with all the ancient carvings and the view of the forest from the top, felt like stepping into history. It’s both peaceful and awe-inspiring.\n\nWhat I love most about the park is how it balances natural beauty with easy access. Whether you're into trekking, cycling, photography, or just sitting quietly among trees, this place has something for everyone. I left feeling lighter, calmer, and a little more connected to nature.\n\nHighly recommend spending a few hours here — especially if you live in Mumbai and just need to breathe."

Then the fee will be 80rupi for 2h.\nThe road is mostly flat.\nYou will need to park the bicycle and to walk about 1km to get to the cave site.\nThere are many toilets around and small stands that sell drinks and fruits.\n\nWhat to bring:\nA lot of water\nMoney\nID (for bicycle)\nCap and sports clothing (be ready to sweat)\n\nCost\nThe day I came it was a public holiday so entry was free.\nBicycle 80rupi/2h\nEntrance to cave 300rupi (for foreigners)"

However at one end of the TMC garden.. a narrow 100m long bridge opens up in this Beautiful place. It has a narrow footpath that spirals through the garden. And the sides are covered with plants which are full of colorful flowers. Won't take more than 10 mins to walk in and out of the garden. We spotted only one butterfly but I guess, there should be some season when we would have many butterflies."

              "reviewText": "This is absolutely a worthwhile experience and highly recommended for visitors. The journey involves a scenic boat ride to and from the cave site, which, although lengthy, is rewarding upon arrival. Safety measures are in place on the boats, including the provision of life jackets.\n\nBe prepared for long queues while boarding the ferry, especially during peak hours. It is advisable to carry essentials such as a cap or umbrella, drinking water, and sunscreen, as the area can be quite sunny and hot. Proper preparation will help ensure a more comfortable and enjoyable experience.\n\nThe ferry ride costs approximately ₹250 for a round trip. Upon arrival, visitors can either walk to the ticket counter or take a toy train, which costs around ₹10. The entry fee to the caves is about ₹40. You’ll also find several small outlets selling refreshments, along with shops offering souvenirs such as magnets, bags, and unique antiques.\n\nIt’s advisable to allocate at least 5–6 hours to fully explore the site and enjoy the experience at a relaxed pace. Conveniently located near the Gateway of India, this makes for a culturally rich and enjoyable day trip."

Which will take around 1 hour. Average Cost of boat is around 300Rs. Be aware of monkeys. There is one toy train running from jetty to the gate which is very useful if you are with kids or elderly persons. You cab not stay there in night, so have to leave the island before sunset by last boat."

Best to visit when there are more tourists otherwise you may wait 30–60 mins for the boat, which feels like a waste of time."

              "reviewText": "Visiting the Elephanta Caves is like stepping into a living monument of India’s spiritual and artistic glory. Located on a tranquil island just a ferry ride from the Gateway of India, these rock-cut caves are believed to have been created during the mid-5th to 6th century CE, most likely under the rule of the Kalachuri dynasty, a Hindu dynasty known for their patronage of Shaivism (worship of Lord Shiva).\n\nThe highlight is the great cave (Cave 1) dedicated to Lord Shiva, which houses the magnificent Trimurti—a 20-foot-tall three-headed sculpture representing Shiva as the Creator (Aghora), Preserver (Tatpurusha), and Destroyer (Vamadeva). This masterpiece, along with other panels like the Shiva Nataraja, Ardhanarishvara, and Gangadhara, reflects both exquisite artistry and deep religious symbolism.\n\nThese caves are more than just archaeological wonders—they are sacred spaces shaped by devotion, echoing the beliefs and aesthetics of ancient Hindu culture. Every intricately carved shrine and sculpture whispers stories from a time when Shaivite worship thrived in full grandeur.\n\nDespite multiple visits, the experience never loses its impact. The peaceful island, ancient carvings, and spiritual atmosphere make it a must-visit for history lovers, art enthusiasts, and spiritual seekers alike.\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site that embodies India’s Hindu heritage—Elephanta is not just a place to see, but a place to feel. 🕉️"

I had been here around 10-12 years ago during my college days, and at that time, the garden was absolutely beautiful. It used to be very big, full of colorful flowers, well-maintained green grass, and spacious sitting areas — the whole atmosphere was so peaceful and fresh.\n\nBut now, most of the area has been reduced, there are very few flowers, and the green grass has almost disappeared. The beauty and charm which it had earlier is definitely missing now. I still remember how beautiful it used to be during my college days — full of greenery, colorful flowers, and spacious sitting areas. I miss that charm.\n\nGiving 4 stars only because of the memories attached to this place.😊"

              "reviewText": "Timeless Tranquility Above the Arabian Sea: Hanging Gardens, Mumbai\n\nNestled atop Malabar Hill, floating gently above the city’s din and overlooking the Arabian Sea, the Hanging Gardens of Mumbai—officially known as Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens—offer a sanctuary not just of greenery, but of perspective. This is not merely a public garden; it is a verdant amphitheatre of history, memory, and floral artistry, gracefully perched above the chaos of one of the world’s most populous cities.\n\nLaid out in 1881 during the British colonial era, the gardens were named after Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, a prominent Indian political leader, barrister, and municipal reformer often dubbed the “Father of Bombay Municipality.” These terraced gardens were strategically designed atop a vast water reservoir built in 1880 to protect the potable water stored beneath from contamination—a rare fusion of aesthetic charm and functional urban planning. The term “hanging” refers to their tiered structure, reminiscent of the ancient Hanging Gardens of Babylon, though in a uniquely Mumbai avatar.\n\nSpread over 3.5 hectares, the gardens are a botanical canvas of seasonal blooms, trimmed hedges shaped into peacocks and elephants, and walking paths lined with bougainvillea and hibiscus. Early mornings here are cloaked in dew and golden silence, while evenings unfurl a soft breeze laden with the scent of champa and nostalgia.\n\nThe gardens serve not only as a leisure spot but also as a historic lookout point. From the stone-laced edges of the garden, one can gaze upon the Queen’s Necklace—the crescent curve of Marine Drive sparkling at dusk like a diadem of diamonds. The panoramic views extend to Chowpatty Beach and the domes of colonial Mumbai, framed by frangipani branches and monsoon clouds. On clear days, you can trace the outline of Back Bay and the far-off industrial silhouettes of Mumbai’s docks, all quietly pulsating beneath you.\n\nWhat’s lesser known is the role this garden has played in Mumbai’s socio-cultural evolution. Malabar Hill, where it resides, has long been home to the city’s governors, business magnates, and cultural stalwarts. The garden has been a silent witness to morning walks of poets, twilight musings of artists, and first dates under lampposts. It has absorbed the shifting decades—from the horse-drawn carriages of colonial Bombay to the digital hush of smartphone joggers today.\n\nFlora-wise, the garden is home to more than 300 plant species, from native shrubs to exotic ornamental trees. The iconic topiary animals are pruned with extraordinary dedication—a form of green sculpture that evokes both whimsy and discipline. Birdsong is a regular visitor, with over 40 species documented in the area. And if you come at sunrise, you may catch a fleeting glimpse of parakeets, mynas, and even the occasional Brahminy kite soaring above the palm-lined horizon.\n\nThe gardens are open to the public from 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily, and entry is entirely free—a democratic gift of peace in the middle of a bustling megapolis. Benches are generously placed under ancient banyans and jamun trees, and the walking loops stretch to about 1.2 kilometers—perfect for a meditative morning or leisurely evening stroll. Adjacent to the Hanging Gardens lies Kamala Nehru Park, forming a twin green space that doubles the delight for walkers and picnickers alike.\n\nIt’s easy to forget that beneath your feet lies one of the city’s largest water tanks, built during the late 19th century to supply fresh drinking water to South Mumbai. To build a blooming paradise atop a utilitarian tank speaks volumes of the city’s ability to balance necessity and beauty—a rare feat, especially in the urban sprawl of modern India.\n\nIn a city constantly negotiating between its past and its future, the Hanging Gardens offer a still point—a place where history lingers not in museums, but in the fragrance of flowering shrubs and the silence between leaves.\n\nCome not just for a walk—but to rediscover how quietly a city can exhale."

              "reviewText": "The Jogeshwari Caves, located in the Mumbai suburb of Jogeshwari, are an ancient rock-cut complex and one of India’s oldest cave temples. Estimated to have been created around 520–550 AD, these caves are believed to be one of the earliest and largest in Maharashtra, showcasing a remarkable blend of history, spirituality, and architectural skill.\nUpon entering, you’re struck by the grand scale of the caves. A long corridor lined with impressive columns and ancient carvings leads to the main sanctum, where a massive idol of the Hindu goddess Jogeshwari (also known as Yogeshwari or Ambika) is enshrined. The presence of Lord Shiva and other Hindu deities also points to the site's roots in the Hindu faith, likely associated with early Shaivism. The structures here show evidence of skilled craftsmanship, with finely detailed carvings depicting mythological scenes, deities, and various symbols associated with Hindu iconography.\nHowever, the caves’ current state is somewhat disappointing. Over the years, urbanization and neglect have taken their toll. Parts of the caves are damaged, with cracks in pillars and eroded carvings. Encroachment and pollution have also affected the atmosphere, diminishing the serene environment one might expect at such a historical site. Additionally, insufficient lighting and lack of maintenance make parts of the cave difficult to explore.\nDespite these issues, the Jogeshwari Caves offer a fascinating glimpse into ancient India’s religious and architectural past, reminding visitors of Mumbai’s deep historical roots. For history and art lovers, the caves are an essential visit, though improvements in preservation and visitor facilities could greatly enhance the experience."

The caves date back to the sixth century, Chalukya dynasty. They were found during the excavation of Ajanta and Elephanta. These caves belong to the Hindu deity Jogeshwari.\nThe caves are divided into two parts. The part down side is dark and some temples are present there where local people come for worship.\nThe caves are located off the Western Express Highway, and are surrounded by encroachments. The caves are accessed through a long flight of stairs into the main hall of this cavernous space. It has many pillars and a lingam at the end. There are also relics of two doorkeepers. The cave also has a idol of the goddess Jogeshwari, after whom the area is named.\nIf you like and have some spare time, you can come here for a quick visit."

              "reviewText": "A Family Adventure at Tiger Safari, Sanjay Gandhi National Park!\n\nWe recently visited the Tiger Safari at Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Borivali with my family, and it turned out to be an good experience that left all of us captivated.\n\nHere's a more comprehensive review:\n\n🚗 **Parking Facility:**\n\nThe journey began smoothly with a hassle-free parking experience. The paid parking facility was well-organized, and it was convenient to reach the entrance, making our family outing off to a great start.\n\n💸 **Entry Fees:**\n\nUpon reaching the entrance gate, we took the entry tickets, Rs. 94 for adults and Rs. 50 for kids (5 to 12 years).\n\n🚶‍♂️ * Tiger and Lion Safari ticket counter Ticket Counter:**\n\nAfter entering, we walked approximately 400 meters to reach the Tiger and Lion Safari ticket counter. The additional ticket costs Rs. 108 for adults and Rs. 43 for kids (5 to 12 years).\n\n🚌 **Bus Options:**\n\nWe have the convenience of having both A/C and non-A/C buses available from the pick-up point, catering to the preferences of the tourists.\n\n🌳 **Park Setting:**\n\nThe park, though not very deep, was lush and replanted, creating a pleasant atmosphere. The presence of settled communities inside the park added a unique dimension to the surroundings, providing a glimpse of harmonious coexistence.\n\n🦁🐅 **Wildlife Encounter:**\n\nWhile the lions seemed less active during our visit, the highlight was the tiger encounter. One of the tigers approached our bus freely, providing a truly amazing and thrilling experience. The kids were especially enthralled by the close proximity to these majestic creatures, adding an extra layer of excitement to our family outing.\n\n⏰ **Duration of the Ride:**\n\nThe overall safari ride lasted about 20-25 minutes, but every moment was packed with excitement and awe. The short duration worked well for keeping the kids engaged and interested throughout the experience.\n\n🌅 **Best Times to Visit:**\n\nI would highly recommend planning your safari during the morning or evening, especially if you're visiting with family and kids. The lighting at these times enhances the beauty of the surroundings, and it's when wildlife tends to be more active, providing a more immersive experience for everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, the Tiger Safari at Sanjay Gandhi National Park is a good 3-4 hour engagement for a family adventure."

We were able to see lion and tiger and both were very healthy.\nIt's good to see that jungle people are taking good care of them.\nThe cost is 70 Rs and kids 28 for kids\nThere is no cost for children below 5\nVideo shooting cost you and it needs permission.

Also when we went there in afternoon timing all the animals were sleeping so we were unable to see them walking or doing anything except sleeping. So I would suggest everyone who are planning to visit Tiger and Lion safari to visit in morning timing when all the animals will be awake (😂😂) and one more very important thing try to sit on the left side window of the bus cause animals appear on that side only!!!"

              "reviewText": "Basically there are tigers, tigress', a lion and a lioness, just like zoo they are kept in cages but huge cages. As and when required, they release any one of them, out of the cage and let it roam in the jungle which is the only thing which makes this safari cool. Small roads between the jungle, gives that fearsome feel. Overall a good thing with kids. Overall a 10 minute journey costs you 90rs. Fair deal. Earlier there used to lion and tiger safari differently but now they are same. Try to be seated on the left hand side and ask the driver if you can get the front seat, it will help you get a clearer picture. ;) Enjoy"

You will understand why I said so after you take these timings. There is the best view of both the lion and tigers feeding and roaming on the roads at this time. The caves are also quite good."

Tried bombil (Bombay duck) fry for starter and it’s very delicious. Then tried surmai and bangda thali rand it didn’t disappointed us. Highly recommend this place compare to near by so called Malvani restaurants(Ratnagiri restaurant and bar) who claim they serve fresh sea food but every time ended up serving with frozen fish"

I placed my order at 8:39 PM IST and received it only at 10:00 PM, after I had already taken my gastro medication and was in urgent need of food.\n\nDespite calling them directly, there was no urgency or courtesy. The woman who answered the phone was rude, arrogant, and completely unhelpful.\n\nOn top of the delay, the quality was pathetic – the fish was clearly frozen, not fresh, and the taste, portion size, and quality were third class. All this after paying a hefty amount.\n\nThis was one of the most irresponsible and disappointing food experiences I’ve ever had. Definitely not worth your time, money, or health."

A must visit for all sea food lovers!\n\nNot recommended if you're looking for a fancy restaurant with impressive ambience, which serves multicuisine. Their speciality is only Malwani food.\n\nOrdering sea food thalis seem logical than going for a la carte. You also get chicken and mutton thali here.\n\nBeen here many times since it's close to my home. Bombil fry is crispy and palatable - highly recommended. Chicken Wade - a popular Malwani dish is also recommended if you want something in chicken.\n\nSurmai, Special Prawns or Pompret thali - the choice is yours and it's a hard one as all of them are super."

A 5 minutes joy ride to the trek point of Elephanta caves entrance area. It costs you ₹10 per person which is a return ticket even if you don’t wish to take any ticket then you can walk and enjoy the walk. I took the ride and experienced it to feel the vibes around.Now the tracks have worn out and the seats jumps every now and then whenever it passes over thes rail joints. Overall it is ok ok.Prefered for kids and senior citizens."

Get into the train from from where the boat (launch) from Mumbai dropped you in the isnant.\n\nBuy ticket from the kiosk at the starting point of the ride.\n\nIt's a 5 minutes joyride to the the point trek to the caves start. If you choose to walk, you'll cover it in 10 minutes.\n\nTrain is usually crowed and many people chose to walk and explore. They reach at end point before the people who wait in queue for the train at th same time."

The view is amazing from the top. All these years I've been in Mumbai, but I didn't know about this amazing hidden location in Dahisar. We visited this place on a weekend by taking the 462 AC bus from Borivali station the East side exit. The climb from here is through a small village here. Vaghdevi Waterfall was a great trek and a good place to enjoy waterfalls during monsoons. You could visit this place with your friends. There's also another exit towards Mira Road side, if you take the longer walking route. One negative aspect is that some people come here and indulge in consuming alcohol and throw the bottles there on the path which is dangerous for people and with the other people throwing plastic waste here it's just destroying the flora and fauna. It's a highly recommended place if you're looking for an adventurous weekend with your friends. This place is a gem in monsoons, enjoying the waterfall and nature in the rains with amazing scenic views. The view from the top is totally worth the climb."

Consider this when you are taking a huge group as everyone will not be able to make it through.\n-The trekk will definitely be exhausting for first timers.\n-Try to reach at top with only one break as muscles will tighten if you take more breaks and it will be tough to complete then.\n-Urge you guys not to leave trekk half way as reaching at the top is worth it.\n-Take only sips of water and don't drink a lot while climbing.\n\nThings to carry:\n-Some eatables(Protein bars chips etc)\n- 2 bottles of water per person.\n\nAttire:\n-Shoes (Compulsorily)\n-Tracks or shorts\n-T shirt\n\nPLEASE DONT THROW WASTE AROUND.

Located very near to Dahisar and Borivali the waterfall is just a couple of minutes drive from the highway. You will need to have a 15 20 min trek to reach the place. The view and the vibe is quite magical in the busy stress of Mumbai life after a struggle of 20 min of trek. Do visit during monsoon time but be careful while treking as the routes are slippery and in the middle of dense jungle"

Most of the professors prefer to read out on the PowerPoint.\n👉🏻 Every year more than 70 students took admission here & in the end only 20 students remain here.\nThat’s why they’re not doing entrance examination here."

It was closed for a few Years for Repairs though...but glad to have her back. I was surprised to see this train has featured in a few movies too...most notably...Amar, Akbar,Anthony it's in a song called \"humko tumsey ho gaya hai pyaar kya karein\" check this out on YouTube.. this train has two stations only Krishnagiri & Teenmurty...they used to have a stop here just for Fun like a real train...but they don't stop anymore...the ride is about 15-20 minutes in an almost 8 formation complete with hills, bridges, tunnels the beauty of this place really shows during the monsoons when everything is Green and Flowering...Always a pleasure to ride this beautiful train..thank you for a wonderfull experience :)"
