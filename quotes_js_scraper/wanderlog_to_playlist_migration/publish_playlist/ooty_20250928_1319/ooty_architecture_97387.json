The service was just as bad; there was only one waiter who was rude and argued with me. The dining area had flies and even cockroaches, which made the experience very unpleasant.\n- **Room**: While the rooms were decent, they were overshadowed by poor service and cleanliness issues. The towels had a bad smell, adding to the overall discomfort.\n- **Room Service**: Room service was practically non-existent. Every time I needed something, it felt like no one was around to help.\nOverall, this kind of service can seriously hurt the reputation of the business. I wouldn't recommend Lawley Institute to anyone and suggest looking for better options instead.",
