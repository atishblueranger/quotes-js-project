Also the beautiful view of the hills in the distance was mesmerizing.

The moment I walked in, I was surrounded by lush green plants and the charming architecture that reflects the British colonial era. It really stands out with its old-world charm.\n\nInside the church, it was incredibly quiet—which gave me a nice moment to just relax and slow down. The interior is well-maintained, especially the vintage furniture that’s still in great shape. Just a heads-up: I didn’t notice any toilet facilities available there, so plan accordingly.\n\nGetting there by public transport was simple and added to the experience. I took a bus from Ooty main bus stand. Right near the railway station entrance, there’s a small mini-bus stand. Hop on the one going towards Hill Bunk Junction—the ride is about ₹10 and only takes 5 minutes. Once you get off, the church is a short 500-meter walk. Just follow Google Maps.\n\n✨ Bonus tip for explorers: Instead of the main road, take the small slope path to the left after getting off at Hill Bunk. It’s a more scenic and peaceful walk.\n\nDefinitely worth visiting for history lovers and those looking for a calm spot in the middle of Ooty. 🙏"

The food was delicious and the portions were very generous. We also had a fireplace in our room which was lit for us after dinner. The rooms are quite chilly at night but given the age of the building it’s expected. Also we had a radiator which was a huge help. The beds are very comfortable. The one downside is we couldn’t get any herbal teas or cappuccinos. Would be great to have that choice."

The one we stayed in had one master bedroom one kids rooms with two single beds , one common area with fireplace one common bathroom and one more toilet with the dressing area .\n2nd - it had vintage cottage vibes but it was really well kept and everything was neat and tidy .\n3rd - the whole premise of the property is very well kept and maintained .\n4th - food was also good but we only took breakfast there.\n5th - the staff was courteous and were very keen on giving the guests their privacy throughout the stay .\nNow there were some things which slightly bothered us there like 1. The place was very quite and if u r going with small kids it’s not n ideal place .\n2. It’s a club so it had some rules like - kids were not allowed to sit in common dining room , there was separate dining room for kids. We ended up sitting in kids dining room as we were not comfortable with leaving her alone .\n3. U have to b properly dressed while entering the bar , dining area or the main building of the club. My sis was asked to leave the kids dining area as she was wearing distressed denim jeans which they asked politely but still we founded it rude. The dress code for the bar and dining room was formal dress for man and women which we saw a lot of foreigners nicely following and enjoying their time there .\n4. If u are loud people u will have to really control ur voice there as it’s not considered proper there .\nAt last I would say that we took it as an experience of its own kind and enjoyed our short 2 days stay there ."

As the Club continues to grow in stature, it remains a benchmark of elegance and exclusivity in Indian club life.\nIt was my first time stay and truly enjoyed the quietness, the ambiance and the sprawling gardens. The setting was proper, and the food was delicious, the staff courteous. They retained many of the picture frames and the decor.\nIt’s a perfect getaway for the summer but one must make the booking as early as possible. The rooms are limited and many of the members make their bookings a year ahead.\nWell it’s a place to see and felt, do add it to your bucket list."

The service was just as bad; there was only one waiter who was rude and argued with me. The dining area had flies and even cockroaches, which made the experience very unpleasant.\n- **Room**: While the rooms were decent, they were overshadowed by poor service and cleanliness issues. The towels had a bad smell, adding to the overall discomfort.\n- **Room Service**: Room service was practically non-existent. Every time I needed something, it felt like no one was around to help.\nOverall, this kind of service can seriously hurt the reputation of the business. I wouldn’t recommend Lawley Institute to anyone and suggest looking for better options instead."

On a clear day, you can see rolling green hills, dense forests, and the town of Ooty spread out below like a postcard. The cool mountain air and peaceful atmosphere make it the perfect escape from the hustle and bustle.\n\nThere’s a well-maintained viewpoint and a telescope house where you can get a closer look at the surrounding landscapes. The area is quite clean, with pathways and steps that are easy to walk even for families and older visitors. Small stalls nearby sell hot tea, snacks, and souvenirs, which is great if you want to relax and enjoy the scenery a little longer.\n\nThe drive up to Doddabetta is also beautiful, with winding roads through eucalyptus and shola forests. It’s a fantastic spot for photography, nature walks, or simply unwinding in the fresh mountain air.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone visiting Ooty—make sure this is on your itinerary. The experience of standing on the roof of the Nilgiris is something you won’t forget!"

If you're in Ooty, this viewpoint is an absolute must-visit – literally, it's the highest point in the Nilgiri Hills, and the views are just incredible!\n\nThe drive up to Doddabetta Peak is pretty scenic itself, winding through the lush Ooty landscape. Once you get to the parking area, there's a short walk up to the summit. It's not too strenuous, but the anticipation builds with every step.\n\nAnd then, you reach the top, and BAM! The panoramic views that unfold before you are simply stunning. You get an uninterrupted, 360-degree vista of the Nilgiri hills, stretching out seemingly forever. On a clear day, you can apparently even spot the plains of Coimbatore and the Mysore plateau. When I was there, it was a bit misty, which actually added to the magical, ethereal feel of the place – like floating above the clouds.\n\nThere's a telescope house at the summit, which I found really cool. You can use the powerful telescopes to get a closer look at the distant landscapes, houses, and valleys, which is quite fascinating.\n\nThe air at the peak is incredibly fresh and invigorating, and there's a definite chill, even on a sunny day. It's a great spot to just stand, breathe deeply, and soak in the vastness of nature. There are usually a few vendors selling hot tea and snacks, which is perfect for warming up while enjoying the view.\n\nIt can get a little crowded, especially during peak season, but the sheer scale of the landscape means there's always space to find your own little spot to marvel at the scenery.\n\nVisiting Doddabetta Peak was an awe-inspiring experience. It’s a perfect spot to appreciate the grandeur of the Western Ghats and get a true sense of Ooty’s elevated beauty. If you love expansive views and fresh mountain air, definitely put this on your Ooty itinerary. It’s a moment where you just feel tiny in the best possible way, surrounded by nature’s majesty."

              "reviewText": "Okay, continuing my Ooty adventures, after taking in the views and the charming train ride, a classic Ooty experience I indulged in was Pedal Boating at Ooty Lake. And honestly, it was such a delightful and relaxing way to spend an afternoon!\n\nOoty Lake itself is a pretty prominent feature of the town, and as soon as I got there, I could see all these colorful pedal boats dotting the water. The atmosphere around the lake is quite lively, with vendors and other tourists, but once you're out on the water, it feels surprisingly peaceful.\n\nRenting a pedal boat was straightforward and pretty affordable. My friend and I hopped into one, and it was quite comfortable. The pedal mechanism was easy to use, so even if you're not super athletic, you can still leisurely cruise around the lake without much effort.\n\nBeing out on the water gave me a completely different perspective of Ooty. The surrounding hills, the tall trees, and the small boats all around created a very picturesque scene. We just pedaled gently, chatted, and enjoyed the cool breeze. It was a lovely break from walking and sightseeing, a chance to just sit back (or pedal gently!) and enjoy the natural beauty.\n\nI also saw people having little races, families laughing, and couples enjoying quiet moments – it's an activity that truly suits everyone. You get to feel the freshness of the air, see the reflection of the trees on the water, and just appreciate the simple joy of being outdoors.\n\nOverall, pedal boating at Ooty Lake is a quintessential Ooty experience for a reason. It's fun, relaxing, and offers some great views. If you're in Ooty, definitely take an hour or so to get out on the water. It’s a wonderfully refreshing activity that adds a nice, easygoing charm to your trip!"

You can rent either pedal boats or motor boats at reasonable rates, though the rides are short usually around 20 to 30 minutes. The views from the lake are beautiful, making it a relaxing and refreshing experience.\n\nThere’s also a gaming area for kids (you’ll need to buy a card to play the games), along with small shops selling souvenirs, tea, and snacks. Food stalls are available for quick bites, and clean bathrooms are provided for convenience. Paid parking is available on-site.\n\nSome new activities are under construction, so the experience is likely to get even better in the future. For a perfect day, enjoy boating and then head next door to Mogg Yelay Tea Boutique for tea or coffee with a view of the lake."

              "reviewText": "Ooty Lake is one of the most popular attractions in Ooty, and it definitely lives up to its reputation if you are looking for a scenic and relaxing experience. The lake is spread out beautifully with eucalyptus trees all around, which makes the entire place very picturesque. The highlight here is boating – you can choose from pedal boats, row boats, or motor boats. Pedal boating is fun if you want to take things slow and enjoy the surroundings, while motor boating is faster and gives you a quick ride across the water.\n\nThe entry fee is reasonable, and boating charges vary depending on the type of boat. The place does get very crowded on weekends and holidays, so early mornings or late afternoons are the best times to visit. Apart from boating, there are small stalls serving snacks, tea, and souvenirs. Kids will enjoy the horse rides and toy train nearby.\n\nParking is available but can get tight when it’s crowded. The area is kept relatively clean, but peak-season rush does reduce the charm a little. Still, the cool breeze, fresh air, and mountain backdrop make it a wonderful experience overall. Highly recommended for families, couples, and even solo travelers who want a relaxing outing in Ooty.\nMy tip: Try boating in the evening for the best views and avoid peak hours."

The garden is beautifully maintained and quite expansive, offering a peaceful environment for a stroll. However, since it was not peak blooming season, there were only a few roses in full bloom during our visit.\n\nThe entry fees are Rs. 75 for adults and Rs. 40 for children, with additional charges of Rs. 50 for carrying a camera and Rs. 100 for a video camera, which felt a bit excessive. Paid parking is available across the road but is limited.\n\nOverall, it was a decent experience, worth a visit if you’re in Ooty, especially during peak blooming season."

Entry fee of 75 per adult is a little steep considering due to the weather, the roses are hardly in bloom or appealing.\n\nThe place does have a serene feeling but possibly during the flowering season it would be really worthwhile. The amount of rose species is really amazing.\n\nPossibly a spot to be skipped during the rainy season to invest the time and money in some other travel attraction."

As the light softens and paints the sky in warm hues, the roses seem to glow in a different shade altogether, creating a magical atmosphere. The view of the sun dipping behind the Nilgiri hills adds a dramatic backdrop, making the entire place look even more picturesque and serene. Walking through the garden at that hour feels calming and almost dreamlike, with the cool breeze carrying the subtle fragrance of the flowers.\n\nWhat makes the sunset experience so special here is the peacefulness it brings. The crowds usually thin out a bit by evening, giving you space to soak in the beauty without distraction. Watching the sky change colors while surrounded by thousands of roses is a moment that lingers long after you leave. If you're visiting Ooty, experiencing the Rose Garden at sunset is definitely one of the highlights worth planning for."

Spread across a serene stretch of land, the garden is home to an incredible variety of roses in every shade you can imagine. From classic reds to rare hybrids, it’s a visual treat for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe entry fee is just ₹75 per person, and it’s worth every rupee. We went during the day when the weather was pleasant, which made our stroll through the garden all the more enjoyable. The entire place is very well maintained — clean paths, neatly trimmed hedges, and roses blooming happily in every corner.\n\nWe ended up spending quite some time here — walking, soaking in the colors, and of course, taking tons of pictures. It’s a peaceful escape from the buzz of the city and a must-visit spot if you want to unwind in nature’s lap."

              "reviewText": "recently visited the Government Botanical Garden in Ooty, and it was truly a wonderful experience! Spread across about 22 hectares on the lower slopes of Doddabetta Peak, the garden is beautifully maintained and feels like a peaceful escape into nature.\n\nThe variety of plants is amazing — over 1,000 different species! I especially loved seeing rare trees like the cork tree, paper bark tree, and the fascinating monkey puzzle tree. One of the highlights for me was the 20-million-year-old fossilized tree trunk — it’s incredible to see something that ancient up close.\n\nThe Italian Garden inside the park is also worth mentioning, with its terracotta figurines, fountains, and perfectly trimmed hedges giving it a charming, European feel. I also spent some time exploring the Fern House and Orchid Garden, where they have more than 30 types of ferns and some really rare orchids — simply beautiful!\n\nThe garden is open daily from 7:00 AM to 6:30 PM, and the entry fee is quite reasonable — ₹25 for adults and ₹15 for kids under 10. If you’re carrying a camera, there’s a small extra charge, but it’s totally worth it because there’s so much you’ll want to capture.\n\nIf you can, try to visit during the annual Flower Show in May. I wasn’t there during the show, but I’ve heard it’s absolutely breathtaking with thousands of colorful displays!\n\nOverall, whether you’re a nature lover or just looking for a calm, scenic spot to relax, I highly recommend a visit to the Botanical Garden when you’re in Ooty. It’s definitely one of the highlights of my trip!"

Visiting this Garden was one of the most peaceful and refreshing experiences I’ve had—and I got to enjoy it with my brother and my best friend, which made it even more special.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped in, it felt like we had entered a different world—so green, clean, and beautifully designed. The variety of plants and flowers was mind-blowing, and every corner had something unique to offer. We took so many photos, but honestly, no camera can do justice to how beautiful the place is in real life.\n\nThe garden is perfectly maintained—you can really see the care and hard work that goes into keeping it so neat and inviting. The lawns were trimmed, the flower beds vibrant, and not a single area looked ignored. Even the pathways were peaceful to walk on, and there were so many spots where we just sat, breathed in the fresh air, and took in the view.\n\nThe cool Ooty weather made the entire walk feel like a dream. We laughed, explored, and genuinely felt relaxed—no noise, no stress, just nature at its best. It’s not just a tourist attraction, it’s a place that touches your heart.\n\nA big thank you to the management and staff for maintaining such a gem. This garden is more than just a place to visit—it’s a must-have experience in Ooty. I’ll never forget the time I spent here with my loved ones.\n\n💚 Highly recommended to everyone—whether you're traveling solo, with friends, or family. It’s a memory you’ll carry forever."

Quite a few interesting spots throughout the park.\nConsidering the entry fee of INR 100 per adult, it seems a bit steep for what's on offer. We reached around 2 pm in the afternoon and there was no queue for tickets.\nThe greenhouses, while not that bad, have a lot of scope to be improved as the plant arrangement seemed a bit haphazard.\nIf you are someone who is into gardening and botany, needless to say this is a must visit."

Timber for the roof was hauled here by elephant from Tipu Sultan's Palace in Srirangapatnam (Mysore). Nice stained glass windows and an interesting graveyard at the back, but not that outstanding.\nThis is one of the bigger heritage Church in Ooty with beautiful architecture and the compound beautifully decorated with a garden having wide variety of flowers. Also the beautiful view of the hills in the distance was mesmerizing. It was definitely worth the walk. We enjoyed clicking pictures in the Church compound and had a great time.\nIt has a nice peaceful vibe. If you are interested in places of worship, you could surely visit this church."

The moment I walked in, I was surrounded by lush green plants and the charming architecture that reflects the British colonial era. It really stands out with its old-world charm.\n\nInside the church, it was incredibly quiet—which gave me a nice moment to just relax and slow down. The interior is well-maintained, especially the vintage furniture that’s still in great shape. Just a heads-up: I didn’t notice any toilet facilities available there, so plan accordingly.\n\nGetting there by public transport was simple and added to the experience. I took a bus from Ooty main bus stand. Right near the railway station entrance, there’s a small mini-bus stand. Hop on the one going towards Hill Bunk Junction—the ride is about ₹10 and only takes 5 minutes. Once you get off, the church is a short 500-meter walk. Just follow Google Maps.\n\n✨ Bonus tip for explorers: Instead of the main road, take the small slope path to the left after getting off at Hill Bunk. It’s a more scenic and peaceful walk.\n\nDefinitely worth visiting for history lovers and those looking for a calm spot in the middle of Ooty. 🙏"

I really enjoyed walking through the step-by-step tea manufacturing process—from fresh leaves to powdered tea. It’s not just fun, but also educational—a great place for parents to bring kids and show them how tea is made.\n\n🎟️ Highlights:\n\nYou can clearly see the entire tea production process through glass sections.\n\nEntry ticket is very affordable, and at the end, they offer you a free tea sample to taste.\n\nThere's a pay & use toilet and parking available as well.\n\n🚌 How to Reach (for bus travelers):\nI took a bus from Ooty Bus Stand and boarded a Kotagiri-bound bus. Just ask for a ticket to “Tea Factory” (costs around ₹7). The ride takes about 15 minutes, and the return buses are available frequently—perfect for solo travelers who enjoy using public transport."

The Tea Factory and Museum in Ooty offers a unique and immersive experience into the world of tea – from the history and cultivation to the processing and packaging.\n\n🔍 What to Expect:\n\n🧭 Location & Accessibility:\nNestled amidst the lush Nilgiri hills, the Tea Factory is located on the Doddabetta Road, just a short drive from Ooty town. The road is scenic, but slightly narrow and winding – so drive carefully if you're self-driving. Ample parking is available near the entrance.\n\n🏭 Factory Tour:\nAs you enter, you're guided through a small, functioning tea processing unit where you can watch fresh tea leaves being dried, rolled, and fermented. The process is explained in a simple and engaging manner by friendly staff. You’ll see different grades of tea being produced, including black, green, and white teas.\n\n🎓 Tea Museum:\nRight next to the factory, the museum showcases the rich history of tea – both globally and in India. You’ll find antique tea-making tools, photographs, and fascinating information about British-era plantations in the Nilgiris. It’s educational and well-presented, though a bit small in size.\n\n👃 Tea Tasting:\nOne of the highlights! After the tour, visitors are treated to a complimentary tasting of fresh Nilgiri tea. You can also buy different types of tea, chocolates, and essential oils at the adjoining outlet. Prices are reasonable and the quality is excellent.\n\n🛍️ Souvenir Shop:\nThere’s a well-stocked gift shop where you can buy premium teas (loose and bags), eucalyptus oil, handmade chocolates, and more. It’s tourist-friendly with packaged products ideal for gifting.\n\n🍫 Chocolate Factory (optional):\nSome versions of the tour also include a visit to a small chocolate-making unit nearby, where you can watch handmade chocolates being prepared and even sample some. Kids will love this part!\n\n📸 Viewpoint:\nThe Tea Factory is built at a scenic location, and there’s a small viewing area that offers breathtaking views of the tea estates and Ooty valley. A perfect photo spot!\n\n🕒 Timings & Entry Fee:\n\nOpen all days: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM\n\nEntry Fee: Approx ₹20–₹30 per person\n\nCamera/phone photography allowed, sometimes with a small fee\n\n👍 Pros:\n\nInformative and fun for all ages\n\nLive demonstration of tea-making\n\nClean and well-maintained\n\nFriendly and helpful staff\n\nGreat place to shop for authentic Ooty tea and chocolates\n\n👎 Cons:\n\nGets crowded during weekends and holidays\n\nThe museum section is quite compact\n\nSome parts could use more detailed explanations or interactive displays\n\n🎯 Final Verdict:\nThe Tea Factory and Museum in Ooty is more than just a tourist stop – it’s an educational experience set in a stunning location.

The hotel staff told us that this is a very beautiful and must-visit place and boy they were right.\nIt is beautiful and I would visit it any day over the Botanical Gardens. The place is maintained extremely well. I would go to the extent of comparing it with some of the best gardens in India and even in Asia.\nMy only suggestion is to either keep some guides who have good knowledge of the flora and fauna or keep the recorded version which gives the same details.\nIf you are visiting Ooty this is a MUST GO TO place. Highly recommended."

The entry fee is ₹100 per person, which feels slightly on the higher side.\n\nThe garden is beautifully maintained, with a vast expanse of greenery and a rich variety of flowering plants. It’s clean, well laid out, and offers a relaxing atmosphere for a leisurely walk or quiet picnic. There are benches, picnic spots, a hanging bridge, and public restrooms , though the toilets could use better upkeep.\n\nThe garden also features a fountain and, possibly, a light show, though it wasn’t functional during our visit. As the garden spans varied terrain, comfortable footwear is advisable.\n\nThere is a parking lot in front of the garden gate.\n\nOverall, it’s a peaceful place to unwind and enjoy nature, and we had a pleasant time exploring it."

Snow world is also nice but the jackets and gloves provided are not of good quality. 5D show is just okay.\n\nOverall, visit this place if you have kids and are okay to shell out 650/- per head.

Kudos to the workmanship👏 👏\n\nThey say, it's a 33 yrs old art work. It's the 12yrs of hard n fruitful work by 50 woman. Wherein they have used 6 crore meters of silk embroidery thread to create these plants.\n\nLighting-wise, they could have made a little better arrangement, especially at the end.

The boating itself was enjoyable — we tried the pedal boat and had a relaxing 30-minute ride on the water.\n\nHowever, the lake water was quite dirty, with visible litter and a foul smell in some areas. It took away from the natural beauty and made the experience feel a bit disappointing. The boats themselves were functional, but some looked like they needed maintenance. The surroundings, including the waiting area and restrooms, weren’t very clean either.\n\nIt’s a decent spot for a quick visit, especially if you're already at Ooty Lake, but the authorities really need to improve cleanliness and maintenance to make it more enjoyable for tourists. For now, it’s an okay experience — worth visiting if you’re in Ooty, but don’t set your expectations too high."

Nice place and cool climate you can come here with friend and family also. It is a awesome place for couples. Because they can lot of enjoy here, it is very cool place. It lies in the western ghats so it is good to visit in summer vacations. You can do boating here with some amount of money so it is a nice place must visit here"

With its rich fauna along with varieties of deer such as Sambhar and the Chithal, Deer park makes up for an interesting visit, especially for wildlife enthusiasts. Equally rich is the variety of flora in this park. Spread across an area of 22 acres, this park was established in the year of 1986. It is one of the known wildlife sanctuaries of not only Tamil Nadu but of India presenting amazing opportunity to observe the wildlife and various animals from closer."

While boat house is completely packed with tourists - something as wonderful as an opportunity to see deers in the green goes unnoticed with only a tricle of tourists coming to see it.\n\nWe noted two reasons for this:\n\n1. Unlike other tourist attractions this is not promoted well. You are on your own to discover it from outside and the inside.\n\n2. The park as such does not seem to have even a reception at the entrance to guide where to go. It could be a little walk inside before you see the deers (wondering where the deers are) however we did not see any but again we did not travel much inside when several tourists coming from further down the hill noted they could not see any deers.\n\nThis beautiful location and land could be made great use by the government by promoting it well. However for now there is nothing much for the tourists except for a little natures walk inside and a lovely view of the lake."

Building architecture is excellent and one does not stop looking at it again and again. Construction of such type of building is impossible in modern world. The building was constructed in early part of 19th century possibly in 1823. The museum depicts tribal culture particularly those of the todas. Other artifacts depicting local culture and history are also kept in the museum. Must visit site."

Highlights include Toda artifacts, old photographs, and preserved animal specimens—perfect for anyone curious about Ooty’s roots.\n\nThe museum is kid-friendly, and there’s plenty to see for both adults and children. However, be aware there’s a staircase to the upper floor, so not fully accessible for elderly visitors or those with mobility challenges. There’s a small entry fee, and photography requires an extra ticket. Also, no restroom facilities inside, so please plan ahead.\n\n✅ Cleanliness: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n✅ Exhibit Quality: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n✅ Accessibility: ⭐️⭐️\n✅ Family-Friendliness: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n✅ Overall Experience: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nA charming, quick stop to get a glimpse into Ooty’s history and heritage!"

The carpark was located less than 100m away. I bought my Wax Planet entry ticket at the Main Kiosks which wasn’t crowded and put on my wrist tag before entering the designated area.\n\nThis wasn’t a big museum as compared with Madame Tussauds in Bangkok, Delhi, Hong Kong and Singapore but it did house many life-sized wax figurines which were excellently and distinctly made. Everything smelled new. Figurines were appealing and there were good lightings and props to go with.\n\nHighly appreciated the greetings of the figurine of Mother Theresa here. It was so realistic. Personally, others were generally good like the figurines of Mahatma Ghandi, Obama, Donald Trump, Modi and Putin and actors Bruce Willis and Hugh Jackman. This museum was small scale unlike the one in Delhi which the wax figurines were widely spaced out. So I spent about a good 25-minutes here. There was a horse riding service along the road outside for those who were keen to go for it. Family with kids generally would go for the entire coverage of Thunder World and Wax Planet.\n\nGood to drop by if one is in Ooty."

Initially mentioned it is 200 per head for adults and while paying for same, they said it is not available separately and we have to buy a Thunder World package for 650 per head where all other attractions are useless and just for kids. This is nothing but looting people's money but we saved 400 bucks and they lost 400. They should learn how to do business at least. I wouldn't suggest this."

Some kinds of tea, a box of chocolates, spices and even some Attars (perfumes).\n\nThey also have a tea estate, right on top, which you can visit for a small entry fee.\nSmall nag, we were served different tea than what we asked.

And yet, despite our offering to pay green fees for a friend who had driven us around, the management were adamant that non golfers couldn't walk around. So just played 9 holes and didn't return. Quite a neglected course.. but very picturesque. A colonial mindset perhaps. How do you encourage people to play golf if you shoo them away. We had a few references from friends... but yet paid the full visitors fees as the front desk said they'd have to hear from them directly.. (that's fair enough) but the attitude was not right in my opinion. I've chaired a club for over 6 years and have been on committees for 20 years, am a member in a IGF course...and have attended R&A conventions....with this attitude, golf in Ooty could die out."

I'm sure there's another way to get there by car but we just went from the gardens.\n\nIt's a sacred site with one barrel shaped hut, traditional Toda construction, that remains shut. It sits amidst a cluster of modern houses which is the village of the Todas.\nIt's beautiful to look at given its unusual shape and the material used. If you are lucky, you'll be joined by the priest who lives close by and is more than happy to answer any questions you may have."

Many halts at safe locations in this 4km stretch would be very worthy if you are a passionate photographer.\nBesides this visual treat, the clean breezy air and cool happenings down the valley would definitely calm your mind and soul."

It is located on the main highway between Ooty and Coonoor. You can also enjoy Telescope experience at this view point by paying a little amount of Rs. 10/. Only 15 minutes required to experience. Avoid visit during rainy or fogg days, mainly during December. It s worth watching and plenty of options for photography as well.\n\nThis is an excellent point to stop on way to Conoor. There is a good food joint also maintained by a French Gentleman. Though parking in the view point could be a problem but if weather is fine, you will have a panoramic view..do enough photography there.\n\nStarting from Yellanahalli going up to granduff road way to  Ooty, this view of the Ketti Valley is such a pleasure. Feels like one is looking down from an aircraft when passing though at night with all the lights of the little villages down in the valley.Also the toy train that passes 5 times in a day, with it blowing its whistle as it goes past a curve sounds so like a fairy tale."

The lush green tea plantations stretched across the hills, offering breathtaking views and a calm atmosphere. The fresh aroma of tea leaves in the air made the walk through the estate truly relaxing.\n\nThe guided tour was very informative, explaining the process of tea cultivation and how the leaves are carefully plucked and processed. The highlight was tasting freshly brewed tea – rich in flavor, soothing, and authentic to the region.\n\nThe estate is well-maintained, peaceful, and perfect for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts. It’s not just a visit, but a moment to connect with nature while enjoying the finest tea.\n\nBeautiful scenery\nFresh and aromatic tea\nInformative tour\nGreat spot for relaxation and photography\n\nOverall, Ooty Tea Estate is a must-visit place when in Ooty for its natural beauty and authentic tea experience. 🍵✨"

I took the 7:45 AM train, which is the perfect time to soak in the beauty of the Nilgiris in the crisp morning light. Booking tickets online through IRCTC was a breeze, and at around ₹150, it’s an absolute steal for such an unforgettable experience. Make sure to snag a window seat if you can, it’s a game changer! As the train chugged along, I was mesmerized by the breathtaking views of Ooty’s lush green valleys, rolling hills, and charming little villages nestled in the landscape. The cool, refreshing weather added to the charm, making every moment feel like a scene from a postcard. The slow, rhythmic journey through tunnels and over bridges allowed me to fully appreciate the serene beauty of the region. The train itself, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has a nostalgic charm that enhances the experience. Whether you’re a nature lover, a photography enthusiast, or just looking for a unique adventure, this morning ride is a must-do when visiting Ooty. Trust me, you’ll leave with memories to cherish!"

We were incredibly excited to see the Ooty Toy Train (Train No. 56136), already waiting at the platform. After clicking some pictures, we boarded with our confirmed tickets. Tickets for this toy train are in high demand and are typically booked within seconds, often requiring reservations two months in advance to secure a confirmed seat. The toy train also features a general compartment, for which passengers need to queue up; fares are deducted upon boarding. The train has limited legroom, and it's advisable to avoid large luggage for a more comfortable journey.\n\nThe experience of travelling from Mettupalayam to Udagamandalam (namely known as Ooty) on the toy train was truly amazing. As the train slowly pulled away, we entered a world of dense, green forests. We went over many bridges, some quite high, giving us great views of the valleys below. We also went through several dark tunnels, and each time we came out, a whole new beautiful scene appeared.\n\nAs we climbed higher, the forests gradually changed into vast tea plantations. These looked like green carpets spread across the hillsides. The air became cooler and fresher, and we got panoramic views of the sprawling valleys. Each turn of the track revealed a new postcard-perfect landscape, making the entire journey a feast for the eyes and a truly unforgettable experience."

For such a popular tourist attraction, better management and professionalism at the ticket counters would make the overall experience much smoother."
