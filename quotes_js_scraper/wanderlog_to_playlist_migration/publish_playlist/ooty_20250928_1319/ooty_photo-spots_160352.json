Personally, I liked it better than the one in Botanical gardens.\n\nThere are multiple washrooms available which is great since when we visited in June 2025, there was a nipping chill in the air with intermittent drizzling rain.",

            "text": "recently visited the Government Botanical Garden in Ooty, and it was truly a wonderful experience! Spread across about 22 hectares on the lower slopes of Doddabetta Peak, the garden is beautifully maintained and feels like a peaceful escape into nature.\n\nThe variety of plants is amazing - over 1,000 different species! I especially loved seeing rare trees like the cork tree, paper bark tree, and the fascinating monkey puzzle tree. One of the highlights for me was the 20-million-year-old fossilized tree trunk - it's incredible to see something that ancient up close.\n\nThe Italian Garden inside the park is also worth mentioning, with its terracotta figurines, fountains, and perfectly trimmed hedges giving it a charming, European feel. I also spent some time exploring the Fern House and Orchid Garden, where they have more than 30 types of ferns and some really rare orchids - simply beautiful!\n\nThe garden is open daily from 7:00 AM to 6:30 PM, and the entry fee is quite reasonable - ₹25 for adults and ₹15 for kids under 10. If you're carrying a camera, there's a small extra charge, but it's totally worth it because there's so much you'll want to capture.\n\nIf you can, try to visit during the annual Flower Show in May. I wasn't there during the show, but I've heard it's absolutely breathtaking with thousands of colorful displays!\n\nOverall, whether you're a nature lover or just looking for a calm, scenic spot to relax, I highly recommend a visit to the Botanical Garden when you're in Ooty. It's definitely one of the highlights of my trip!",

Visiting this Garden was one of the most peaceful and refreshing experiences I've had-and I got to enjoy it with my brother and my best friend, which made it even more special.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped in, it felt like we had entered a different world-so green, clean, and beautifully designed. The variety of plants and flowers was mind-blowing, and every corner had something unique to offer. We took so many photos, but honestly, no camera can do justice to how beautiful the place is in real life.\n\nThe garden is perfectly maintained-you can really see the care and hard work that goes into keeping it so neat and inviting. The lawns were trimmed, the flower beds vibrant, and not a single area looked ignored. Even the pathways were peaceful to walk on, and there were so many spots where we just sat, breathed in the fresh air, and took in the view.\n\nThe cool Ooty weather made the entire walk feel like a dream. We laughed, explored, and genuinely felt relaxed-no noise, no stress, just nature at its best. It's not just a tourist attraction, it's a place that touches your heart.\n\nA big thank you to the management and staff for maintaining such a gem. This garden is more than just a place to visit-it's a must-have experience in Ooty. I'll never forget the time I spent here with my loved ones.\n\n💚 Highly recommended to everyone-whether you're traveling solo, with friends, or family. It's a memory you'll carry forever.",

            "text": "We visited the Government Rose Garden during our trip to Ooty in June. The garden is beautifully maintained and quite expansive, offering a peaceful environment for a stroll. However, since it was not peak blooming season, there were only a few roses in full bloom during our visit.\n\nThe entry fees are Rs. 75 for adults and Rs. 40 for children, with additional charges of Rs. 50 for carrying a camera and Rs. 100 for a video camera, which felt a bit excessive. Paid parking is available across the road but is limited.\n\nOverall, it was a decent experience, worth a visit if you're in Ooty, especially during peak blooming season.",

            "text": "Okay, continuing my Ooty adventures, after taking in the views and the charming train ride, a classic Ooty experience I indulged in was Pedal Boating at Ooty Lake. And honestly, it was such a delightful and relaxing way to spend an afternoon!\n\nOoty Lake itself is a pretty prominent feature of the town, and as soon as I got there, I could see all these colorful pedal boats dotting the water. The atmosphere around the lake is quite lively, with vendors and other tourists, but once you're out on the water, it feels surprisingly peaceful.\n\nRenting a pedal boat was straightforward and pretty affordable. My friend and I hopped into one, and it was quite comfortable. The pedal mechanism was easy to use, so even if you're not super athletic, you can still leisurely cruise around the lake without much effort.\n\nBeing out on the water gave me a completely different perspective of Ooty. The surrounding hills, the tall trees, and the small boats all around created a very picturesque scene. We just pedaled gently, chatted, and enjoyed the cool breeze. It was a lovely break from walking and sightseeing, a chance to just sit back (or pedal gently!) and enjoy the natural beauty.\n\nI also saw people having little races, families laughing, and couples enjoying quiet moments – it's an activity that truly suits everyone. You get to feel the freshness of the air, see the reflection of the trees on the water, and just appreciate the simple joy of being outdoors.\n\nOverall, pedal boating at Ooty Lake is a quintessential Ooty experience for a reason. It's fun, relaxing, and offers some great views. If you're in Ooty, definitely take an hour or so to get out on the water. It's a wonderfully refreshing activity that adds a nice, easygoing charm to your trip!",

The carpark was located less than 100m away. I bought my Wax Planet entry ticket at the Main Kiosks which wasn't crowded and put on my wrist tag before entering the designated area.\n\nThis wasn't a big museum as compared with Madame Tussauds in Bangkok, Delhi, Hong Kong and Singapore but it did house many life-sized wax figurines which were excellently and distinctly made. Everything smelled new. Figurines were appealing and there were good lightings and props to go with.\n\nHighly appreciated the greetings of the figurine of Mother Theresa here. It was so realistic. Personally, others were generally good like the figurines of Mahatma Ghandi, Obama, Donald Trump, Modi and Putin and actors Bruce Willis and Hugh Jackman. This museum was small scale unlike the one in Delhi which the wax figurines were widely spaced out. So I spent about a good 25-minutes here. There was a horse riding service along the road outside for those who were keen to go for it. Family with kids generally would go for the entire coverage of Thunder World and Wax Planet.\n\nGood to drop by if one is in Ooty.",

And yet, despite our offering to pay green fees for a friend who had driven us around, the management were adamant that non golfers couldn't walk around. So just played 9 holes and didn't return. Quite a neglected course.. but very picturesque. A colonial mindset perhaps. How do you encourage people to play golf if you shoo them away. We had a few references from friends... but yet paid the full visitors fees as the front desk said they'd have to hear from them directly.. (that's fair enough) but the attitude was not right in my opinion. I've chaired a club for over 6 years and have been on committees for 20 years, am a member in a IGF course...and have attended R&A conventions....with this attitude, golf in Ooty could die out.",

I took the 7:45 AM train, which is the perfect time to soak in the beauty of the Nilgiris in the crisp morning light. Booking tickets online through IRCTC was a breeze, and at around ₹150, it's an absolute steal for such an unforgettable experience. Make sure to snag a window seat if you can, it's a game changer! As the train chugged along, I was mesmerized by the breathtaking views of Ooty's lush green valleys, rolling hills, and charming little villages nestled in the landscape. The cool, refreshing weather added to the charm, making every moment feel like a scene from a postcard. The slow, rhythmic journey through tunnels and over bridges allowed me to fully appreciate the serene beauty of the region. The train itself, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has a nostalgic charm that enhances the experience. Whether you're a nature lover, a photography enthusiast, or just looking for a unique adventure, this morning ride is a must-do when visiting Ooty. Trust me, you'll leave with memories to cherish!",
