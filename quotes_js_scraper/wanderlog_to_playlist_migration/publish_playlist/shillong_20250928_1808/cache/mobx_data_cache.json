Surrounded by manicured gardens, colorful flowers, and shaded walking paths, it’s the kind of place where you instantly slow down. The highlight for me was the charming wooden bridge in the middle—it gives you a picture-perfect view of the lake and the reflections of the trees.\n\nEntry is just ₹20, and you can rent a pedal boat for a relaxed ride on the water. It’s clean, well-maintained, and perfect for families, couples, or even solo travelers looking for a calm stroll. The orchids and seasonal blooms add a splash of color, making it a photographer’s delight.\n\nIn short: peaceful, well-kept, and a refreshing green break from the city’s buzz."

It is located right along the main road, so it’s easy to find. There is an entry ticket, and plastic bottles or any kind of plastic items are not allowed inside, which helps keep the place clean and eco-friendly.\n\nInside the park, there are many trees, a big lake with a lot of fish, and small birds flying around. Visitors often feed the fish, and the overall atmosphere is very calm and close to nature.\n\nThe park is well maintained. Cleaning staff are present and regularly keep the area clean. There is also a small section near a pool where you can rent traditional local dresses and take photos, which is a fun experience. A small café inside the park offers light snacks and drinks, so you can sit and relax for a while.\n\nThis place is good for walking, relaxing, spending time in nature, and clicking photos. I would definitely recommend visiting it if you're in Shillong."

Whether you're a local looking for a serene walk or a traveler exploring Meghalaya, this lake is a must-visit.\n\nHistorical Significance:\nConstructed in 1894, Ward’s Lake was conceptualized by Sir William Erskine Ward (then Chief Commissioner of Assam) and designed by Fitzwilliam Thomas Pollock. It was built under the supervision of Colonel Hopkins. The lake, also referred to as Pollock’s Lake or Nan Polok, reflects Shillong’s colonial-era heritage and continues to be one of the most beloved landmarks of the city.\n\nWhat to Expect:\n\nA beautifully maintained man-made lake surrounded by botanical gardens, seasonal flower beds, and a picturesque wooden bridge.\n\nBoating facilities are available for those looking to enjoy a peaceful ride across the water.\n\nIdeal for leisurely walks, photography, and quiet relaxation.\n\nThe area is rich in flora and frequented by ducks, birds, and fish, making it perfect for nature lovers.\n\nTicketing Details (As per latest on-site information):\n\nAdults: ₹20\n\nChildren (6 to 12 years): ₹10\n\nSenior citizens and persons with disabilities (with ID): ₹10\n\nForeign tourists (children below 12 years): ₹20\n\nMorning Joggers: ₹200/month (Timing: 5:00 AM to 9:00 AM; lake remains closed on Tuesdays for joggers)\n\nStill Camera: ₹0.50\n\nVideo Camera: ₹100 per unit\n\nWedding Shoots: ₹1000 per day\n\nFilm Shooting: ₹3000\n\nDSLR/Digital Camera: ₹20\n\nUPI Payments Accepted\n\nPlastic-free zone: Visitors are encouraged to keep the area clean and plastic-free.\n\nTips for Visitors:\n\nOpen from morning to evening; early mornings are ideal for walks.\n\nAvoid visiting on Tuesday mornings if you're coming for jogging or photography, as the lake remains closed for maintenance.\n\nCarry cash for quick entry, though UPI is now accepted at the counter.\n\nKeep your ticket safe – it must be retained while inside the premises.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nWard’s Lake offers a peaceful and refreshing experience that combines nature, heritage, and local culture.

              "reviewText": "A Must-Visit Landmark in Shillong\n\nThe Cathedral of Mary Help of Christians in Laitumkhrah is one of the most iconic and peaceful places in Shillong. Steeped in history, the Cathedral stands on the site of the first Catholic Church built in 1913 by German missionaries. Though the original structure was destroyed by fire on Good Friday in 1936, the current cathedral—built in the 1940s and consecrated in 1947—carries a strong legacy of resilience, faith, and beauty.\n\nThe architecture is strikingly modern Gothic, built on beds of sand to withstand earthquakes. Inside, the terracotta artwork and stained-glass windows—crafted in Germany and France—beautifully depict the life of Jesus Christ and various Biblical scenes.\n\nDon’t miss the Grotto Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes and the Calvary Hill, where a life-size bronze crucifixion statue and the Stations of the Cross add to the spiritual atmosphere. It’s especially moving during Good Friday when special devotions are held here.\n\nThe Cathedral offers not just a place for prayer, but also a serene escape from the bustle of the city. Whether you're religious or simply appreciate art, history, and quiet reflection, this place is worth visiting.\n\nTip: Visit in the evening for a peaceful ambiance, and take a few moments to read the information board at the entrance—it gives rich context to everything you'll see."

              "reviewText": "Nestled atop the serene Laitumkhrah hill in Shillong, the majestic Cathedral of Mary Help of Christians isn’t just a place of worship – it’s a sanctuary where time pauses, noise fades, and the soul takes a deep, quiet breath. A striking piece of architecture wrapped in calm and character, this cathedral is as much a spiritual experience as it is a historical one.\n\nA Heavenly Blend of Faith and Form\nBuilt in 1936, the cathedral is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, and is the principal church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Shillong. Its design is an elegant mix of Gothic and Indigenous styles, blending high arches, stained glass windows, and local artistry into a structure that feels both majestic and grounded.\n\nWhat sets it apart, quite literally, is its location on a hillock, making it visible from miles away — like a lighthouse of faith. The sky-blue exterior contrasts stunningly with Shillong’s often misty skies, creating a canvas that photographers, poets, and peaceful wanderers would agree is divine inspiration at work.\n\nFun Facts to File Under “Did You Know?”\n- The cathedral was constructed on sand-filled grounds to withstand earthquakes — a wise move in a seismically active region.\n- It houses the grave of Archbishop Hubert D’Rosario, a revered figure who served the region with tireless devotion.\n- During Christmas and Easter, the cathedral is a beacon of celebration, with elaborate nativity displays, lights, and hymns that can warm even the chilliest Shillong night.\n\nReverent Review\nThe cathedral isn’t just a monument, it’s a meditative experience in blue and white. Whether you're religious or simply a lover of quiet architecture, this place offers solace. The chirping of birds, the whiff of incense, and the echo of prayers create a soundtrack that stays with you long after you leave.\n\nPro Tip: Visit on a weekday morning. Less crowd, more calm. And don’t forget to light a candle – sometimes, peace starts with a flicker."

A Soulful & Unforgettable Experience!\n\nEven though I’m a Hindu, I’ve always felt drawn to peaceful, spiritual places  and this church in Shillong truly touched my heart. It's beautifully built across a large area and has two levels  both the upper and lower sections are stunning and calm.\n\nThe entire church is so picturesque that I couldn’t stop taking photos. Every corner was beautiful and serene. But beyond the beauty, what made this visit unforgettable was a very special moment.\n\nI wanted to light candles as a prayer, but unfortunately, there was no shop nearby. I was a little disappointed. Just then, a local person saw me and kindly offered me a candle. When I tried to pay, he smiled and said,\n\"You’ve come to God’s house  it’s free. Please take it.\"\nThat moment was so pure and touching. I’ll never forget his kindness  it made my entire trip feel truly blessed.\n\nThis place is not just a church; it’s an experience of peace, humility, and connection  beyond religion. Whether you're spiritual or not, this is a place you must visit in Shillong.\n\nHighly recommended  truly a must-visit! 🙏✨"

Beyond its religious significance, this place offers a holistic experience, embracing education, literature, and community engagement.\n\nThe mosque hosts a school committed to providing high-quality education, shaping young minds with a focus on excellence. Adjacent to this educational institution is a sprawling library, housing an extensive collection of books on Islam. What sets this library apart is its inclusivity, featuring materials in a multitude of languages, thereby becoming a beacon of knowledge accessible to a diverse audience.\n\nThe architecture extends beyond the prayer halls, with a meticulously designed sitting area that beckons visitors to immerse themselves in the world of literature. The intention behind its layout is evident—a space that not only accommodates reading but encourages it, fostering an atmosphere of reflection and tranquility.\n\nParticularly noteworthy are the Islamic classes held in the library on specific days. This community-oriented initiative further establishes the mosque as a center for both spiritual and intellectual growth. It opens its doors not only to the Muslim community but also extends a warm welcome to individuals of all backgrounds, making it a cultural and educational hub for Shillong.\n\nIn essence, this mosque transcends religious boundaries, emerging as a cultural landmark and educational haven. Its architectural magnificence, coupled with a commitment to knowledge and community, renders it a must-visit destination—even for those outside the Muslim faith."

The drive through the hills was beautiful — green, breezy, and calming, setting the perfect tone before even reaching the falls.\n\nGoogle Maps was accurate and guided us right to the location without any confusion, which was a huge help on those hilly roads.\n\nOnce there, you’ll need to climb down a set of stairs to witness the three levels of the waterfall — each with its own charm. The view is breathtaking and the sound of rushing water surrounded by greenery is incredibly refreshing.\n\nThere’s a small café at the entrance, perfect for grabbing a bite or a hot coffee. We got caught in the rain and were completely drenched — that hot cup of coffee afterward felt amazing!\n\nThere’s also a market inside the premises where you can buy souvenirs or local handmade items — a great stop if you’re looking to take a little memory back home.\n\nThe entry fee is ₹100 per person, and the area is fairly well-maintained.\n\nIf you’re in Shillong, Elephant Falls is a must-visit — for the views, the peaceful vibe, and the complete nature experience."

Just a short drive from Shillong’s hustle - around 15 km from Police Bazar - this place opens up into a vast, glimmering expanse of water cradled by rolling green hills. It’s the kind of place that makes you pause, breathe, and forget time altogether.\n\nThe surroundings are peaceful and beautifully kept - perfect for an afternoon stroll or simply sitting by the shore with a flask of tea. Boating here is a real treat - hop onto a shared speedboat or take a kayak out if you fancy a bit more quiet. Either way, the views are sublime, especially as the sun starts to dip and the sky reflects off the lake’s calm surface.\n\nBefore reaching the lake entrance, there’s a lovely little viewpoint worth stopping for. You’ll find some fast food stalls there too - nothing fancy, but great for a quick bite with a view.\n\nWhether you’re into photography, nature, or just a bit of soul-soothing stillness, Umiam Lake is a must. A gentle reminder of how spectacular simplicity can be."

The moment you step out, you’re greeted with an incredible 180-degree view of calm blue waters surrounded by rolling green hills. I went around late afternoon, and the golden light made the whole place look magical.\n\nThe entry fee was just ₹50, and there are benches to sit and simply soak in the scenery. It’s a great place for photography—whether you’re after sweeping landscapes or peaceful close-ups of the lake. If you have extra time, you can try boating or just stroll in the nearby garden.\n\nIn short: serene, scenic, and worth stopping even if you’re only passing by. Perfect for a relaxing pause before diving back into Meghalaya’s adventures."

It’ll help you in making memories\nWe took many pictures and had really fun at the view point as well.\nSpare at-least 2-3 hrs\nIt’s air conditioned and well maintained, The staff is friendly too and there’s a store with lot of options to buy from."

It takes 1-2 hrs to see all details.\nEvery floor has clean toilets. Whole premises is neat and clean.\nTickets for Adults Rs.100, Children Rs.50, Camera Rs.100. (they allow only camera pass holder to take photos, no other devices allowed)\nIt can get crowded during peak hours too. Overall, a good experience, but with a few improvements, it could be even better."

The museum beautifully showcases the rich cultural heritage of the Seven Sister states and the one brother — Sikkim. Each floor is dedicated to different aspects of tribal life, art, history, and traditions of Northeast India, including Gangtok.\n\nThe displays are well-organized, informative, and visually appealing. There's also a small café near the ticket counter where you can get coffee and sandwiches at very reasonable prices — a nice touch after exploring the museum.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone interested in learning about the diverse cultures of Northeast India."

After getting the ticket, a staff member took me inside.\n\nOnce inside, they provided an ID card, and I had to pay separately to take photos and videos.\n\nThey informed me that there are seven floors, and there was also a small guide booklet available. The booklet explained everything—what’s on each floor and where to find it.\n\nEach even-numbered floor had a restroom, accessible to everyone—including both men and women.\n\nI was exploring the place alone—there was no guide, and not many people around either. But I really enjoyed it. The place was very well-maintained and quite impressive.\n\nWhat I liked the most was the lighting system. They had motion detectors—so whenever I entered a room, the lights would automatically turn on, and once I left, they would turn off.\n\nAt the very top, on the terrace, you could actually see the entire view of the surroundings—it’s the highest point. The view from there was absolutely amazing. It was truly the best moment for me.\n\nI visited around sunset, and that golden, peaceful moment felt truly special to me—it was absolutely beautiful.\n\nAfter exploring everything, it was almost closing time. There were also a few things available for purchase near the main entrance.\n\nI would definitely recommend this as a must-visit place, especially for the stunning top view and sunset experience. It was truly worth it!"

              "reviewText": "I visited the Don Bosco Museum yesterday, and it’s hands down the biggest museum I’ve ever explored! With multiple floors filled with exhibits, it offers a deep dive into the rich culture, history, and traditions of Northeast India — truly impressive and educational.\n\nThe entry ticket is ₹100 per person, and if you want to take photos, there’s an additional ₹100 photo pass (no videos allowed). Be careful — if you’re caught clicking pictures without the pass, there’s a fine. So better to get it beforehand.\n\nThe Skywalk on the top floor is a major highlight! It gives you a breathtaking 360° view of Shillong city, and it was honestly one of the most memorable parts of the visit.\n\nI also really enjoyed the space and science section, which was interactive and fun. There’s no guide, but everything is well-labelled and easy to follow at your own pace.\n\nReaching the place is easy with Google Maps, though the final turn can be a bit confusing due to narrow alleys that show as roads on the map — but just follow it patiently and you’ll get there.\n\nThere’s free parking available with enough space for both two-wheelers and four-wheelers, which is a big plus.\n\nIf you’re in Shillong, I highly recommend adding Don Bosco Museum to your itinerary — it’s informative, fun, and gives you a true appreciation of the region’s diversity."

You will first be greeted by the traditional wear of all the different North-Eastern communities as you enter the building, including well-researched sections on the neighbouring countries like Bhutan, Myanmar, and Nepal. The photography section is loaded with rare photos – you can spend hours lost exploring these snippets of tribal life taken across the region and spanning many generations.\nDon't forget to go on the terrace for the amazing and wonderful view of the City ❤️."

U may click pics inside the museum only due to security reasons. Cash, card, UPI any mode of payment u may use for ticket. For kids, fighter jet joystick game is also available inside the museum at Rs.50. My kids enjoyed it. All north east states glimpse also there  small shop for buying things also there but prices are higher than outside. Many aircraft also there for watching. A small garden also there. There one canteen also u may enjoy food at cheaper rate. They accept cash and UPI mode only. If you are going to eat non veg, first count the pieces before eating. Bcs they said us 8 pieces of motton in the dish we will get  but we had 5 only. After asking them about this issue, they said they served us 8 pieces. And they can not do anything. In one word, they cheated us."

              "reviewText": "A must-visit destination for aviation and military enthusiasts! Located near Elephant Falls in Upper Shillong, this museum offers a unique glimpse into the glorious history of the Indian Air Force.\n\nThe outdoor display is impressive — featuring real aircraft like the MiG-21, Mi-4 helicopter, Hunter fighter, and Caribou transport plane. Inside, the galleries are well-maintained, showcasing war medals, uniforms, aircraft models, missiles, and even a working flight simulator. One section also highlights the rich culture of Northeast India, which adds a unique regional touch.\n\nThe museum is clean, organized, and has decent facilities like restrooms, parking, and a small souvenir shop. Entry is very affordable (₹30 for adults), but carry a valid Indian photo ID as it's mandatory for entry. Foreign nationals are not allowed due to security reasons.\n\nPhotography is allowed in most outdoor areas, and you can easily spend 1–2 hours exploring everything. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Shillong!\n\n✅ Best Time to Visit: Wednesday to Sunday (closed on Mondays & Tuesdays)\n✅ Don't miss the aircraft cockpit you can sit in!"

              "reviewText": "Tucked away in the quiet hills of Shillong’s Upper Mawprem area, the Indian Air Force Museum is the kind of place where Top Gun meets East Khasi Hills. It’s not just for aviation buffs or war-history enthusiasts — it’s a full-throttle, high-altitude experience even for those who don’t know a MiG from a Maggi!\n\nWhen History Takes Flight\nMaintained by the Eastern Air Command of the Indian Air Force, this museum is an ode to courage, engineering marvels, and that inexplicable human urge to defy gravity. The moment you step in, you’re greeted by a real fighter jet standing guard outside, which is the closest you can get to touching supersonic history without triggering a security breach.\n\nInside? It's a buffet of:\n- Fighter aircraft models, including Sukhoi and MiG variants (no, not the ones from your toy box).\n- Ammunition and uniforms worn during different wars, including the 1965 and 1971 Indo-Pak conflicts.\n- An impressive war-time photo gallery that could give National Geographic a run for its money.\n- Oh, and an actual ejector seat. Yes, the kind you’d want to use in Monday morning meetings!\n\nDid You Know?\n- The museum showcases pieces of enemy aircraft shot down during wartime — talk about souvenirs with attitude and swag.\n- There’s a replica of a remotely piloted vehicle (RPV) that once did spy duty — proof that drones had ancestors too.\n- This is one of the few Air Force museums in India open to civilians, and probably the only one where you can hear birds chirp outside as jets silently roar from within.\n\nRadar Review\nThe museum is neat, compact, and surprisingly insightful. Kids will love it, adults will get misty-eyed, and every Indian heart will swell just a bit with pride. The only thing missing is popcorn — because this place deserves a background score!\n\nPro Tip: Entry is free, but carry an ID. And no touching the missiles — they don’t take kindly to unsolicited hugs."

Divided into two delightful sections, Animal Land and Kids Park, it offers a serene environment perfect for relaxation and family fun.\n\nWhile Animal Land is currently closed due to an exciting government initiative to transfer the animals to the state zoo, this space is being thoughtfully redesigned to include additional public facilities and a convenient parking lot. Despite this transition, the park's charm remains undiminished, offering an inviting atmosphere for visitors of all ages.\n\nThe Kids Park is a paradise for children, featuring a variety of engaging activities such as swings, seesaws, and merry-go-rounds. It is a haven of laughter and joy, where little ones can play freely and safely. The weekends, particularly Saturday and Sunday, see the park buzzing with families enjoying their leisure time, taking advantage of the pleasant surroundings.\n\nEntry to this delightful oasis is incredibly affordable, with tickets priced at just 20 for adults. This nominal fee ensures access to a well-maintained and welcoming space that provides immense value for visitors.\n\nAdding to the park’s appeal is the vibrant street food scene just outside its gates. Here, visitors can indulge in a variety of delicious snacks, making for a perfect end to a day of play and relaxation. Additionally, the availability of free street parking makes visiting the park convenient and stress-free.\n\nOverall, this park is a beautiful, serene retreat where nature and joy converge, offering a perfect escape from everyday life."

There was almost no crowd—just one lady at the entrance giving tickets . Since no one else was around, I explored the entire museum alone, which made it even more peaceful and personal.\n\nThe place isn't very big, but it's very well-maintained and thoughtfully arranged. You get to see a lot about the local lifestyle—traditional clothing, dressing sense, musical instruments, coins, flowers, and even geographical maps. It’s a wonderful glimpse into the culture and heritage of the region.\n\nIf you're in Shillong and interested in local history and culture, this museum is definitely worth a visit. It may be small, but it offers a rich and quiet experience."

              "reviewText": "A Must-Visit Landmark in Shillong\n\nThe Cathedral of Mary Help of Christians in Laitumkhrah is one of the most iconic and peaceful places in Shillong. Steeped in history, the Cathedral stands on the site of the first Catholic Church built in 1913 by German missionaries. Though the original structure was destroyed by fire on Good Friday in 1936, the current cathedral—built in the 1940s and consecrated in 1947—carries a strong legacy of resilience, faith, and beauty.\n\nThe architecture is strikingly modern Gothic, built on beds of sand to withstand earthquakes. Inside, the terracotta artwork and stained-glass windows—crafted in Germany and France—beautifully depict the life of Jesus Christ and various Biblical scenes.\n\nDon’t miss the Grotto Chapel of Our Lady of Lourdes and the Calvary Hill, where a life-size bronze crucifixion statue and the Stations of the Cross add to the spiritual atmosphere. It’s especially moving during Good Friday when special devotions are held here.\n\nThe Cathedral offers not just a place for prayer, but also a serene escape from the bustle of the city. Whether you're religious or simply appreciate art, history, and quiet reflection, this place is worth visiting.\n\nTip: Visit in the evening for a peaceful ambiance, and take a few moments to read the information board at the entrance—it gives rich context to everything you'll see."

              "reviewText": "Nestled atop the serene Laitumkhrah hill in Shillong, the majestic Cathedral of Mary Help of Christians isn’t just a place of worship – it’s a sanctuary where time pauses, noise fades, and the soul takes a deep, quiet breath. A striking piece of architecture wrapped in calm and character, this cathedral is as much a spiritual experience as it is a historical one.\n\nA Heavenly Blend of Faith and Form\nBuilt in 1936, the cathedral is dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, and is the principal church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Shillong. Its design is an elegant mix of Gothic and Indigenous styles, blending high arches, stained glass windows, and local artistry into a structure that feels both majestic and grounded.\n\nWhat sets it apart, quite literally, is its location on a hillock, making it visible from miles away — like a lighthouse of faith. The sky-blue exterior contrasts stunningly with Shillong’s often misty skies, creating a canvas that photographers, poets, and peaceful wanderers would agree is divine inspiration at work.\n\nFun Facts to File Under “Did You Know?”\n- The cathedral was constructed on sand-filled grounds to withstand earthquakes — a wise move in a seismically active region.\n- It houses the grave of Archbishop Hubert D’Rosario, a revered figure who served the region with tireless devotion.\n- During Christmas and Easter, the cathedral is a beacon of celebration, with elaborate nativity displays, lights, and hymns that can warm even the chilliest Shillong night.\n\nReverent Review\nThe cathedral isn’t just a monument, it’s a meditative experience in blue and white. Whether you're religious or simply a lover of quiet architecture, this place offers solace. The chirping of birds, the whiff of incense, and the echo of prayers create a soundtrack that stays with you long after you leave.\n\nPro Tip: Visit on a weekday morning. Less crowd, more calm. And don’t forget to light a candle – sometimes, peace starts with a flicker."

A Soulful & Unforgettable Experience!\n\nEven though I’m a Hindu, I’ve always felt drawn to peaceful, spiritual places  and this church in Shillong truly touched my heart. It's beautifully built across a large area and has two levels  both the upper and lower sections are stunning and calm.\n\nThe entire church is so picturesque that I couldn’t stop taking photos. Every corner was beautiful and serene. But beyond the beauty, what made this visit unforgettable was a very special moment.\n\nI wanted to light candles as a prayer, but unfortunately, there was no shop nearby. I was a little disappointed. Just then, a local person saw me and kindly offered me a candle. When I tried to pay, he smiled and said,\n\"You’ve come to God’s house  it’s free. Please take it.\"\nThat moment was so pure and touching. I’ll never forget his kindness  it made my entire trip feel truly blessed.\n\nThis place is not just a church; it’s an experience of peace, humility, and connection  beyond religion. Whether you're spiritual or not, this is a place you must visit in Shillong.\n\nHighly recommended  truly a must-visit! 🙏✨"

I couldn't reach the waterfall, neither attempted to because of the polluted end of the stream where I started.\n\nBut the catch here is that, if you follow the trek uphill like I did, you will enjoy a very pleasing view of the pine trees.Location: East Khasi Hills District, Shillong\n\nLocated within the Shillong Cantonment, on the outskirts of the city, lies a sparkling waterfall which looks like an eagle with wings spread. Hence the name Spread Eagle Falls. The falls is locally known as Umkaliar or the falls into which Ka Liar slipped. A soothing setting amidst the calmness of nature - a treat to the eyes.No any road is found for the wonderful place communicating is very bad for the place visitors waste time for searching the place no security and name place is availabe for the wonderful place for which visitors avoid this place8 KM distance from Shillong Town, opposite eastern air command HQ; best to visit in the month May,June,July,August,September,& October.It's pleasant environment best for family picnic.Local people here are very respectable and very welcome to all who visit here.It's also called the sweet falls.. its kinda not so famous like other places in Shillong but the view is worth it. Especially if u go early in the morning wid no one around.A must visit for any tourist travelling in the north eastern states of India. It's in Meghalaya, and what a better way to start/end your journey other than taking a picture with the beautiful waterfall in the background.A place where you can fell the majestic nature of North Eastern India. It is a beutiful and tall water fall, a place to go with your friends and family. But elder persons will face problem for going up and down by narrow stairs to see best part of the water fall. If my advice really helps you, please give it a thums up 👍🏻"

You can also get parking for two wheelers easily at a nearby free place. The museum houses guns replicas of old days along with statues with high ranked officials. It has a lot of photographs along with information. If you read it all, it will easily take the day. I spent the evening there, we have to mark entry at the entrance.

The exhibits give a strong sense of the region’s past, including its military connections, and I found it engaging without feeling overwhelming.\n\nThe building itself has a certain old-world charm, and being inside the cantonment area makes the visit feel a little special. While the collection isn’t massive, it’s thoughtfully put together, and the stories behind the displays left an impression on me.\n\nFor anyone interested in culture and history, it’s definitely worth a stop. Short, simple, but memorable—I really enjoyed the visit."

Overall, I'd say this museum is a great place to learn about history and see some interesting exhibits.\n\n*Duration:* I'd recommend allocating about 30 minutes for your visit. ⏰ It's the perfect amount of time to take in all the exhibits and get a feel for the museum.\n\n*Overall:* If you're in Shillong and looking for a quick, interesting stop, this museum is definitely worth checking out! 👍"

Only those interested in military history will enjoy it. I spent 1.5 hours there , but I was the only one inside it. Since, I am a military history buff, I quite enjoyed learning the history of the Assam Rifles, the Assam Regiment, the local 101 Area, and the contributions of various units during the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. It has very few artifacts (less than 10). Photography is not allowed inside the museum. There is no entry fee and no checks either."

Every artifact seems to whisper secrets of the past, making it a paradise for those who cherish history and nature.\n\nWhat makes this place truly special, however, is the soul behind it—the owner, a remarkably humble and down-to-earth man with an astonishing depth of knowledge about virtually everything. His passion is contagious, and his dedication to preserving and sharing knowledge is truly inspiring. The entire team at the museum is just as warm and welcoming, making every visitor feel at home.\n\nThe peaceful and calming environment adds to the museum’s charm, making it not just a place of learning but also a retreat for the soul. I sincerely hope that this museum gains the recognition it truly deserves and continues to flourish, touching more lives with its beauty and wisdom."

The owner will check your photo album to see how many photos you have taken. This is not the way to publicise your museum and i disliked this practice. It should have been a single photography fee.

The area is still developing as a tourist spots so its a bit dusty in the view point area. The waterfalls is quite a climb down a hill that too without any steps or proper road, so not recommended for old people. But I hope it will be more developed in years to come and at least a pathway will be constructed to go near the waterfalls."

You'll need to park at the ticket counter and then take a short taxi ride through an Indian Air Force area, which adds a unique touch. The drive, though only 3 kilometers, is a peaceful and scenic ascent, maintained at a gentle 30 km/h. Keep in mind that this tranquil spot closes relatively early, around 4 PM, so plan your visit accordingly. The serene atmosphere and stunning vistas make it an unforgettable destination."

The view itself is absolutely breathtaking—you get a sweeping panorama of the city, the hills, and on a clear day it feels magical, almost like floating above the clouds. That part really lived up to the hype and made the visit memorable.\n\nWhat disappointed me, though, was how commercialized the whole place felt. Instead of focusing on showcasing culture or giving visitors a deeper experience of the region, everything seemed centered around selling things—photo ops in traditional Khasi attire, snacks, and trinkets. The charm of the natural setting gets a bit overshadowed by the push for money.\n\nDespite that, I can’t deny the beauty of the viewpoint itself. The scenery makes it worth a visit, but the experience could have been so much richer if it celebrated the culture as much as the view. For me, it’s a solid 4/5."

Beyond its religious significance, this place offers a holistic experience, embracing education, literature, and community engagement.\n\nThe mosque hosts a school committed to providing high-quality education, shaping young minds with a focus on excellence. Adjacent to this educational institution is a sprawling library, housing an extensive collection of books on Islam. What sets this library apart is its inclusivity, featuring materials in a multitude of languages, thereby becoming a beacon of knowledge accessible to a diverse audience.\n\nThe architecture extends beyond the prayer halls, with a meticulously designed sitting area that beckons visitors to immerse themselves in the world of literature. The intention behind its layout is evident—a space that not only accommodates reading but encourages it, fostering an atmosphere of reflection and tranquility.\n\nParticularly noteworthy are the Islamic classes held in the library on specific days. This community-oriented initiative further establishes the mosque as a center for both spiritual and intellectual growth. It opens its doors not only to the Muslim community but also extends a warm welcome to individuals of all backgrounds, making it a cultural and educational hub for Shillong.\n\nIn essence, this mosque transcends religious boundaries, emerging as a cultural landmark and educational haven. Its architectural magnificence, coupled with a commitment to knowledge and community, renders it a must-visit destination—even for those outside the Muslim faith."

Hence, the name Khola Mahadev. The cave opening inside the temple is said to lead directly to Kamakhya temple in Guwahati. A local shared that a sadhu and another man has attempted that journey."

The temple is dedicated to Lord Mahadev and is said to be more than 150 years old. It is situated about 4 Kms from Shillong city and can be reached by taxis, city buses and private cars. The devotees need to walk about 300 meters from the main Gate of the temple as the path is not meant for four wheelers. The temple is situated in the midst of hills in a beautiful, picturesque location. The small stream flowing around the temple adds to its beauty. There are other temples  dedicated to Hindu Gods in the premises. Maha Shivaratri is celebrated with great fervour and a large number of devotees visit this temple. The wheelchair is inaccessible due to the steep slope on the way to the temple. There is no specified parking place for the devotees, while entry to the temple is free. Puja items are available in the shops near the temple. Drinkable water is available in the premises of the temple. Overall, a must visit place for all."

It is one of the oldest temples in Meghalaya and among the famous places of pilgrimage in Shillong.\n\nBelieved to be about 150 years old, the Mahadev Khola Dham is a cave temple dedicated to Lord Shiva. According to legend, the temple is built at the spot where Lakhiya Baba, a sage was decided to stay and meditate. A subedar-major of 8th Gorkha Regiment dreamt of the sage mediating with a trishul (trident) in his hand and a rudraksh' necklace around his neck. The very next day, the man searched for the sage and found him at the place where the mandir' stands today. During the course of excavation for construction of the temple, the subedar-major found a huge shivling and thus the temple dedicated to Lord Shiva.\n\nThe present temple was built by several persons after independence, but the earlier one was built with the permission of the then British government. There is a small opening in the cave that leads to another cave. A small statue of Lord Shiva guards the entrance. It is believed that the opening leads to the ancient Kamakhya temple atop the Nilachal Hills in Kamrup, Assam directly. Apart from the main temple, there are many small temples in the complex, which are believed to have been built by devotees of Mahadev Khola Dham.\n\nA grand mela of Lord Shiva is held for three days every year on the occasion of Maha Shivaratri at this temple. During the mela, more than 25,000 people visit the temple for the lord's blessings.\nCourtesy:trawell.in"

Nice and peaceful with clean water  and a variety of different plants.\n\nLots of flowers and a few animals like ducks as well. There's a coffee shop inside as well with a beautiful view.\n\nIs in essence a small park within the city and you can spend about 30 minutes here. Nothing of any historic value here just sight seeing.\n\nDon't forget to like the review if you found it helpful"

Cool experience, amazing views, and a spiritual vibe - what's not to love? 😊\n\ndon't forget your camera and binoculars to capture the stunning views! 📸\""

Still we (group of 3, including female friend) visited this is place on our own and found a very good view of the falls. Later a group of wicked boys of age group 12-15 arrived there, and started staring at us weirdly, puffing cigarettes (could be weed as well) simultaneously. Later we remembered the warning given by the cab driver and took extra caution about are belongings. Without giving any chance for a conversation we left that place.\n\nVisit this place in normal day time with the sufficiently big group and take extra care about your valuables."

It was colourful and flavour full. Can recommend it anytime.\nAtmosphere is almost like museum with traditional craft and musical instruments on display. U can also play the musical instruments if u wish. They arrange live music as well i guess during dinner hours."

As we placed the ordered we were offered a shot of Roselle tea as a complimentary from the cafe. When the food came, it was a blessing for the two hungry travellers. Turmeric rice, smoked beef, smoked pork alongside the fermented fish chutney, and green salad perfectly balanced the meal. One thing is certain, the cafe is making traditional meals of food recipes into a trend among the young generations.\n\nA must visit!"

I recently had the pleasure of dining there and was completely captivated by the experience. The cafe's unique, motor-themed ambiance, which celebrates the region's love for bikes and cars, is both quirky and inviting. With a Royal Enfield motorcycle hanging from the ceiling and clever use of vehicle parts for decor, the atmosphere is unlike any other.\n\nThe real star of the show, however, is the food. I ordered the Bombay sandwich, the chef's special Maggi, and the noodles, and each dish was bursting with flavor and made to perfection. The menu offers a delightful mix of hearty Italian and Chinese dishes, local favorites, and creative street-food-inspired options. The presentation was beautiful, and the taste was even better—true comfort food that warms the soul.\n\nBeyond the amazing food and cool decor, the cafe's location itself is a treat, offering stunning views of the surrounding natural beauty. The staff is attentive and the service is terrific, making you feel relaxed and welcomed. It's the perfect spot to unwind after a visit to the nearby Elephant Falls or to simply enjoy a cozy evening with friends. ML 05 Cafe is more than just a place to eat; it’s a destination that captures the heart with its serene vibe and delicious offerings."

They actually have a Royal Enfield hung right inside the café. The overall set up is about travel, number plates and North East. Food here is good but not so great to be honest. They do have various options to choose from, but the taste for most of the items are okayish. The portion sizes in English breakfast platter are ridiculously small and mostly it’ll not be sufficient if you’re a foodie. The sitting arrangements are cozy and provides you the privacy you want. The washroom is clean and decent in size. The staffs here don’t have a heartwarming polite behaviour but it suffices your needs. The road leading to this establishment might be little confusing due to the ongoing highway work. Just for the record, the entry to this café is directly from the highway through a pine forest. It’s not as shown in Google Maps (through Krishi Vigyan Kendra). Please be very careful on this aspect otherwise you’ve to walk a LOT.\nOverall, a decent food joint to spend some good cozy times with your family, friends or partner."

Located just next to a pine forest, the outdoor scenery was equally as nice as the inside atmosphere. It is undoubtedly the ideal getaway for both bikers and travellers because to its specially designed sports, bike, and travel-themed décor. The rich tradition of hospitality reflects in the welcoming atmosphere of their café. They feature a mix of seating options. We placed the order for Pizza, Chicken Momo, Maggie sandwich, Tea and Brownie with ice cream. I never had a Maggie sandwich before, but I absolutely loved it. The food we ordered was delicious, beautifully presented, and the wait time was not very long. We would love to come here again.\nWe appreciate Hepz (Hep Drive Go, Meghalaya) for recommending this place."

It was damn nice, totally worth trying.\nTheir naga chilli cheese toast is worth the hype. Its too good.\nTheir farmhouse pizza however disappointed us. It was not cooked properly. But the staff was really good. They immediately replaced it with nachos which were also really nice.\nWe also got to witness some live music. All in all we had a good time"

The soft music in the background added to the pleasant, laid-back vibe.\n\nLocated on the first floor, the café offers both indoor and outdoor seating, with separate zones for smoking and non-smoking guests. The service staff was exceptionally warm and welcoming — their friendly demeanour and helpful recommendations added to the charm of the place.\n\nOrdered Crunchy chicken burger, Naga Chili pork with Shillong noodles. The food was sumptuous and portions were very good.  The chili pork was a standout — tender, flavour-packed, and perfectly spiced. Shillong noodles had a fresh, peppery punch and tender chicken chunks, it was truly the chef’s delight.\n\nAdequate parking within the café premises and well-maintained washrooms also enhanced the overall experience.\n\nThe place was a bit pricey, but felt the quality of the food quality, ambience, and experience made it worth every penny. Would definitely recommend Dylan’s café for a relaxed, romantic casual outing and enjoy the signature dish - Naga Chili pork with Shillong noodles."

The location is right on the  main road  but  being Shillong there's hardly any  traffic  noise. Parking can be an issue if you are self driving. The menu is quite  exhaustive.  The  food quality is okay. Ambience of the place is very nice.  Staff and service is very good.  You can  certainly try it once."

The rice noodles well complemented making it a well seasoned dish. The peach 🍑 smoothie was mentioned on the recommended drinks of the night. It justified it being the drink of the night.\n\nService - 4.0/5\nThe server was zoned and clueless. I suspect him being drunk. But the lady in the reception held on her own but she looked visually frustrated with the server.\n\nAmbience (instead of location)- 4.5/5\nVery nice laid back music-sports themed cafe in the heart of Laitumkhrah. The tables were clean and restaurant had no foul odour. Even the washrooms seemed really clean. I would personally visit again.\n\nOverall verdict - 4.5/5\nVery good food prepared by the chef. The bill management system was efficiently managed by the staff. Please ensure the servers you have are proactive and work with a smile. Else I give a thumbs 👍 up to the place"

Prices are a little high for college students (hence I never visited when I was a student of SEC), but went there recently as an adult…cool place to sip a cup of coffee & look at the world pass by. Perfect view. On the day we visited, there was a power cut in the building so the menu options were limited especially in terms of beverage but on the whole, it was a nice & aesthetic dining experience!"

However, I was somewhat disappointed by its size, especially considering the 420-rupee price tag—I had expected a bit more. Nevertheless, the taste didn't disappoint. To compensate, we ordered the beef spaghetti meatballs, which turned out to be quite good. Overall, the food leans towards the pricey side, and while the taste is satisfactory, it doesn't reach extraordinary heights. On the positive side, the ambiance adds to the overall experience."

It’s a lively local market with a great selection of affordable winter wear — coats, shoes, shirts, and more. I also found a wide variety of keychains, which I really loved. There are spacious roadside eateries nearby as well, and the food was absolutely delicious — definitely a must-try! You’ll also find many varieties of chillies there, which are really spicy and unique. If you're visiting Meghalaya, make sure not to leave without experiencing Police Bazar.One of the best parts was the lighting at night — it looked so beautiful! Although the market closes a bit early, the overall vibe in the evening is amazing. Totally worth visiting!"

There is so much to do in the market, do try the momos specifically the veg ones. One can get clothes, souvenirs and many other items at a very reasonable price. There are few cafes in the market as well. The market closes at 10 PM 🕙 so visit accordingly 🤟🏻"

Although I don't think the waterfall is accessible (correct me if I'm wrong) so that might seem a bit disappointing. Also there's no shop nearby(atleast 500m+). In summary, it's a nice place for a small hangout, the air is fresh and crispy which set the perfect atmosphere to crack open a couple of cold ones.\nIf you're a tourist, I recommend renting scooty while going for this spot. That way you can also move ahead of schedule and visit more places."
