The moment you step through the gates and catch your first glimpse of the gleaming white marble, it feels like you've entered a dream. The symmetry, the intricate carvings, and the sheer scale of the monument are awe-inspiring.\n\nI went early in the morning to avoid the crowds, and the soft light at sunrise made the whole place glow. It was absolutely worth it. The gardens are beautifully maintained, and the atmosphere is peaceful despite the number of visitors. Inside the mausoleum, the craftsmanship is delicate and respectful, though photography is restricted.\n\nTip: Wear comfortable shoes, bring water, and consider hiring a guide to truly appreciate the history and symbolism behind this masterpiece.\n\nWhether you're a history buff, a romantic, or just someone who appreciates beauty, the Taj Mahal is a must-see. It’s not just a monument. It’s a feeling."

Located directly across the Yamuna River, this charbagh (Mughal garden) offers the most stunning and uninterrupted panoramic view of the Taj Mahal, especially as the sun begins to set and the white marble glows in the golden light. It was the ideal spot for our group to relax, take incredible photos, and simply soak in the majestic beauty of one of the world’s wonders in a peaceful, unhurried atmosphere. The gardens themselves are well-maintained and spacious, giving us plenty of room to stroll, sit on the lawns, and enjoy the reflective ambiance away from the noise. Whether you're a photography enthusiast, a history lover, or just looking for a memorable place to unwind with friends, Mehtab Bagh delivers a magical and almost surreal experience. It’s the perfect way to end a day in Agra—calm, beautiful, and utterly unforgettable. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to see the Taj Mahal from a unique and picture-perfect perspective!"

The geometric flower beds, the marble fountains, and that breathtaking view of the white pavilions around it... you’ll forget the chaos outside.\n\nStand at the center, close your eyes — you can almost hear the veiled laughter of the royal zenana and the splash of fountains long silenced by time.\n\nPerfect spot for: ✅ Jaw-dropping photos\n✅ That calm, meditative moment\n✅ Imagining you’re in a Mughal fairytale\n\n📍Tip: Visit early morning for the best light and the least crowd.\n\nThis isn’t just a garden.

Definitely worth it if you like collectibles. The tables, glasses, and antique items are exquisite and worthy of a connoisseur. I purchased a small and beautiful ring box here and got a good discount since we were buying more items for friends. The proprietor doesn't allow items to be photographed. Nevertheless, you may be intrigued by the craft station here where the artists do all the Pietra Dura works and see for yourself how it's done. Many Taj Mahal inspired motifs and designs are their speciality. I was dazzled to see the Pietra Dura replica of the famous painting- The Last Supper.  Overall, a place to visit if you are interested in stone art."

They were rapid with communication and very transparent which put me at ease during the planning process.\n\nThe trip was smoothly executed without any hitch from the moment I was picked up from airport to drop off at the airport.\nAs a solo female traveler they ensured my safety was top priority.\nMy tour guide Riz was punctual, polite, friendly, professional and knowledgeable about the various sites. His recommendations were spot on and he provided concierge services at a top notch level like I have never experienced.\nBest of all, he takes the best pictures and videos. His passion and dedication for his job shines through.\nThank you for going above and beyond the call of duty to ensure I had a pleasant memorable experience in india.\n\nI highly recommend Agra trip packages for tours and trip"

The tour company's owner, Ali, was in touch with me the day before each tour to provide all the information I needed, including what I needed to bring for a seamless trip, and answered any questions that I had. My tour of Delhi, Agra and Jaipur was a great success and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.All of the drivers were very kind and drove carefully on the highways, which I appreciated, and even stopped for me to get some energizing chai along the way. My tour was actually during a holiday weekend so even though the roads and sites were very very crowded, I knew I was in good hands. The 3 guides(  1 for each city,)  really made the trip. They made sure everything went smoothly despite how busy it was and were so incredibly knowledgeable about the Delhi , Taj Agra Fort and the Pink city , providing details that I wouldn't have known otherwise. They also made sure that I got the photos I wanted even with the crowds. I cannot recommend Ali and Aiza tours too much , he is a fantastic tour operator,"

While reaching out to the operator Mr Ali, we shared our preferences of what to see, but let him guide to consolidate and propose an order. Everything was very smooth and well organized.\nWe were picked-up by the guide and driver at the airport, and taken care until drop-off at the airport again a few days later. We felt very comfortable at any time, and whenever we had questions or concerns either Mr. Ali or the guides in Agra and Jaipur took care of us.\nOur tour started in Agra at airport, picked up by the guide Mr Hyder Ali and Mr Jeedu and brought to the hotel. From there, we then visited Agra Fort and the Baby Taj, receiving great insights and background. The next morning, we got to see the beautiful Taj Mahal, again very well guided. After breakfast back in the hotel, we were driven to Jaipur, while stopping on the way at Fatehpur Sikri and at a (tourist) restaurant for lunch. Our driver Mr. Jeedu was very professional and a careful driver, we felt always comfortable.\nIn Jaipur, we started the next day with a visit at the Amber Fort, followed by the Jal Mahal, Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar and City palace. It was a very interesting tour with good inputs. The last day, we then went to the Nahargarh Fort and Jai Garh fort, followed by another stop at the hotel, before then being dropped off at the airport.\n\nThe whole tour was very well organized and I would highly recommend to book with Mr Ali, as he is highly responsive and takes great care of the guests, and reflects all asks and concerns."

Jaipur welcomed us with its royal charm—Amber Fort and City Palace stood as testaments to Rajasthan’s grandeur. The authentic Rajasthani cuisine was a delight, with every bite reflecting tradition and spice. Capturing the beauty of these forts through our lens was a highlight. Agra’s Taj Mahal, ethereal at sunrise, left us spellbound. A special mention to our guide, Ramesh, whose deep knowledge and engaging storytelling added immense value to the experience. His insights brought each monument to life. This journey was truly enriching and beautifully woven with history, heritage, and heartfelt hospitality."

Boating at sunrise and wandering the narrow ghats created lifelong memories. Traveling with friends made every moment joyful—late-night chats, roadside chai, and endless laughter.

And then he will start showing his true color.\nHe took us to all his friends stores and forced us to purchase expensive items from that store. As if he is the sales person of that store. Initially we ignored that as most of the tour guides do the same. But this man kept on taking us one shop after another even after clarifying that we are not interested. Then one point he started imotional blackmailing too. It became so irritating that we thought of ending the tour prematurely.\nI have been to many places in the last few years but never met such a horrible guide."

A staggering sight notwithstanding its status as almost a stock image, the poignancy of the white marble architectural masterpiece led poet Rabindranath Tagore to describe the Taj as “a teardrop on the cheek of eternity.” While the rest of the city can feel a bit crowded with souvenir vendors and tour guides longing to help you preserve your memories of the Taj, the Agra Fort , a well preserved red brick structure built by Emperor Akbar, and Mughal gardens await the traveler ready to look a bit deeper. Likewise, an overnight or two will afford the chance to contemplate the Yamuna river while sampling local petha candy or savory snacks called chaat.",

Unbelievable that it was conceptualised like this centuries ago. Lots of applied science theories on display here & you may spend hours being mesmerised about it. The corridor and route is beautifully maintained and remains clean. Best time is Oct to Feb of the year since summers get a little too hard to bear"

The moment you step through the gates and catch your first glimpse of the gleaming white marble, it feels like you've entered a dream. The symmetry, the intricate carvings, and the sheer scale of the monument are awe-inspiring.\n\nI went early in the morning to avoid the crowds, and the soft light at sunrise made the whole place glow. It was absolutely worth it. The gardens are beautifully maintained, and the atmosphere is peaceful despite the number of visitors. Inside the mausoleum, the craftsmanship is delicate and respectful, though photography is restricted.\n\nTip: Wear comfortable shoes, bring water, and consider hiring a guide to truly appreciate the history and symbolism behind this masterpiece.\n\nWhether you're a history buff, a romantic, or just someone who appreciates beauty, the Taj Mahal is a must-see. It’s not just a monument. It’s a feeling."

Located directly across the Yamuna River, this charbagh (Mughal garden) offers the most stunning and uninterrupted panoramic view of the Taj Mahal, especially as the sun begins to set and the white marble glows in the golden light. It was the ideal spot for our group to relax, take incredible photos, and simply soak in the majestic beauty of one of the world’s wonders in a peaceful, unhurried atmosphere. The gardens themselves are well-maintained and spacious, giving us plenty of room to stroll, sit on the lawns, and enjoy the reflective ambiance away from the noise. Whether you're a photography enthusiast, a history lover, or just looking for a memorable place to unwind with friends, Mehtab Bagh delivers a magical and almost surreal experience. It’s the perfect way to end a day in Agra—calm, beautiful, and utterly unforgettable. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to see the Taj Mahal from a unique and picture-perfect perspective!"

              "reviewText": "Our recent visit to the Tomb of Itmad-ud-Daula was a really good experience, a nice change from the usual super-crowded tourist spots in Agra. The place is right next to the road, so it's easy to get to. We bought our tickets from the counter, which is just to the left as you enter the main gate. It only cost us ₹25 per person.\n\nThe whole complex is so well-kept, hats off to the department taking care of it. Even when the sun was blazing, the gardens were so green and well-maintained that it felt cool and pleasant. The main monument has a red stone frame at the entrance, and inside, there's this beautiful white marble building. To go inside the marble monument, we had to remove our footwear at the foot stand on the left.\n\nWe went without a guide and saw that most people were doing the same. It was nice to just walk around, observe the tiny patterns, and later, we looked up some info on the internet to learn more. A big plus was that there were no sellers bothering us to buy things, which is a rare thing at tourist places here.\n\nThe inside of the structure is also very good. It's a great spot for taking photos, and for people who love nature, you can see the Yamuna River from the side. The cool breeze from the river really made the experience even better. They do have a washroom facility, but when we went, the staff told us there was no water.\n\nOverall, it was a very good experience, especially compared to the other overcrowded places in Agra."

              "reviewText": "Our visit to the Baby Taj (Itimad-ud-Daulah) with friends was a surprisingly delightful and serene highlight of our Agra trip, offering a more intimate and peaceful experience compared to its grander counterpart. Often called the \"jewel box\" or a \"draft of the Taj Mahal,\" this exquisite mausoleum captivated us with its intricate marble inlay work, delicate pietra dura designs, and beautiful gardens along the Yamuna River. Without the overwhelming crowds, we could truly appreciate the craftsmanship up close, wandering through the charbagh gardens and taking stunning photographs of the detailed mosaics and lattice screens. It felt like discovering a hidden gem—a perfect blend of history, art, and tranquility. The calm atmosphere made it ideal for a relaxed yet culturally rich outing with friends, sparking conversations about Mughal architecture and the moving love story behind its creation. For anyone touring Agra, the Baby Taj is an absolute must-see for its understated elegance and historical significance—a peaceful retreat that beautifully showcases the artistry that inspired the Taj Mahal itself."

Built entirely of white marble and inlaid with delicate semi-precious stones, it’s considered the “jewel box” of Mughal architecture and a precursor to the Taj Mahal. The intricate carvings and lattice screens are incredibly detailed and worth admiring up close. Unlike the Taj, the Baby Taj is usually less crowded, offering a peaceful and intimate experience.

A very beautiful park area is available so that children and people can spend the time. Also I got to know from the locals that bad elements are there and bad things happen after the evening and sometimes in the day also which is a very sad thing to share here. I hope the local authorities kindly look into this and keep some security to avoid such a nuisance. The water well is too dirty and is not even clean and is closed. So much work needs to be done. The yamuna river basin is again a top level priority as there is no water left and all the water you can see is of sewage water from the city. Sad to see the destruction of nature done by humans. Deeply saddened to watch the river like this from this place."

It would have been great if there was someone who wiped the benches inside the park so we could sit and enjoy the peaceful tranquility of nature. Some signage would help . Nature has lots of wild birds especially peacocks dancing around. There were three monkeys but they didn't bother us. Some areas of the walks are a bit scary especially where personal security is concerned. Although my wife and I did not feel threatened, someone alone may feel afraid. I don't think there are any security cameras. I am not trying to discourage you from visiting this place. I am just sharing my thoughts and feelings. It took us an hour to walk around. You can see the Taj Mahal at two view points. There are also tracks between bushes which later connect to the main concrete tracks. There is a canteen inside but it is closed. There is a playground for kids and a grass field for picnics. I don't know if you can take food inside but photography cameras are forbidden. Cellphone is ok.  I think the best time is early morning or late afternoon."

The melodious sound of Gurbani kirtan created a divine atmosphere, filling my heart with devotion.\n\nBefore going inside, I covered my head and washed my hands and feet as a mark of respect. Inside the prayer hall, people sat quietly, listening to the recitation of the holy Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Everyone, irrespective of caste, creed, or religion, sat together on the floor, which made me realize the true meaning of equality.\n\nAfter offering my prayers, I went to the Langar hall, where simple but delicious food was being served to all. The spirit of seva (selfless service) touched me deeply, as people volunteered with smiles on their faces.\n\nThe whole experience taught me lessons of humility, equality, and humanity.

              "reviewText": "The Tomb of Akbar the Great, located in Sikandra, Agra, is a remarkable example of Mughal architecture that seamlessly blends grandeur, artistry, and serenity. Constructed between 1605 and 1613 by Akbar’s son, Emperor Jahangir, this magnificent mausoleum was planned and partially built by Akbar himself during his lifetime. Unlike other Mughal tombs, Akbar’s tomb stands out for its unique blend of Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist, and Jain architectural influences — a reflection of the emperor’s inclusive philosophy.\n\nSet within a vast garden complex spread across 119 acres, the tomb is approached through a majestic southern gateway built of red sandstone and adorned with intricate white marble inlay work. Four white marble minarets rise from the corners of this gateway, reminiscent of the ones seen later in the Taj Mahal.\n\nThe main tomb structure, built of deep red sandstone, is decorated with exquisite geometric and floral carvings. The façade is a marvel of detailed craftsmanship, with calligraphy panels and lattice screens showcasing the finesse of Mughal artisanship. In stark contrast to the ornate exterior, the central chamber where Akbar is believed to rest is surprisingly simple — perhaps in keeping with the emperor’s belief in humility and spiritual introspection.\n\nSurrounding the tomb are several subsidiary structures, including the tombs of Akbar’s daughters and other family members, adding historical depth to the site. Peacocks and deer wander freely in the gardens, lending the place an almost ethereal charm. Today, Akbar’s tomb remains not only a monument to an emperor, but a symbol of syncretic heritage and peaceful repose."

The place is very calm and peaceful. I was there for some 2-3 hours relaxing and exploring the place, clicking photographs.\nThe place will offer you parking facilities, eating points outside the monument, water facilities, public toilets, lockers obviously for keeping bags and they will give the key to you once you lock it."

I feel blessed that I have got the opportunity to see the grave of one of the great kings of Indian history.\nThe place is nice, we visited in the month of July, but it is recommended to visit in winters due to heat and humid temperature.\nThe grave in not in original form, Jats of Delhi destroyed the grave and burn the bones of Akbar in 1688, because they were angry from Aurangjeb’s rule.\nBut yes it was renovated at that time and since then it is in its original form.\nGrave is in underground passage which is accessible to public freely. The place is usually less crowded because of not known by outsiders.\n\nTicket price is 30 for Indians and 200-300 for foreigners.\nThe timing is sunrise to sunset."

My recent visit was very satisfying, and I highly recommend it.\n\nRight from the start, we were impressed. There's plenty of parking available, and the entry fee is a very reasonable ₹25 per person. The place immediately welcomes you with a beautifully maintained garden. The greenery is absolutely fascinating, filled with a wide variety of trees that provide ample shade and shelter for countless squirrels and peacocks. There are even stone benches along the pathways, perfect for relaxing and taking in the serene atmosphere.\n\nSecurity guards at the entrance verified our tickets, and the entire compound was very clean and well-kept. We explored the main tomb and appreciated its details, which we supplemented with some online research. A big plus was that the place was not crowded, which made it easier to enjoy the monument and its history at our own pace. You can enter all areas with your footwear except for the main section with Akbar's tomb.\n\nInside the same compound, to the right of the main entrance, you'll find another monument called Kanj Mahal. It's great that a single ticket covers entry to both, giving you more to see.\n\nWhile guides were available, we opted to explore on our own. We also had a pleasant experience with a seller who sold us a fridge magnet at a very fair price like 5 pieces for 100, which was a refreshing change as we didn't encounter any pushy vendors trying to sell overpriced souvenirs. The site also has washrooms, which is always a good thing to note.\n\nOverall, it was a very well-rounded and satisfying experience."

The entrance itself is grand, with a huge gateway decorated in red sandstone and white marble that immediately sets the tone. The blend of Hindu, Islamic, and Persian architectural styles makes it stand out and reflects Akbar’s vision of unity and inclusiveness.\n\nInside the complex, the gardens are vast and serene, with pathways shaded by trees and often dotted with deer and peacocks. The calm atmosphere makes it a perfect spot to just stroll around and take in the history at a relaxed pace. The symmetry of the tomb and the detailed carvings on its walls show the craftsmanship of the Mughal era beautifully.\n\nThe tomb chamber itself feels very solemn and respectful. Knowing that this is the final resting place of Emperor Akbar, one of India’s greatest rulers, adds a sense of reverence. Standing there, you get a glimpse not only of the man’s legacy but also of the grandeur and elegance with which the Mughals built their monuments.\n\nFor travelers, I’d suggest visiting in the morning or late afternoon for the best light and cooler weather. It’s a bit away from the main city attractions, but that also means it’s quieter and less rushed. If you enjoy history, architecture, and peaceful surroundings, Akbar’s Tomb is definitely a must-visit in Agra."

This is not just a restaurant – it's a beacon of hope, courage, and resilience. Run entirely by acid attack survivors, this place embodies strength, dignity, and the true spirit of humanity.\n\nFrom the moment I walked in, I was greeted not only with warm smiles but with an overwhelming sense of purpose. Each woman working there has a powerful story – of pain, of struggle, but most importantly, of survival and triumph. Their confidence, hospitality, and grace turned what was meant to be a simple meal into a deeply emotional and unforgettable journey.\n\nWhat’s incredibly unique is that there is no price on the menu. You eat whatever you like, as much as you want, and pay whatever amount you feel like donating. It’s an act of trust and compassion – one that reflects the soul of this café. The food is delicious, lovingly prepared, and served with immense care. But beyond that, it’s the atmosphere – filled with strength, positivity, and silent stories – that nourishes the heart.\n\nThis café is not just serving food; it’s serving awareness, breaking stigma, and giving acid attack survivors their voice, their agency, and a chance to live with dignity. It’s a living example of how we, as a society, can come together to support, uplift, and empower one another.\n\nIf you're visiting Agra, I urge you to step beyond the usual tourist trail and spend time at this extraordinary place. Listen to their stories, support their mission, and leave not just with a full stomach, but a fuller heart.\n\nThis is more than a restaurant. It’s a revolution – served with love."

To reach here, you will have to walk for 5 to 10 minutes from the Taj East Gate. During evening/night there is no light on the road that leads to this ghat. You need to walk in complete darkness along the outer wall of the Taj, with fireflies showing the way with their sporadic glitters. Being a highly secured zone, you will find many army personnel protecting this place, so safety won't be a concern even during night. This ghat is blessed with a beautiful temple, benches for sitting and a photography spot to capture the breathtaking Taj Mahal. The spectacular silhouette of the Taj during night from this ghat is a sight to behold. I would recommend improved beautification of this ghat for foreign tourist.🩵"

The garden is surrounded by a high wall and features a central water channel with fountains. The water channel is lined with beautiful flower beds and trees.\nThe garden was used by the Mughal emperors as a place of relaxation and retreat. It is said that Shah Jahan would often come here to enjoy the beauty of the garden and spend time with his family.\nCheck My YT Channel- BPS Chauhan VLOGS"

              "reviewText": "Sometimes, the most memorable places aren’t the ones on every postcard — they’re the ones you stumble upon, tucked away from the chaos of traffic and tour groups. That’s exactly how I felt visiting Mariam’s Tomb in Agra. No crowds. No rush. Just birdsong, early morning sun, and the slow, graceful unfolding of Mughal history.\n\nIt’s a little tricky to find — the road leading up to it is narrow and a bit bumpy, and honestly, not many locals seemed to know about it when I asked for directions. But that almost added to its hidden-gem charm. When I finally reached the gates, I was greeted by stillness — not the eerie kind, but the kind that wraps around you like a shawl. Peaceful, understated, and timeless.\n\nThe tomb belongs to Mariam-uz-Zamani, also known as Harka Bai — a Rajput princess from Amber (modern-day Jaipur), and one of the most important women in the Mughal Empire. She was the wife of Emperor Akbar and the mother of Jahangir (Salim), and yet, her tomb is devoid of the pomp and spectacle that marks other royal Mughal monuments. And that’s what makes it even more touching — there’s quiet dignity here, an elegance that doesn’t shout.\n\nInterestingly, this wasn’t always a tomb. It was originally a pleasure pavilion built by Sultan Sikander Lodi in 1495 AD, well before the Mughals arrived. It was only in 1623 AD, during Jahangir’s reign, that the structure was transformed into a tomb for his mother. The original baradari (12-doored pavilion) now houses over 40 chambers on the ground floor, many with faint remnants of painted plaster walls — ghostly, but beautiful in their decay.\n\nThe central cenotaph of Mariam rests on the ground floor, but climb up to the upper level, and you’ll find a marble cenotaph open to the sky, as if deliberately designed to invite the heavens in.\n\nThe architecture is classic Mughal but not overbearing — red sandstone façades, adorned with finely carved geometric patterns, and topped with octagonal corner towers, each crowned with delicate chhatris (pavilions). It’s restrained, tasteful, and deeply harmonious with the lush gardens that surround it.\n\nI went in the early morning, and I highly recommend you do the same. The sunrise light hits the sandstone just right, giving it a soft, amber glow. The only sounds were my footsteps, the rustle of trees, and the occasional cooing of pigeons.\n\nWhat struck me most was how well-maintained the site was, despite being relatively unknown. It felt like a little slice of forgotten history, lovingly preserved for those who take the trouble to look for it. I spent nearly an hour just sitting under one of the shady trees, reading and soaking in the atmosphere.\n\nBut a word of caution: While the monument's remoteness and quiet is its greatest aspect, please be aware of people, especially young adult boys, hanging around the inside of the monument in small groups, apparently doing nothing much. I found one such group sitting on the stairs leading to the tomb in the basement, and there was something about them I did not like, because of which I did not go ahead and went out instead. If you are with family, especially young children, women or girls, I would suggest you err on the side of caution, despite there being 1-2 guards I saw at the entrance to the monument."

This place contains many structured pillars. It has a central position at some height on which emperor used to sit and address their audience. This is an architectural marvel. From the place of emperor, he was able to see everyone despite of having so many pillars in the hall."

              "reviewText": "Diwan-i-Khas: Jewel of Mughal Architecture, is situated within Agra Fort in Uttar Pradesh, India, stands as a magnificent testament to Mughal architectural brilliance. This exquisite hall embodies the artistic sophistication and grandeur that characterized the empire at its height.\n\nBuilt in 1635 during Emperor Shah Jahan's reign, Diwan-i-Khas served as a private audience hall where the emperor received foreign ambassadors, nobles, and dignitaries to discuss matters of state. Beyond its political function, the hall's opulent design showcases the Mughal court's seamless blend of elegance and authority.\n\nThe structure features two distinct sections, an outer columned hall and an inner chamber called Tambi Khana. The outer hall captivates visitors with its intricately carved marble pillars adorned with semi-precious stone inlays. These pillars display vibrant floral patterns, a signature element of Mughal decorative art that celebrates nature's beauty.\n\nOpen on three sides with five graceful arches supported by ornate double columns, the hall creates an airy atmosphere. This thoughtful design allows natural light to flood the space while providing uninterrupted views of the surroundings, perfectly suited to its royal purpose.\n\nThe hall's flat wooden ceiling, originally embellished with gold and silver leaf, represents one of its most striking features. This sumptuous decoration would have reflected sunlight, creating a dazzling effect throughout the space. Though time has diminished some of this splendor, remnants of the intricate work continue to mesmerize visitors. The interior walls feature delicate floral inlay work and Persian inscriptions that add cultural and artistic depth.\n\nDiwan-i-Khas holds profound historical significance beyond its architectural beauty. Emperor Shah Jahan conducted official ceremonies here, received foreign envoys, and made decisions that shaped the empire's future. The hall also hosted cultural gatherings, highlighting the court's patronage of the arts.\n\nOne of the hall's most famous associations is with the legendary Peacock Throne. This extraordinary creation, encrusted with precious gems, originally resided in Diwan-i-Khas before being moved to Delhi's Red Fort. This connection further enhances the hall's historical importance.\n\nLocated within Agra Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site renowned for its massive red sandstone walls, Diwan-i-Khas benefits from the fort's rich historical context. The fort served as the primary residence of Mughal emperors until the capital relocated to Delhi. Within this complex, Diwan-i-Khas occupies a strategic position near the emperor's quarters, offering visitors insight into Mughal governance and lifestyle.\n\nThe hall's setting enhances its charm. From its open arches, visitors enjoy serene views of the Yamuna River and glimpses of the Taj Mahal in the distance. This harmonious integration of natural beauty and architectural refinement creates a peaceful atmosphere.\n\nSurrounding Diwan-i-Khas are verdant gardens and peaceful courtyards that contrast beautifully with Agra Fort's imposing architecture. These green spaces invite contemplation of the site's rich historical and cultural significance.\n\nWalking through Diwan-i-Khas transports visitors to an era of imperial splendor. Its detailed craftsmanship and historical importance leave a lasting impression, providing a window into Shah Jahan's reign and the Mughal era's cultural heritage.\n\nDiwan-i-Khas transcends being merely an architectural wonder; it stands as a living monument to the artistry, diplomacy, and luxury of the Mughal Empire, an essential destination for history enthusiasts, architecture admirers, and anyone seeking connection with India's illustrious past."

You walk through these scalloped arches and suddenly you're in the 1600s, standing exactly where commoners once pleaded their cases before the mighty Mughal emperor.\n\nIt’s grand, yet grounded. Humble red sandstone pillars with royal symmetry. And that throne area? You can feel the weight of decisions once made there — love, justice, war, fate.\n\nPro tip: Stand in the center of the hall and clap. The acoustics still carry your voice like whispers of the past.\n\n📸 A must-click for architecture lovers, history nerds, and anyone who’s ever wanted to walk through a Netflix period drama set.\n\n#DiwanIAam #AgraFortChronicles #LostInHistory #MughalMajesty #EchoesOfThePast"

The marble dias below this chamber was known as 'Baithak'. It used to serve as the seat for Wazir, who presented petitions to the emperor.\nIt is said that the hall used to have silver balustrades for the nobility, where they could stand according to their ranks and the outlines of the columns and the spandrels were done in gold."

The full Fort area is covered by boundary so that no stray animal or any kind of unwanted people can't enter without authorization. The entrance is done through online payment and using QR code. Perhaps a little bit of  upgrade is required there (because payment through UPI doesn't work properly, it failed for me through Amazon Pay), otherwise this trip was a delight."

After an hour they will leave you alone to wander around Agra Fort. We did not hire a guide. We did most research online and there was some information provided. A good walking shoe will be helpful. This place will be a challenge for those who find it challenging to climb stairs. However, you can see most of the fort in a wheelchair. We spent 90 minutes here and covered other sites in Agra. You can buy tickets online too. If you went to Taj Mahal a day before, don't throw the Taj tickets away because you will get a reduced price at Agra. It is worth a visit... As a foreigner, you will pay a foreign price while nationals will pay a lower price. You can also see the Taj Mahal from Agra fort. Don't forget to bring a long lens camera with you."

They asked Rs 1800 at the entry saying that it is huge. We almost fell for it but resisted as my son was not keen. if you take it outside. We resisted temptation and walked in. After the gates, another guide agreed at one third of the cost outside.\n\nI strongly recommend that you take a guide to explain everything. One key part is that even though it looks massive from outside, only 25% of it is actually available for tourists. The remaining fort is under the army. The fort is very well maintained and a must visit place"

These comprise the Jahangiri Mahal and Akbari Mahal, both approached through a beautiful gate decorated with red sandstone and yellow dholpur stone. The palaces inside are small, made almost completely of red sandstone, very intricately carved, and with some traces of beautiful painted and incised plaster.\n\nThe Agra Fort ticket, Rs 35 per Indian adult, covers these palaces. An interesting artefact just outside the gate here is Jahangir's bath tub, shaped like a giant tea cup with rough steps on the side to climb in."

The gate takes one to inside the main fort. Beside there is bath tub of 5 feet heights and 8 feet width where you can see the beautiful lawn and open gate alongside. As per stories it’s not an original place of jahangir rather Akbar’s. It was British who changed it to show case and now it became part of tourists attraction over Akbar’s palace. Visit and see the palace and area of history. I enjoyed hope you do too ❤️❤️"

Mughal empress Nur Jahan used this magnificent palace as her residence until her death.\n\nAgra Fort is a beautifully built fort and has great historic significance. The place is well maintained and we had a great time here. The information boards providing the information about the history associated with the place were also very helpful in appreciating the place further. The view of the Taj Mahal from the fort is also a very pleasant sight. The fort also conducts a light and sound show which is also a treat to watch.\n\nFor more details you can visit the blog at\nwayfareradi.wordpress[dot]com"

Otherwise it was great experience to be there. Staff is well trained and also behave well but one thing to keep in mind that there is no drinking water facility inside the park you just have to purchase new water bottles from the canteen which costs around 30 rupees and you just have to buy a new bottle again and again cos you feel more thirsty due to the heat in summer and the long walk you take inside the park😄 So keep this in mind."

Located across the Yamuna River, this viewpoint offers a tranquil and unobstructed view of the iconic monument, making it a perfect spot for photography enthusiasts and those seeking a serene escape from the bustling crowds of the main complex.The area is well-maintained by the Agra Development Authority (ADA), with clean pathways and strategically placed benches that allow visitors to sit and soak in the beauty of the Taj Mahal at leisure. The lush green surroundings and the calming sound of the river add to the overall experience, creating a peaceful atmosphere that is ideal for contemplation and relaxation.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Taj View Point is the sunset view. As the sun descends, the marble of the Taj Mahal takes on a warm, golden hue, creating a mesmerizing sight that is often less crowded and more intimate than the views from within the main grounds. This spot is also excellent for early morning visits, when the soft morning light bathes the monument in a gentle glow. The facilities at the viewpoint are adequate, with clean restrooms and a few vendors offering refreshments. However, more could be done to enhance the visitor experience, such as providing informative plaques about the history and architecture of the Taj Mahal. Accessibility to the Taj View Point is convenient, with ample parking space and easy access for both locals and tourists. It is an ideal spot for those who want to enjoy the magnificence of the Taj Mahal from a different angle without the hassle of navigating through the main entrance's heavy tourist traffic.\n\nIn conclusion, the Taj View Point ADA offers a serene and picturesque vantage point to admire one of the world's most famous monuments. It provides a peaceful retreat and a unique perspective, making it a valuable addition to any Agra itinerary."

              "reviewText": "To the west of the Taj Mahal is the mosque built by Shah Jahan of red sandstone to create a color contrast with the dominance of white and gray on the crown and its four minarets.\n\nIt is a building of red sandstone inlaid with rectangular white marble. Each corner of the rectangle is equipped with an octagonal tower, rather narrow, ending in a chatri (a type of typical Hindu kiosk). On the roof there are 3 domes, one in the center and two on the right and left. They are identical except for size, as the central dome is larger than the other two. They look like two drops of water on the dome of the shrine, with two decorations each.\nThe decoration at its base consists of two lines of geometric patterns, and one at the top is an inverted lotus. The lotus is a symbolic flower in the Hindu religion, denoting the continuity of life, human adaptation to his environment, and renewal. Each chhatri and dome has a bronze arrow pointing towards the sky.\n\nThe mosque has three entrances. The main entrance is in the centre, entered through a wide iwan (a broad, high and shallow gallery typical of Persian architecture) decorated with carvings of black marble on a white marble headband. These are Quranic inscriptions as they are on the shrine. There are also stylized flowers as in the shrine. They're made with pietra dura, which is a technique of veneering stones onto a stone backing (jeweler's inlays, for that). This technique was developed by the Florentines during the 15th century and it was they who came to Agra here to make these ornaments. The other two entrances are similar to the main entrance, but they do not contain an iwan whose decorations adorn directly above the door, so it is more modest. Both openings for the false window above, are both identical in doorways.\n\nThe rest of the walls of the mosque are richly decorated with marble. The decorations consist mainly of floral and botanical motifs, and sometimes simple geometric patterns. The whole is of great symmetry and the overall impression is nice. The Taj Mahal Mosque is of great beauty.\n\nInternally, being a mosque in use, it is equipped with the necessities for the practice of Islam: the lower wall has been given a mihrab, a kind of mihrab on a human scale surmounted by a semicircular vault. The imam stands at this place, which symbolizes the holiest point in the mosque. By comparison, the choir in the church, the place where believers do not give up. The mosque also contains a pulpit from which the priest preaches. The Taj Mahal's minbar is located on the right side of the mihrab. The covering of the mosque is made of rugs, and there are 596 places in the mosque. The inside is as ornate as the outside, and there are many Quranic verses inscribed on the walls in scales.\n\nThe mosque also contains a small stone chamber measuring 5.5 by 2 metres, which was used to protect the remains of Mumtaz Mahal during the few days before their burial, after they were brought to Agra. Finally, the basin in front of the mosque, between it and the shrine, is used for the initial ablutions for prayer."

They asked for money once we got to the fort compound, and i paid them 200rs. they weren’t violent or rough about it… i’d recommend this spot for anyone who’s interested in this unique view of the taj.\n\nthink smart, experiment with different possibilities, use a satellite map, and you’ll get there. where there’s a will, there’s a way :)"

Every day this mausoleum attracts lakhs of visitors from all over the world. The entry fee is kept at ₹50 for Indians (for garden only), but if you book it online by scanning the QR code then you will get some discount. The East Gate is the most convenient and organised gate to enter the Taj. Security protocols are at par with airports. The garden offers a mesmerising view of the grand monument. Photographers are available inside, who can shoot your photos in DSLR in various poses and give you the option to choose either soft copies or hard copies or both. The delivery time of photos is also unbelievably quick. The Taj can be cherished from different parts of the garden and each zone offers a different view. When the sun ☀️ rays fall on the Taj, if offers a heavenly sight to the spectators. Hence, sunrise & sunset are the best times to visit this place. Make sure to visit the Taj Museum too, which is situated in the garden premises and it doesn't cost extra. Highly recommended to visit this extraordinary UNESCO World Heritage site.🏩"

One cannot have a look at it from outside. The entry to the garden is from the North Avenue side. One has to pass through several check-outs before one actually steps into the garden.

Trees line the pathways, providing shade from the hot Indian sun, as well as fruits and fragrances to please the senses.\n\nThe garden at the Taj complex covers an area of 300 meters by 300 meters and is based on the geometric arrangement and symmetry. The trees of the garden are either Cyprus which signifies death or the fruit-bearing types which signify life and are perfectly arranged in symmetrical pattern.\n\nAt the crossing of the walkways in the centre of the garden is a raised platform (chabutra) of white marble with an ornamental pool (hauz) containing five fountains. Kanbo claimed eulogistically that it held the water of the celestial Kausar, the Propher's river in Paradise, which fills the pool at which believers bench their thirst on arrival.\n\nThe waterworks, which brought water to the Taj garden from the Yamuna by means of an aqueduct supported on arches, are situated outside its western wall and still preserve their original design. The inlet from the river is no longer visible\r."

The Taj Mahal complex is situated on a platform on the banks of the Yamuna River..\n\n• It was constructed using white marble.​\n• It has a rectangular base having minarets on all four corners.​\n• The gates have arches.​\n• It has a big dome with lotus motif on its top.​\n• The walls are adorned with carvings of verses from the Quran. It has a variety of beautiful floral patterns​.\n\nThe base structure is a large multi-chambered cube with chamfered corners, forming an eight-sided structure that is approximately 57.3 metres long on each of the four long sides. The building has four identical sides with arch-shaped doorways, topped by a large dome and finial. Each side of the iwan is framed with a 33-metre high vaulted archway with two similarly shaped arched balconies stacked on either side. The onion-shaped dome sits on a 12-metre high cylindrical drum with an inner diameter of 18.4 metres.\n\nTaj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653, it was said to have cost 32 million Indian rupees then (or, about four hundred thousand USD). Some say, it would take around $ 70 billion if you were to construct it today.\n\nConstruction of the mausoleum was completed in 1648, but work continued on other phases of the project for another five years. The mausoleum is constructed of white marble inlaid with semi-precious stones, while red sandstone was used for other buildings in the complex, similar to other Mughal-era buildings. The construction project employed more than 20,000 workers and artisans under the guidance of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the emperor's court architect.The most impressive in the Taj Mahal complex next to the tomb, is the main gate which stands majestically in the centre of the southern wall of the forecourt. The gate is flanked on the north front by double arcade galleries.\n\nThe design represents the finest and most sophisticated example of Indo-Islamic and Mughal architecture. In 1983, the Taj Mahal was recognized as \"the jewel of Islamic art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.\""

Located on the eastern side of the Taj Mahal complex, the Mehmaan Khana, or \"Guest House,\" offers a fascinating glimpse into the grandeur and hospitality of the Mughal era.\n\nArchitecturally, the Mehmaan Khana mirrors the design elegance of the Taj Mahal, constructed with the same pristine white marble and intricate inlay work that characterizes the main mausoleum. The symmetry and meticulous craftsmanship are evident in every detail, from the exquisite lattice screens (jalis) to the elegant arches and domes. This building, like the Taj itself, exemplifies the perfect blend of Persian and Indian architectural styles that is a hallmark of Mughal architecture.\n\nHistorically, the Mehmaan Khana served as a place to accommodate guests who came to pay their respects at the Taj Mahal. Its purpose underscores the Mughals' renowned tradition of hospitality and their penchant for creating spaces that are not only functional but also aesthetically stunning.\n\nVisiting the Mehmaan Khana provides a quieter, more contemplative experience compared to the main mausoleum, allowing visitors to fully appreciate the intricate artistry and serene environment. It's a place where you can take a moment to sit and reflect, soaking in the ambiance of a bygone era while enjoying a unique perspective of the Taj Mahal.\n\nIn summary, the Mehmaan Khana at the Taj Mahal is a must-see for anyone wanting to delve deeper into the history and architectural brilliance of the Mughal period. It enriches the visit to the Taj Mahal, offering an added layer of beauty and historical context that should not be missed."

As I stood before its white domes glowing under the soft sun, I felt a sense of peace, wonder, and emotion that words can barely hold.\n\nThe symmetry, the carvings, the calm reflection in the water—it all felt surreal, like I had stepped into a dream. The air was quiet, yet filled with stories of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz, of eternal love and undying memories.\n\nFor a moment, I stood still—not as a traveler, but as a soul touched by beauty, history, and devotion.\n\nThe Taj Mahal is more than just a wonder. It’s a feeling that stays with you, long after you've left.\n\n📍 Agra Moments | Monument of Love | Memory for a Lifetime"

              "reviewText": "The Taj Mahal is truly one of the most breathtaking monuments in the world and an experience that words can hardly capture. Seeing it in person is far more magical than any photo or video.\n\nThe white marble structure changes its shades with the sunlight – golden at sunrise, sparkling white in the day, and bluish under moonlight. The intricate carvings, the delicate inlay work with semi-precious stones, and the perfect symmetry are beyond imagination. It’s not just architecture, but a timeless symbol of love and devotion.\n\nPractical Tips:\n\nTimings: Open sunrise to sunset (closed on Fridays). Early morning is the best time to avoid heavy crowds and enjoy a peaceful view.\n\nTickets: Available online or at counters; prices vary for Indians, foreigners, and SAARC citizens. Kids under 15 enter free.\n\nSecurity: Only essentials like small bags, cameras, and water bottles are allowed. Food, tobacco, and large electronics are restricted.\n\nGuides: Hiring a guide or using the official audio tour helps you understand the history and stories behind the Taj.\n\nBest Views: The main gate (Darwaza), the central reflecting pool, and the Yamuna riverside at the back are perfect for photos.\n\nThe entire complex is well maintained with beautiful gardens and pathways that enhance the serenity of the place. Though it can get crowded, especially on weekends, the moment you stand before it, everything else fades away.\nThe Taj Mahal is not just a monument – it’s poetry in stone, a proud heritage of India, and an unforgettable experience that stays with you forever."

The moment you step through the gates and catch your first glimpse of the gleaming white marble, it feels like you've entered a dream. The symmetry, the intricate carvings, and the sheer scale of the monument are awe-inspiring.\n\nI went early in the morning to avoid the crowds, and the soft light at sunrise made the whole place glow. It was absolutely worth it. The gardens are beautifully maintained, and the atmosphere is peaceful despite the number of visitors. Inside the mausoleum, the craftsmanship is delicate and respectful, though photography is restricted.\n\nTip: Wear comfortable shoes, bring water, and consider hiring a guide to truly appreciate the history and symbolism behind this masterpiece.\n\nWhether you're a history buff, a romantic, or just someone who appreciates beauty, the Taj Mahal is a must-see. It’s not just a monument. It’s a feeling."

A very beautiful park area is available so that children and people can spend the time. Also I got to know from the locals that bad elements are there and bad things happen after the evening and sometimes in the day also which is a very sad thing to share here. I hope the local authorities kindly look into this and keep some security to avoid such a nuisance. The water well is too dirty and is not even clean and is closed. So much work needs to be done. The yamuna river basin is again a top level priority as there is no water left and all the water you can see is of sewage water from the city. Sad to see the destruction of nature done by humans. Deeply saddened to watch the river like this from this place."

The melodious sound of Gurbani kirtan created a divine atmosphere, filling my heart with devotion.\n\nBefore going inside, I covered my head and washed my hands and feet as a mark of respect. Inside the prayer hall, people sat quietly, listening to the recitation of the holy Guru Granth Sahib Ji. Everyone, irrespective of caste, creed, or religion, sat together on the floor, which made me realize the true meaning of equality.\n\nAfter offering my prayers, I went to the Langar hall, where simple but delicious food was being served to all. The spirit of seva (selfless service) touched me deeply, as people volunteered with smiles on their faces.\n\nThe whole experience taught me lessons of humility, equality, and humanity. A Gurudwara is not just a place of worship but also a symbol of love, service, and unity."

Located directly across the Yamuna River, this charbagh (Mughal garden) offers the most stunning and uninterrupted panoramic view of the Taj Mahal, especially as the sun begins to set and the white marble glows in the golden light. It was the ideal spot for our group to relax, take incredible photos, and simply soak in the majestic beauty of one of the world’s wonders in a peaceful, unhurried atmosphere. The gardens themselves are well-maintained and spacious, giving us plenty of room to stroll, sit on the lawns, and enjoy the reflective ambiance away from the noise. Whether you're a photography enthusiast, a history lover, or just looking for a memorable place to unwind with friends, Mehtab Bagh delivers a magical and almost surreal experience. It’s the perfect way to end a day in Agra—calm, beautiful, and utterly unforgettable. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to see the Taj Mahal from a unique and picture-perfect perspective!"

Built by Emperor Shah Jahan between 1648 and 1654, the \"Pearl Mosque,\" as its name translates, is celebrated for its pristine white marble construction, which gives it a glowing, ethereal quality, much like a pearl.\n\nThe mosque's design is a testament to Shah Jahan's architectural genius, showcasing a perfect blend of elegance and simplicity. The three domes of the mosque, made entirely of white marble, rise gracefully above the structure, while the finely crafted arches and pillars add to its aesthetic appeal. The interior of the mosque is equally impressive, with a spacious prayer hall that exudes serenity and peace. The marble flooring, inlaid with intricate designs, complements the mosque's understated beauty.\n\nMoti Masjid served as a private mosque for the emperor and his court, reflecting the importance of faith in the daily lives of the Mughal rulers. The mosque’s small size, compared to other monumental structures of the time, adds to its charm, making it a place of quiet contemplation amidst the grandeur of Agra Fort.\n\nSurrounded by lush gardens and the imposing walls of the fort, Moti Masjid offers a tranquil escape from the bustling tourist spots of Agra. Its flawless marble construction and serene ambiance make it one of the hidden gems of Agra, offering visitors a glimpse into the spiritual side of the Mughal emperors."

Built between 1631-40 in the northwestern corner of the Machchhi Bhawan, it has a marble paved court enclosed by walls to the north, south and east and the prayer chamber on the west. The prayer chamber is also made up of marble and has three domes on its top. The mosque has a three-arched façade with the cusps and supported on slender piers as its entrance. The arch in the middle is larger and has nine cusps and ones on the either sides have seven cusps only.\n\nThe mihrab pointing the direction of Holy Kabah is situated on the western wall of the prayer chamber. The arches have a broad projecting chhajja on three sides. The distinctive feature of the mosque that makes it stand apart from other buildings of the fort is above the arches. A curve can also be seen in the middle of the façade i.e. in the chhajja as well as in the parapet, which gives extra importance to the central part in the façade. This feature known as bangladar is a distinctive characteristic of this mosque. The three bulbous domes are crowned by inverted lotus and finials and the central one is larger than the other two."

              "reviewText": "Sometimes, the most memorable places aren’t the ones on every postcard — they’re the ones you stumble upon, tucked away from the chaos of traffic and tour groups. That’s exactly how I felt visiting Mariam’s Tomb in Agra. No crowds. No rush. Just birdsong, early morning sun, and the slow, graceful unfolding of Mughal history.\n\nIt’s a little tricky to find — the road leading up to it is narrow and a bit bumpy, and honestly, not many locals seemed to know about it when I asked for directions. But that almost added to its hidden-gem charm. When I finally reached the gates, I was greeted by stillness — not the eerie kind, but the kind that wraps around you like a shawl. Peaceful, understated, and timeless.\n\nThe tomb belongs to Mariam-uz-Zamani, also known as Harka Bai — a Rajput princess from Amber (modern-day Jaipur), and one of the most important women in the Mughal Empire. She was the wife of Emperor Akbar and the mother of Jahangir (Salim), and yet, her tomb is devoid of the pomp and spectacle that marks other royal Mughal monuments. And that’s what makes it even more touching — there’s quiet dignity here, an elegance that doesn’t shout.\n\nInterestingly, this wasn’t always a tomb. It was originally a pleasure pavilion built by Sultan Sikander Lodi in 1495 AD, well before the Mughals arrived. It was only in 1623 AD, during Jahangir’s reign, that the structure was transformed into a tomb for his mother. The original baradari (12-doored pavilion) now houses over 40 chambers on the ground floor, many with faint remnants of painted plaster walls — ghostly, but beautiful in their decay.\n\nThe central cenotaph of Mariam rests on the ground floor, but climb up to the upper level, and you’ll find a marble cenotaph open to the sky, as if deliberately designed to invite the heavens in.\n\nThe architecture is classic Mughal but not overbearing — red sandstone façades, adorned with finely carved geometric patterns, and topped with octagonal corner towers, each crowned with delicate chhatris (pavilions). It’s restrained, tasteful, and deeply harmonious with the lush gardens that surround it.\n\nI went in the early morning, and I highly recommend you do the same. The sunrise light hits the sandstone just right, giving it a soft, amber glow. The only sounds were my footsteps, the rustle of trees, and the occasional cooing of pigeons.\n\nWhat struck me most was how well-maintained the site was, despite being relatively unknown. It felt like a little slice of forgotten history, lovingly preserved for those who take the trouble to look for it. I spent nearly an hour just sitting under one of the shady trees, reading and soaking in the atmosphere.\n\nBut a word of caution: While the monument's remoteness and quiet is its greatest aspect, please be aware of people, especially young adult boys, hanging around the inside of the monument in small groups, apparently doing nothing much. I found one such group sitting on the stairs leading to the tomb in the basement, and there was something about them I did not like, because of which I did not go ahead and went out instead. If you are with family, especially young children, women or girls, I would suggest you err on the side of caution, despite there being 1-2 guards I saw at the entrance to the monument."

The place is right next to the road, so it's easy to get to. We bought our tickets from the counter, which is just to the left as you enter the main gate. It only cost us ₹25 per person.\n\nThe whole complex is so well-kept, hats off to the department taking care of it. Even when the sun was blazing, the gardens were so green and well-maintained that it felt cool and pleasant. The main monument has a red stone frame at the entrance, and inside, there's this beautiful white marble building. To go inside the marble monument, we had to remove our footwear at the foot stand on the left.\n\nWe went without a guide and saw that most people were doing the same. It was nice to just walk around, observe the tiny patterns, and later, we looked up some info on the internet to learn more. A big plus was that there were no sellers bothering us to buy things, which is a rare thing at tourist places here.\n\nThe inside of the structure is also very good. It's a great spot for taking photos, and for people who love nature, you can see the Yamuna River from the side. The cool breeze from the river really made the experience even better. They do have a washroom facility, but when we went, the staff told us there was no water.\n\nOverall, it was a very good experience, especially compared to the other overcrowded places in Agra."

Often called the \"jewel box\" or a \"draft of the Taj Mahal,\" this exquisite mausoleum captivated us with its intricate marble inlay work, delicate pietra dura designs, and beautiful gardens along the Yamuna River. Without the overwhelming crowds, we could truly appreciate the craftsmanship up close, wandering through the charbagh gardens and taking stunning photographs of the detailed mosaics and lattice screens. It felt like discovering a hidden gem—a perfect blend of history, art, and tranquility. The calm atmosphere made it ideal for a relaxed yet culturally rich outing with friends, sparking conversations about Mughal architecture and the moving love story behind its creation. For anyone touring Agra, the Baby Taj is an absolute must-see for its understated elegance and historical significance—a peaceful retreat that beautifully showcases the artistry that inspired the Taj Mahal itself."

Built entirely of white marble and inlaid with delicate semi-precious stones, it’s considered the “jewel box” of Mughal architecture and a precursor to the Taj Mahal. The intricate carvings and lattice screens are incredibly detailed and worth admiring up close. Unlike the Taj, the Baby Taj is usually less crowded, offering a peaceful and intimate experience. The serene gardens and quiet atmosphere make it a perfect place to soak in history and beauty without the hustle. A must-visit spot for anyone exploring Agra."

              "reviewText": "The Tomb of Akbar the Great, located in Sikandra, Agra, is a remarkable example of Mughal architecture that seamlessly blends grandeur, artistry, and serenity. Constructed between 1605 and 1613 by Akbar’s son, Emperor Jahangir, this magnificent mausoleum was planned and partially built by Akbar himself during his lifetime. Unlike other Mughal tombs, Akbar’s tomb stands out for its unique blend of Hindu, Islamic, Buddhist, and Jain architectural influences — a reflection of the emperor’s inclusive philosophy.\n\nSet within a vast garden complex spread across 119 acres, the tomb is approached through a majestic southern gateway built of red sandstone and adorned with intricate white marble inlay work. Four white marble minarets rise from the corners of this gateway, reminiscent of the ones seen later in the Taj Mahal.\n\nThe main tomb structure, built of deep red sandstone, is decorated with exquisite geometric and floral carvings. The façade is a marvel of detailed craftsmanship, with calligraphy panels and lattice screens showcasing the finesse of Mughal artisanship. In stark contrast to the ornate exterior, the central chamber where Akbar is believed to rest is surprisingly simple — perhaps in keeping with the emperor’s belief in humility and spiritual introspection.\n\nSurrounding the tomb are several subsidiary structures, including the tombs of Akbar’s daughters and other family members, adding historical depth to the site. Peacocks and deer wander freely in the gardens, lending the place an almost ethereal charm. Today, Akbar’s tomb remains not only a monument to an emperor, but a symbol of syncretic heritage and peaceful repose."

I feel blessed that I have got the opportunity to see the grave of one of the great kings of Indian history.\nThe place is nice, we visited in the month of July, but it is recommended to visit in winters due to heat and humid temperature.\nThe grave in not in original form, Jats of Delhi destroyed the grave and burn the bones of Akbar in 1688, because they were angry from Aurangjeb’s rule.\nBut yes it was renovated at that time and since then it is in its original form.\nGrave is in underground passage which is accessible to public freely. The place is usually less crowded because of not known by outsiders.\n\nTicket price is 30 for Indians and 200-300 for foreigners.\nThe timing is sunrise to sunset."

My recent visit was very satisfying, and I highly recommend it.\n\nRight from the start, we were impressed. There's plenty of parking available, and the entry fee is a very reasonable ₹25 per person. The place immediately welcomes you with a beautifully maintained garden. The greenery is absolutely fascinating, filled with a wide variety of trees that provide ample shade and shelter for countless squirrels and peacocks. There are even stone benches along the pathways, perfect for relaxing and taking in the serene atmosphere.\n\nSecurity guards at the entrance verified our tickets, and the entire compound was very clean and well-kept. We explored the main tomb and appreciated its details, which we supplemented with some online research. A big plus was that the place was not crowded, which made it easier to enjoy the monument and its history at our own pace. You can enter all areas with your footwear except for the main section with Akbar's tomb.\n\nInside the same compound, to the right of the main entrance, you'll find another monument called Kanj Mahal. It's great that a single ticket covers entry to both, giving you more to see.\n\nWhile guides were available, we opted to explore on our own. We also had a pleasant experience with a seller who sold us a fridge magnet at a very fair price like 5 pieces for 100, which was a refreshing change as we didn't encounter any pushy vendors trying to sell overpriced souvenirs. The site also has washrooms, which is always a good thing to note.\n\nOverall, it was a very well-rounded and satisfying experience."

The entrance itself is grand, with a huge gateway decorated in red sandstone and white marble that immediately sets the tone. The blend of Hindu, Islamic, and Persian architectural styles makes it stand out and reflects Akbar’s vision of unity and inclusiveness.\n\nInside the complex, the gardens are vast and serene, with pathways shaded by trees and often dotted with deer and peacocks. The calm atmosphere makes it a perfect spot to just stroll around and take in the history at a relaxed pace. The symmetry of the tomb and the detailed carvings on its walls show the craftsmanship of the Mughal era beautifully.\n\nThe tomb chamber itself feels very solemn and respectful. Knowing that this is the final resting place of Emperor Akbar, one of India’s greatest rulers, adds a sense of reverence. Standing there, you get a glimpse not only of the man’s legacy but also of the grandeur and elegance with which the Mughals built their monuments.\n\nFor travelers, I’d suggest visiting in the morning or late afternoon for the best light and cooler weather. It’s a bit away from the main city attractions, but that also means it’s quieter and less rushed. If you enjoy history, architecture, and peaceful surroundings, Akbar’s Tomb is definitely a must-visit in Agra."

              "reviewText": "Diwan-i-Khas: Jewel of Mughal Architecture, is situated within Agra Fort in Uttar Pradesh, India, stands as a magnificent testament to Mughal architectural brilliance. This exquisite hall embodies the artistic sophistication and grandeur that characterized the empire at its height.\n\nBuilt in 1635 during Emperor Shah Jahan's reign, Diwan-i-Khas served as a private audience hall where the emperor received foreign ambassadors, nobles, and dignitaries to discuss matters of state. Beyond its political function, the hall's opulent design showcases the Mughal court's seamless blend of elegance and authority.\n\nThe structure features two distinct sections, an outer columned hall and an inner chamber called Tambi Khana. The outer hall captivates visitors with its intricately carved marble pillars adorned with semi-precious stone inlays. These pillars display vibrant floral patterns, a signature element of Mughal decorative art that celebrates nature's beauty.\n\nOpen on three sides with five graceful arches supported by ornate double columns, the hall creates an airy atmosphere. This thoughtful design allows natural light to flood the space while providing uninterrupted views of the surroundings, perfectly suited to its royal purpose.\n\nThe hall's flat wooden ceiling, originally embellished with gold and silver leaf, represents one of its most striking features. This sumptuous decoration would have reflected sunlight, creating a dazzling effect throughout the space. Though time has diminished some of this splendor, remnants of the intricate work continue to mesmerize visitors. The interior walls feature delicate floral inlay work and Persian inscriptions that add cultural and artistic depth.\n\nDiwan-i-Khas holds profound historical significance beyond its architectural beauty. Emperor Shah Jahan conducted official ceremonies here, received foreign envoys, and made decisions that shaped the empire's future. The hall also hosted cultural gatherings, highlighting the court's patronage of the arts.\n\nOne of the hall's most famous associations is with the legendary Peacock Throne. This extraordinary creation, encrusted with precious gems, originally resided in Diwan-i-Khas before being moved to Delhi's Red Fort. This connection further enhances the hall's historical importance.\n\nLocated within Agra Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage Site renowned for its massive red sandstone walls, Diwan-i-Khas benefits from the fort's rich historical context. The fort served as the primary residence of Mughal emperors until the capital relocated to Delhi. Within this complex, Diwan-i-Khas occupies a strategic position near the emperor's quarters, offering visitors insight into Mughal governance and lifestyle.\n\nThe hall's setting enhances its charm. From its open arches, visitors enjoy serene views of the Yamuna River and glimpses of the Taj Mahal in the distance. This harmonious integration of natural beauty and architectural refinement creates a peaceful atmosphere.\n\nSurrounding Diwan-i-Khas are verdant gardens and peaceful courtyards that contrast beautifully with Agra Fort's imposing architecture. These green spaces invite contemplation of the site's rich historical and cultural significance.\n\nWalking through Diwan-i-Khas transports visitors to an era of imperial splendor. Its detailed craftsmanship and historical importance leave a lasting impression, providing a window into Shah Jahan's reign and the Mughal era's cultural heritage.\n\nDiwan-i-Khas transcends being merely an architectural wonder; it stands as a living monument to the artistry, diplomacy, and luxury of the Mughal Empire, an essential destination for history enthusiasts, architecture admirers, and anyone seeking connection with India's illustrious past."

You walk through these scalloped arches and suddenly you're in the 1600s, standing exactly where commoners once pleaded their cases before the mighty Mughal emperor.\n\nIt’s grand, yet grounded. Humble red sandstone pillars with royal symmetry. And that throne area? You can feel the weight of decisions once made there — love, justice, war, fate.\n\nPro tip: Stand in the center of the hall and clap. The acoustics still carry your voice like whispers of the past.\n\n📸 A must-click for architecture lovers, history nerds, and anyone who’s ever wanted to walk through a Netflix period drama set.\n\n#DiwanIAam #AgraFortChronicles #LostInHistory #MughalMajesty #EchoesOfThePast"

The marble dias below this chamber was known as 'Baithak'. It used to serve as the seat for Wazir, who presented petitions to the emperor.\nIt is said that the hall used to have silver balustrades for the nobility, where they could stand according to their ranks and the outlines of the columns and the spandrels were done in gold."

Named after Raja Amar Singh Rathore of Jodhpur, this gate played a crucial role in the fort's defense during the Mughal era.\n\nThe Amar Singh Gate is distinguished by its grand design and architectural splendor, exhibiting typical Mughal artistry with intricate carvings and majestic red sandstone facades. The gateway leads into a series of beautiful palaces, audience halls, and other important structures within the fort.\n\nOriginally, the fort had two main gates—the Delhi Gate and the Amar Singh Gate. While the Delhi Gate is largely reserved for military use, visitors today enter the fort through the Amar Singh Gate. Once inside, they can explore the vast complex that offers a glimpse into the opulence and strategic importance of the Mughal Empire."

So you cannot just go in anytime you please."

No good faculties - most of facilities are dumb and some don't want to do their job, only professor which I would like to appreciate is prof. Chikara who taught us physics and other one was MS YADAV in chemistry department. worst infrastructure - dirtiest washrooms you will ever see, even worser than railway general compartment. Worst management system - no one want to do their jobs.  No proper classes, worst quantity of class rooms- old and dusted and tooti- footi jung lagi hui benches. No proper lab. 3rd quality library facilities. No proper books, no proper reading hall. No placement cell.\n\nI had come here a very good student but bahar ekdum dumb nikla. Is college me 3 dal waste krne ke bad, I can realise today, how I wasted my precious time. Everything is in worst quality.\n\nAfter completing my graduation I have come to JNU to do masters in international relations. Despite cutoff funding by govt, this university is doing good in every field. In Agra College, I've seen only BJP events happening in auditorium but single events which can help students to grow.\n\nIn JNU you can see,  every day multiple events are going on. I'll request everyone to who is reading this review and thinking about to take admission in any college of Aga, first pls visit JNU once so you can realise what is mean by University,education, infrastructure and other things.\n\nIgnore my spellings and sentence mistakes. Ye sb is college me padne ki vajah se hua h. As a Hindi medium student."

The entry fee is kept at ₹50 for Indians (for garden only), but if you book it online by scanning the QR code then you will get some discount. The East Gate is the most convenient and organised gate to enter the Taj. Security protocols are at par with airports. The garden offers a mesmerising view of the grand monument. Photographers are available inside, who can shoot your photos in DSLR in various poses and give you the option to choose either soft copies or hard copies or both. The delivery time of photos is also unbelievably quick. The Taj can be cherished from different parts of the garden and each zone offers a different view. When the sun ☀️ rays fall on the Taj, if offers a heavenly sight to the spectators. Hence, sunrise & sunset are the best times to visit this place. Make sure to visit the Taj Museum too, which is situated in the garden premises and it doesn't cost extra. Highly recommended to visit this extraordinary UNESCO World Heritage site.🏩"

In the month of February every year, this garden is opened to the public. At that time, the garden is in its full bloom. Large numbers of men, women and children flock to the garden to have a glimpse of it. It, then becomes an important centre of attraction for the Delhi people.The garden is situated in the premises of the Rashtrapati Bhavan itself. There are high walls on all the sides of the garden. One cannot have a look at it from outside. The entry to the garden is from the North Avenue side. One has to pass through several check-outs before one actually steps into the garden. My father and I had the good luck of seeing it last year. We hired an auto and reached there."

Trees line the pathways, providing shade from the hot Indian sun, as well as fruits and fragrances to please the senses.\n\nThe garden at the Taj complex covers an area of 300 meters by 300 meters and is based on the geometric arrangement and symmetry. The trees of the garden are either Cyprus which signifies death or the fruit-bearing types which signify life and are perfectly arranged in symmetrical pattern.\n\nAt the crossing of the walkways in the centre of the garden is a raised platform (chabutra) of white marble with an ornamental pool (hauz) containing five fountains. Kanbo claimed eulogistically that it held the water of the celestial Kausar, the Propher's river in Paradise, which fills the pool at which believers bench their thirst on arrival.\n\nThe waterworks, which brought water to the Taj garden from the Yamuna by means of an aqueduct supported on arches, are situated outside its western wall and still preserve their original design. The inlet from the river is no longer visible\r."

One minute I was dodging the cheerful chaos of vendors, rickshaws, and marigold sellers, and the next, I had stepped through the small gateway that is now used to enter the Jama Masjid, and it was as if the world had hushed.\n\nThis isn't just any mosque. This is Jama Masjid of Agra — a 17th-century marvel commissioned by Jahanara Begum, the eldest daughter of Emperor Shah Jahan and his beloved Mumtaz Mahal. She wasn’t just a royal daughter — she was Padshah Begum, the First Lady of the Mughal Empire, a rare and powerful position for a woman of her time. And this mosque? It was her offering — to the people, to the faith, and to the city of her father’s legacy.\n\nThe structure is striking — built in red sandstone with intricate white marble inlay work that seems to dance in the sunlight. The five scalloped domes, the tall minarets (some damaged over time), and the richly carved pishtaqs (arched entrances) speak of an era when architecture was not just functional but poetic. Every arch seemed to hold a story, every latticework jaali filtered the light and the silence in perfect rhythm.\n\nAs I removed my shoes and covered my head, the atmosphere shifted palpably. Inside the courtyard, the noise of the market outside dissolved completely. There was peace here — not just the quiet kind, but a deeper, more rooted kind that comes from centuries of prayer, of feet walking the same sandstone tiles, of whispered faith echoing off domes.\n\nI watched people come and go — a young man quietly praying in one corner, an old couple sitting on the marble floor under the shade of a carved alcove, just soaking in the stillness. The mosque is still active, still alive with worship and memory. It felt like a place that had seen empires rise and fall, and yet remained, holding on to its quiet dignity.\n\nThe view at sunset was nothing short of magical. The red stone glows with a deep warmth, and the silhouette of the mosque’s domes against the softening sky is something I’ll carry in memory for a long time.\n\nWhat I also found heartwarming was how welcoming everyone was. A few locals smiled, nodded, offered directions, explained small historical details — no one rushed me or pushed me along. Respect the space — take off your shoes, keep your head covered, speak softly — and you'll be met with warmth and openness.\n\nIf you're visiting Agra, don’t just tick off the Taj Mahal and the Fort. Come here — to Jama Masjid."

The atmosphere here is peaceful and spiritual, especially during prayer times. Visitors are welcomed respectfully, though it’s important to dress modestly and maintain decorum.\n\nThe surrounding area is lively, with local vendors and street food adding to the cultural experience. Photography is allowed in most areas, and the view of the mosque against the sky is truly picturesque.\n\nOverall, Jama Masjid is a must-visit for history lovers, architecture enthusiasts, and anyone seeking a glimpse into India’s rich Mughal heritage. It’s a timeless symbol of faith, art, and history in the heart of Agra."

As one of the largest and most majestic mosques in India, it stands as a symbol of Islamic heritage, unity, and devotion.\n\nBuilt by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1656, this masjid is not just an architectural wonder but a place that fills your heart with peace and reminds you of the glory of Islam during the Mughal era. The grand courtyard, which can hold thousands of worshippers, becomes especially alive during Jumu'ah (Friday prayers) and Eid, creating a powerful sense of brotherhood and submission to Allah ﷻ."

It was evident from the current state of the mosque that it gets less attention than Delhi Jama Masjid. But to me, it is equally beautiful, the ambience of the area, the little kids reciting the holy Quran at one corner, the shade of mosque in the scorching heat of the sun gave me such relief! But the interior should be maintained properly, the prayer mats were full of dust, flies were everywhere.. The concerned authority can look into it."

He was right on point!\nWe began our tour of the Taj early in the morning with the sun rising after 6am, completed this after 9am, then we were able to return to our hotel within a few minutes to have a delicious Indian buffet breakfast, yummi!\nAfterwards, we set out to tour the Red Fort with Atiq, who graciously waited for us.\nI have to mention he also arranged for a nice car and a private driver for the whole day, we are very thankful for the arrangements he made in our behalf, they are much appreciated!\nIt’s really a marvel to see both the Taj Mahal and the Red Fort which was completed years before the Taj, he helped capture pics for us, good memories.  Spent the rest of the day touring the city, a bit of shopping, enjoying fresh fruit juice from the market and nice conversation.\nAtiq is a native of Agra, very knowledgeable of the area, it’s history and takes pride in the people and his family.\nIt was a pleasure being cared for like family, we really enjoyed our visit!"
