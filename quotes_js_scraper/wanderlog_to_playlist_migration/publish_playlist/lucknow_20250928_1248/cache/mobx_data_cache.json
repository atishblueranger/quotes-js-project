              "reviewText": "A place with picture worthy views but  mismanaged by authorities\n\nI was born in Lucknow, and I am a local.\nToday I visited the Imambara 3rd time in my life, last visit was in 2008 and these are the below things I observed.\n1. There is no  baggage or security check. This place is piece of cake for any one with bad intentions or wants to cause havoc.\n2. Ticket price for adults is INR 50 which is ok but for visiting the roof area or the bhool bhulaiyaa, a guide has to be hired which will cost minimum INR 100.\n3. Before entering the Imambara or the bhool bhulaiya everyone must deposit his/her shoes outside the inner Imambara entrance and the men at the deposit counter will say \"jo dena ho dede\" which means the price for security deposit is not fixed and they mostly keep shoes and slippers in open. If there is rain the shoes can get wet. There is no proper cloak room.\n4. Since taking guide is mandatory for bhool bhulaiya we had to forcefully do so and the guide will take you and show you the various holy things kept in Imambara. The guide that we got was named Raja Hindustani and his diction was not at all clear. He took us on the narrow paths made of the dome of the Imambara without footwear and there was no lights and the floor is broken at places and can cause cuts and bruises. The maintenance of this place is worst I have ever experienced. I will suggest not to take small kids here and that too on a weekend. My 4 year daughter was feeling scared and also this place is not for claustrophobic people.\n5. Our guide passed a comment too on my wife which she opposed and yelled at him after which our group consisting of 40 people praised and clapped for my wife as she vented out at the guide who all the group members were forced to follow even though his way of explaining things or tackling crowd was pathetic. Many women came and told my wife \" good you shouted at him \" as all of the people were frustrated but not speaking up against the unruly behaviour of the guide.\n6. Since the roof is all stones and everywhere it is hard and uneven , walking on it for kids is very hard and chances of getting hurt are high.\n7. Nevertheless it is a picturesque place and if you hire a proper guide who takes more money your experience can be better but the forced guide system and no light being in the narrow pathways is risky for women.\nThe forced guide will charge INR 150 for complete tour.\n8. Now my next visit maybe after next 15 16 years and if given a chance may not visit at all.\nI love Lucknow for the food and culture but at present taking some outsider to this place may only cause you embarrassment. They should install lights in dark pathways and remove the mandate of removing shoes on the roof of the building as it causes huge discomfort to tourists. The renovation from outside makes the building look pretty."

I got the opportunity to visit this place and its entry ticket gives you access to visit other nearby iconic destinations too, like Chota Imambara, Shahi Bauli, Bhool Bhulaiya etc. In the Bada Imambara you are required to deposit your shoes in the shoe counter before entering its many impressive sections. One important point to note is that they don't allow unmarried couples to enter Bhool Bhulaiya without hiring a guide.\nOverall, it's a spectacular place to visit in Lucknow!💫"

              "reviewText": "Of course! Here is a glowing, detailed review of the Bara Imambara in Lucknow, written from the perspective of a captivated visitor.\n\n---\n\nA Masterpiece of Architecture and Emotion: The Bara Imambara is Unmissable\n\n★★★★★ A Spellbinding Journey into Lucknow's Soul\n\nIf there is one place that captures the grandeur, the melancholy, and the ingenious spirit of Old Lucknow, it is the Bara Imambara. My visit here was not just a tick on a tourist checklist; it was a profound and moving experience that stayed with me long after I left.\n\nWhat Makes it Breathtaking:\n\n· Architectural Marvel: Built in the 18th century by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula as a famine relief project, this isn't just a building; it's a statement. The central hall, the Bhul-Bhulaiya, is the undisputed star. It’s the world's largest unsupported vaulted chamber—a fact that becomes awe-inspiring once you stand under its colossal, gravity-defying ceiling. The absence of any beams or pillars is an engineering miracle that will leave you staring upwards in wonder.\n· The Labyrinth (Bhul-Bhulaiya): This is an adventure like no other! The complex network of over 1000 narrow passageways, stairways, and dead ends across three floors is brilliantly confusing. A guide is highly recommended—not just to find your way out, but to hear the fascinating stories of secret tunnels (some leading to Delhi, Allahabad, and even the river Gomti!), acoustic tricks where a whisper travels from one end to the other, and the strategic purpose this maze served. It’s incredibly fun and a little thrilling!\n· The Grand Scale and Symmetry: The entire complex is a lesson in grandeur. From the majestic Baoli (stepwell) with its hauntingly beautiful reflection in the water to the towering Rumi Darwaza (a few steps away, often considered a part of the complex), every structure is built on an epic scale. The symmetry of the main Imambara, reflected in the large water tank in front of it, makes for stunning photographs.\n· A Place of Peace and Spirit: Despite the crowds, there are corners of serene tranquility. The main hall is a sacred Shia Muslim congregation space, especially during Muharram. The atmosphere is one of deep respect and peace. The views from the top of the labyrinth, overlooking the old city of Lucknow, are simply priceless.\n\nA Few Tips for Your Visit:\n\n· Hire a Guide: Seriously, do it. They are available at the entrance and for a reasonable fee, they bring the history and secrets of the Imambara to life. The stories and facts they share are invaluable.\n· Wear Comfortable Shoes: You will be climbing a lot of stairs, especially in the Bhul-Bhulaiya.\n· Best Time to Visit: Early morning or late afternoon to avoid the peak heat and crowds. The golden hour light makes the sandstone glow beautifully.\n· Combine Your Visit: The beautiful Chota Imambara and the British Residency are nearby and together they complete the story of historic Lucknow.\n\nIn Conclusion:\n\nThe Bara Imambara is more than stone and mortar. It is a testament to human compassion (built for a famine relief), architectural genius, and the rich cultural tapestry of Lucknow. It engages you physically, intellectually, and emotionally. It is, without a doubt, the heart and soul of the city and an absolute must-visit for anyone traveling to India.\n\nYou don't just see the Bara Imambara; you feel it. And that feeling is unforgettable."

The huge central hall, built without the support of beams, felt both overwhelming and mesmerizing. Every corner had a story hidden in its arches, walls, and intricate designs.\nThe Bhool Bhulaiya was one of the most fascinating parts. Walking through the narrow passageways, turning corners, and finding hidden staircases felt adventurous—almost like being transported into another era. It was both thrilling and slightly mysterious, knowing that people hundreds of years ago had walked the same paths. After weaving through its narrow corridors and hidden stairways, I reached the terrace. The moment I looked out from the jharokha, I was left speechless—the view was simply breathtaking.Seeing the gardens, the minarets, and the cityscape framed in heritage architecture made me realize why this monument is considered the pride of Lucknow.\nThe whole experience was more than just sightseeing—it was about feeling the Nawabi charm, the artistry, and the timelessness of a place that still stands tall after centuries. Bara Imambara isn’t just a monument, it’s a reminder of how beautifully history and culture live on in the heart of Lucknow. 🌿✨"

Built in 1784 by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula during a period of severe famine, the structure not only provided employment to thousands but also left behind a masterpiece that continues to awe visitors centuries later. Often referred to as the “Turkish Gate” due to its Awadhi architectural style inspired by Turkish design, the Rumi Darwaza rises to a height of 60 feet, with a striking arched gateway and intricately carved floral motifs adorning its surface.\n\nSadly, in recent years, the monument has undergone a round of repainting rather than proper restoration. The use of modern paints, rather than historically accurate conservation techniques, has slightly dulled its original charm. Yet, even this cosmetic intervention hasn’t managed to mask its beauty. The gateway still exudes elegance and grandeur.\n\nWhat makes Rumi Darwaza even more intriguing is its resemblance to the shape of a traditional necklace — and to those familiar with Lucknow’s textile artistry, it uncannily echoes the layout of a chikan kurta design. It’s a bridge between architecture and culture, the physical and the artistic. Despite changes over time, Rumi Darwaza continues to be a proud emblem of Lucknow’s past and present."

A must-visit spot that reflects the royal past of Lucknow."

I went there on a quiet afternoon, and the moment I entered, I felt like I had just time-travelled back into history. The structure is in ruins but still looks so beautiful and grand – you can imagine how royal it must’ve been back in the day.\n\nThe place is super peaceful, barely any crowd, and surrounded by greenery. I just walked around slowly, soaking in the old architecture and taking some cool photos – perfect spot for anyone who loves historic vibes. And the best part is, it’s not commercialized or noisy like other places. Just calm, raw, and real.\n\nIf you ever want a chill place to explore that also connects you with Lucknow's past, then this is the spot. Pure peaceful vibe and a solid escape from the city chaos."

This historic baroque mansion which saw great action during the 1857 revolution period should be a must on everyone's calendar. Site facilities are however non existent. Drinking water fountains do not work and the main information centre and souvenir shop is now a glorious outhouse for staff. The lawns are reasonably well maintained and inner courtyards of both structures remain locked without explanation. Old signs of vandalism and brainless love scribbles exist as a reminder that a lot of people don't value Heritage.\n\nGripes apart, this is a must visit and barely a 10 mins ride from City centre. This hunting lodge cum Summer retreat for the nawabs and British residents alike would have been a vibrant place in the early 19th century. Hopefully the tourism development corporation would better publicize this place and allot a decent budget for better upkeep and maintenance.\n\nEntry is free from sunrise till sunset but you may find the main gate locked till 10 am. Even otherwise, the gate was perplexingly locked with a loose chain which makes visitors squeeze through the gates. Parking is amply available on site for two and four wheelers."

              "reviewText": "In the resplendent city of Lucknow, a towering marvel of modernity pierces the sky – the illustrious Clock Tower, a masterpiece of Moorish design, erstwhile believed to be the largest in the Indian subcontinent. This magnificent edifice, a symphony of stone and steel, is illuminated by a dazzling array of lamps, its beauty further enhanced by the melodic chime of five bells, whose sweet peals echo through the air. Standing tall at 221 feet, this grandiose structure is an exemplar of traditional British architecture, rivaling the iconic Big Ben of London in both splendor and majesty. Its colossal wheels, a marvel of engineering, surpass even those of its London counterpart.\n\nConceived by the visionary architect of those times- Richard Roskell Bayne, this monumental clock tower was erected at a cost of two lakhs, funded by the benevolent Trustees of the Husainabad Endowment, who wisely invested the legacy of thirty-six lakhs of rupees bequeathed by the illustrious Muhammad Ali Shah, third King of Oudh. Bayne’s masterpiece, a testament to his ingenuity, boasts a intricate machinery comprising wrought-iron sides, gun-metal wheels, and hardened steel pinions, precision-crafted to ensure unwavering accuracy.\n\nThis majestic timepiece, a true marvel of modern science, stands as a shining beacon, a testament to the confluence of art and engineering. Its grandeur is a reflection of Bayne’s prolific career, which spanned the construction of bridges, train stations, and bungalows, as well as monumental buildings such as the East India Railway Office, New Market in Kolkata, and Oak Grove School in Mussoorie. His legacy extends to the Thornhill and Mayne Memorial Library and Mayo Memorial in Allahabad, a testament to his enduring impact on India’s architectural landscape."

The architecture is absolutely stunning, with grand arches, intricate carvings, and a beautifully maintained garden that adds to the charm of the place. It’s not just a monument — it feels like stepping back in time. The central hall is massive and awe-inspiring, and the Bhulbhulaiya (labyrinth) is a must-try for a bit of fun and mystery. It’s a peaceful, clean, and well-kept heritage site, perfect for history lovers, photographers, or anyone wanting a glimpse of Lucknow’s royal past. Highly recommended if you’re visiting the city!"

The service is quick and the staff tries their best, but the crowd is massive — and for good reason! With such iconic food, managing everything perfectly is a challenge, but they still deliver a great experience.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who loves authentic Mughlai flavors.

The rest of the household and kitchen items can be found at a very good price if you know how to bargain.\nTake care of your valuables like phones and jewellery or leave them at home.

I was greeted by the vibrant stalls selling handicrafts, carpets, and so much more. It felt like a mini-India, with representatives from almost every state showcasing their unique culture.\n\nI'm a sucker for swings, and the ones here were amazing - I felt like a kid again! The food stalls were also a delight, with the aroma of kebabs and biryani wafting through the air.\n\nWhat I loved most was the tribute to the nawabs and Atal Vihari Vajpayee - it's clear that Lucknow is proud of its heritage. And the ghazal performances in the evening? Mesmerizing! This place is also good for morning walks.\n\nIf you're looking for a taste of India's diversity and richness, Lucknow Mahotsav Sthal is a must-visit. Don't miss it, folks!"

This huge park is spread over a few acres and is well planned with walking and jogging tracks, plenty of benches for sitting, greenery all over, and even a few peacocks!\nI visit this park daily for morning walks, and one round of the park is about 3300 steps. It's the perfect place for morning and evening walks, exercise, and you can even play badminton too.\n\nWhat I love about this park is the peaceful atmosphere and the feeling of being surrounded by nature. The park is well-maintained, and the greenery is a treat for the eyes. The peacocks add to the charm of the place, and it's always a joy to see them strutting around.\n\nOne thing that could be improved is the availability of drinking water facilities. While there are a few water fountains, they are not enough for the size of the park.\n\nOverall, Lucknow Mohatsav Sthal is a wonderful place to spend some time outdoors and get some exercise. With its well-planned tracks, greenery, and peacocks, it's definitely worth a visit. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a peaceful and refreshing break from the city's hustle and bustle. Therefore, I would give it a four-star rating."

Atal Behari Vajpayee ji.What people loved most was Atal Village, a model of village built with care to introduce youngsters who had never been to a Village.It had various stalls too selling village products plus it was the venue for Bal Mahotsava ,whose various programs entertained visitors in the afternoon.The main Mahotsava Hall had Youth Mahotsava programs in the day and cultural programs in the evening. Marijuana had varied shops selling crockery, clothes and carved wood and stone stuff, both handicrafts and machine made. Food Court saw people savouring wide variety of foods like Rajasthani cuisine,Punjabi Cuisine and of course Nawabi Lucknow cuisine.Rajasthani dance troupe entertained as well as a family showing puppet show. A gallery was solely dedicated to the memory of Atal ji in pictures and video. R.B.I. stall saw many visitors for exchanging currency.Various exciting Joyrides were the next popular destination for visitors.Stalls and attractions were so many that you needed at least two full days. Kashmiri stalls also drew lots of crowds for warm stoles, shawls etc.  and also for genuine dry fruits from the valley. Management and security was really good and cleanliness was great too, wheelchairs were available too. People had a wonderful time with family here and eventually it was extended by The Governor till this Sunday. On Sunday it was the day of cheap deals at throwaway prices and crowd surge was excellent and stall owners sold a lot and were happy too to bid adieu to the Lucknow Mahotsava until next year."

Built in 1784 by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula during a period of severe famine, the structure not only provided employment to thousands but also left behind a masterpiece that continues to awe visitors centuries later. Often referred to as the “Turkish Gate” due to its Awadhi architectural style inspired by Turkish design, the Rumi Darwaza rises to a height of 60 feet, with a striking arched gateway and intricately carved floral motifs adorning its surface.\n\nSadly, in recent years, the monument has undergone a round of repainting rather than proper restoration. The use of modern paints, rather than historically accurate conservation techniques, has slightly dulled its original charm. Yet, even this cosmetic intervention hasn’t managed to mask its beauty. The gateway still exudes elegance and grandeur.\n\nWhat makes Rumi Darwaza even more intriguing is its resemblance to the shape of a traditional necklace — and to those familiar with Lucknow’s textile artistry, it uncannily echoes the layout of a chikan kurta design. It’s a bridge between architecture and culture, the physical and the artistic. Despite changes over time, Rumi Darwaza continues to be a proud emblem of Lucknow’s past and present."

Built in 1784 by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, it's a fine example of Awadhi architecture and once marked the gateway to the city. Mr Ikhlaq and his friends shared the historical significance, adding depth to the experience. The view during sunset was beautiful and peaceful, and the energy around the place was vibrant. A must-visit spot that reflects the royal past of Lucknow."

              "reviewText": "A place with picture worthy views but  mismanaged by authorities\n\nI was born in Lucknow, and I am a local.\nToday I visited the Imambara 3rd time in my life, last visit was in 2008 and these are the below things I observed.\n1. There is no  baggage or security check. This place is piece of cake for any one with bad intentions or wants to cause havoc.\n2. Ticket price for adults is INR 50 which is ok but for visiting the roof area or the bhool bhulaiyaa, a guide has to be hired which will cost minimum INR 100.\n3. Before entering the Imambara or the bhool bhulaiya everyone must deposit his/her shoes outside the inner Imambara entrance and the men at the deposit counter will say \"jo dena ho dede\" which means the price for security deposit is not fixed and they mostly keep shoes and slippers in open. If there is rain the shoes can get wet. There is no proper cloak room.\n4. Since taking guide is mandatory for bhool bhulaiya we had to forcefully do so and the guide will take you and show you the various holy things kept in Imambara. The guide that we got was named Raja Hindustani and his diction was not at all clear. He took us on the narrow paths made of the dome of the Imambara without footwear and there was no lights and the floor is broken at places and can cause cuts and bruises. The maintenance of this place is worst I have ever experienced. I will suggest not to take small kids here and that too on a weekend. My 4 year daughter was feeling scared and also this place is not for claustrophobic people.\n5. Our guide passed a comment too on my wife which she opposed and yelled at him after which our group consisting of 40 people praised and clapped for my wife as she vented out at the guide who all the group members were forced to follow even though his way of explaining things or tackling crowd was pathetic. Many women came and told my wife \" good you shouted at him \" as all of the people were frustrated but not speaking up against the unruly behaviour of the guide.\n6. Since the roof is all stones and everywhere it is hard and uneven , walking on it for kids is very hard and chances of getting hurt are high.\n7. Nevertheless it is a picturesque place and if you hire a proper guide who takes more money your experience can be better but the forced guide system and no light being in the narrow pathways is risky for women.\nThe forced guide will charge INR 150 for complete tour.\n8. Now my next visit maybe after next 15 16 years and if given a chance may not visit at all.\nI love Lucknow for the food and culture but at present taking some outsider to this place may only cause you embarrassment. They should install lights in dark pathways and remove the mandate of removing shoes on the roof of the building as it causes huge discomfort to tourists. The renovation from outside makes the building look pretty."

One important point to note is that they don't allow unmarried couples to enter Bhool Bhulaiya without hiring a guide.\nOverall, it's a spectacular place to visit in Lucknow!💫"

Built in 1784 by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, this grand complex reflects the elegance of Mughal and Awadhi architecture, constructed without the use of wood or iron.\n\nThe highlight of the monument is the Bhulbhulaiya (labyrinth) – a fascinating maze of narrow passages, countless identical doorways, and hidden staircases. Exploring it is both exciting and slightly mysterious, and it’s easy to lose your way without a guide. Hiring a local guide is strongly recommended, as they not only help you navigate the maze but also share interesting historical stories about the Imambada.\n\nAnother marvel is the central arched hall, one of the largest in the world without any supporting beams. Standing inside feels majestic and showcases the genius of 18th-century engineering. The complex also includes the Asfi Mosque and the Shahi Baoli (stepwell), each worth visiting for their design and historical significance.\n\nThe site is generally well maintained, with reasonable entry fees, and combined tickets give access to all attractions inside. Weekends and holidays can be crowded, so mornings are the best time to visit. Parking is available outside, and after exploring, you can enjoy authentic Lucknowi food at nearby eateries.\n\nOverall, Bara Imambada along with the famous Bhulbhulaiya is an unforgettable experience – a mix of history, culture, and architectural brilliance. A true jewel of Lucknow!"

You can either go for a run, walk or simply spend some time with friends and families together.\n\nThere is also a child's playground and an excercise activity equipment for adults.\n\nWe saw a handful of people running while others walking to excercise their cardio.\n\nNear Gate 1 on the right there is a coffee kiosk with some breakfast bread if you want to sit and enjoy some cuppa.\n\nThere are also security guards present. I did not see any dogs inside except outside. This place is clean and very quiet until you are close to the road especially when you turn left from gate 1.\n\nThis place can become a healthy ritual or habbit for your well-being.\n\nI found 3 toilet blocks but there could be more for your convenience.\n\nWe did not have to pay for an entry."

Some young couple was there on a corner finding some pleasure time to check each other ha ha..!! No guide, no human beings from ASI at all. You can roam around, read about the building in Wikipedia and just study the site on your own. Nice place to visit. Clean and neat. No crowd. Open on all working days. Just enter though the gap of closed gates. (Gates won't be opened normally, it's always kept closed. But you can get in through the gaps). Read about the monument and visit the area. That will help you enjoy your visit."

The Palace, with its unique blend of British Architecture and French Design, was built specifically for the Nawabs of Lucknow. Originally, it served as a temporary residence for the Nawabs when they went hunting, offering them a peaceful place surrounded with natural beauty.\nBeyond its Architectural beauty, the Palace also holds significant historical importance. It was destroyed during the First War of Independence in 1857, marking it as a site with a deep connection to India's struggle for freedom.\nThis palace is not just a piece of history but also a peaceful escape from the bustling city life. It's a must visit destination that offers a perfect blend of history, architecture, nature and a glimpse of the royal lifestyle of the Nawabs of Lucknow."

              "reviewText": "Sikandar Bagh is a historic garden complex located in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, noted for its rich cultural significance and architectural grandeur. It was built in the mid-19th century by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, as a summer residence and a tribute to his beloved wife, Sikandar Mahal Begum. The garden’s name literally means \"Garden of Sikandar,\" and it was intended as a private retreat and a cultural hub for the Nawab’s court.\n\nSpanning approximately four and a half acres, Sikandar Bagh was designed as a fortified enclosure with high walls made from Lakhauri bricks, featuring intricate plaster moldings. Initially, the complex included a summer palace, a mosque, and a wooden pavilion intended for cultural performances such as Ras-Lila (a traditional dramatic enactment of Krishna’s life), Kathak dance recitals, music concerts, and poetic gatherings. The garden was renowned for its serene beauty, shaded by tall trees and dotted with fountains, offering a peaceful environment for relaxation and artistic expression.\n\nArchitecturally, Sikandar Bagh is an exceptional blend of Indian, Persian, European, and Chinese styles. The gateway that still stands today is a splendid example, adorned with intricate frescoes that resemble Lucknow’s famous Chikan embroidery. The decorations on the walls and domes include floral motifs and peacock iconography, reflecting a cultural fusion that embodied the Nawabi era's cosmopolitan tastes. The gateway's arches, pediments, chhatris (domed pavilions), and pillars exhibit this blend beautifully, echoing the artistic sophistication of the time.\n\nHowever, the serene ambiance of Sikandar Bagh was dramatically shattered in 1857 during the Indian Rebellion (also known as the First War of Independence). Sikandar Bagh became a stronghold for Indian sepoys opposing British colonial rule. The fortress-like garden witnessed fierce battles in November 1857 when British forces under Sir Colin Campbell launched a brutal assault to reclaim control. Over 2,000 sepoy freedom fighters were killed during this assault, and the site became infamous for the slaughter that ensued within its walls. The walls still bear the scars of this violent conflict, and skeletal remains were photographed by early war correspondents, marking Sikandar Bagh as a site of immense historical trauma.\n\nFollowing the rebellion, the British used the site for their military purposes briefly before it was left largely in ruins. Today, Sikandar Bagh stands as a poignant monument, embodying both the artistic heritage of the Nawabs and the brutal realities of colonial conquest. The garden has been preserved by the Archaeological Survey of India and is now part of the National Botanical Research Institute campus.\n\nVisitors today can admire the surviving gateway, which serves as a vivid reminder of Lucknow’s rich past, from its cultural zenith under Nawabi patronage to its central role in the struggle against colonial rule. The garden itself remains a tranquil retreat in the midst of a bustling city, with its shaded area providing a quiet escape for morning walkers, families, and history enthusiasts.\nSikandar Bagh is a magnificent cultural and historical landmark of Lucknow. Built as a garden palace by Nawab Wajid Ali Shah in honor of his wife, it reflects a unique confluence of architectural styles and was once a vibrant space for the performing arts. It became a symbol of resistance during the 1857 revolt, witnessing intense fighting and bloodshed. Today, preserved as a heritage site, it stands as a solemn tribute to both the artistic heritage and the sacrifices of those who fought for India’s freedom.\n👍👍👍👍🤗🤗🤗🤗💯💯💯💯💯"

              "reviewText": "It is a beautiful place in the heart of Lucknow,and a place of great historical importance. It was built by the last Nawab of Oudh, Wajid Ali Shah, after his favourite wife, Sikandar Mahal. It was built as a summer residence with a garden inside. During the rebellion of 1857, the Indian revolutionaries made this place one of their strongholds during the long siege of British Residency of Lucknow. The British troops stormed this place in November 1857 and this place witnessed hand to hand combat and the slaughter of all the 2200 Indian revolutionaries who were holed up in this place during the siege! It is now a protected place.\nThe ambience is blissful."

Recently, I finally took the time to revisit this historic gem — and I’m so glad I did.\n\nThe moment you step inside, you’re transported to a time that shaped India’s history. The ruins, still marked with bullet holes and cannon fire, silently narrate the intensity of the 1857 revolt. Each structure within the complex — from the Baillie Guard Gate and Treasury to the church ruins and underground chambers — holds a haunting charm.\n\nWalking through the wide lawns and shaded pathways, I spent time at the museum, the graveyard, and the many crumbling buildings that once formed the heart of British residency life. The view from the top of some of the structures is breathtaking, and the atmosphere is both peaceful and reflective.\n\nIt’s not just a monument, it’s a memory — of resilience, history, and a city that has seen so much. If you’re in Lucknow, The Residency deserves your time and attention."

You can even purchase from here small guide cum history books on Konark, Goa, Delhi etc. which are limited edition publications of ASI and is not available in the market. Definitely residency is worth a visit if you are a history buff or want a peaceful place to stroll and sit, away from the hustle and bustle of the city."

It’s especially beautiful during the evening when the lights come on, creating a magical atmosphere.\n\nThe place does get quite crowded, especially on weekends and evenings, but it’s still worth a visit if you’re nearby. It’s a great spot for photography and for anyone who appreciates heritage sites. I hope the authorities continue preserving and promoting this underrated gem of Lucknow."

              "reviewText": "Recently visited Satkhanda, and it turned out to be one of the most captivating experiences in Lucknow. Nestled near the iconic Chota Imambara, this unfinished four-storey tower — originally intended to be a seven-storey marvel — stands as a quiet testament to Nawabi-era ambition and architectural beauty.\n\nI was fortunate to be allowed inside the building and went right up to the top — and let me just say, the view from up there was absolutely exotic. Overlooking the heart of old Lucknow, the panorama is breathtaking, especially as the sun begins to set.\n\nWith its unique blend of Mughal and Italian influences, Satkhanda is both historically intriguing and visually stunning. Though not as widely known as other monuments in the city, it’s a place that truly rewards those who seek it out.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who enjoys history, architecture, or simply wants to experience the regal calm and charm of old Lucknow from a rare vantage point."

              "reviewText": "Located in the historic Hussainabad area of Lucknow, Satkhanda is a unique and intriguing monument. Situated near other popular landmarks like the Chota Imambara, it stands as a testament to the city's rich architectural past and the vision of its rulers.\n​The word \"Satkhanda\" literally means \"seven-storied,\" a name that hints at its unfulfilled ambition. It was commissioned by Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah to be a magnificent seven story watchtower, but its construction was tragically halted after his untimely death. This abrupt ending has made it a symbol of both ambition and a touch of melancholy.\n​Architecturally, the tower is a fascinating blend of Mughal, Greek, and French styles. Made of red bricks, its most distinctive feature is its tapering design, where each of the four completed stories is smaller than the one below it. This gives it an appearance reminiscent of the famous Leaning Tower of Pisa.\n​Today, Satkhanda remains an unfinished masterpiece. While it may not have reached its intended height, its unique story and striking design make it a popular spot for visitors and photographers. It stands as a powerful reminder of Lucknow's regal history and the captivating tales that lie behind its heritage structures."

              "reviewText": "Satkhanda in Lucknow is a must-visit historical landmark that beautifully showcases the city's rich cultural heritage. Located near the Bara Imambara, this incomplete seven-story tower offers a glimpse into the past with its architectural elegance and intriguing history.\n\nThe tower was built during the reign of Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula in the 18th century but was never fully completed, which adds an air of mystery to its presence. The structure is a fine example of Mughal and Awadhi architecture, with intricate carvings and detailed work that reflect the artistic excellence of that era.\n\nWhile the tower may not offer a panoramic view from its top due to its unfinished state, the view from the lower levels is still impressive. The location is relatively quiet, making it a good spot for those who enjoy a peaceful walk while soaking in the local history.\n\nWhat makes Satkhanda stand out is its historical significance. It was once intended to rival other monumental structures in the region, and it tells a unique story of ambition and unfinished dreams. Visitors can enjoy the peaceful surroundings and learn more about Lucknow's Nawabi era and its grandeur.\n\nOverall, Satkhanda is an interesting and charming spot for history buffs, architecture lovers, and anyone keen on exploring the lesser-known facets of Lucknow’s history."

I went there on a quiet afternoon, and the moment I entered, I felt like I had just time-travelled back into history. The structure is in ruins but still looks so beautiful and grand – you can imagine how royal it must’ve been back in the day.\n\nThe place is super peaceful, barely any crowd, and surrounded by greenery. I just walked around slowly, soaking in the old architecture and taking some cool photos – perfect spot for anyone who loves historic vibes. And the best part is, it’s not commercialized or noisy like other places. Just calm, raw, and real.\n\nIf you ever want a chill place to explore that also connects you with Lucknow's past, then this is the spot. Pure peaceful vibe and a solid escape from the city chaos."

              "reviewText": "An often ignored rarely visited Heritage spot in Lucknow. Most tourists head to Imam Bara, Roomi Darwaza, top off with kebabs and leave. This historic baroque mansion which saw great action during the 1857 revolution period should be a must on everyone's calendar. Site facilities are however non existent. Drinking water fountains do not work and the main information centre and souvenir shop is now a glorious outhouse for staff. The lawns are reasonably well maintained and inner courtyards of both structures remain locked without explanation. Old signs of vandalism and brainless love scribbles exist as a reminder that a lot of people don't value Heritage.\n\nGripes apart, this is a must visit and barely a 10 mins ride from City centre. This hunting lodge cum Summer retreat for the nawabs and British residents alike would have been a vibrant place in the early 19th century. Hopefully the tourism development corporation would better publicize this place and allot a decent budget for better upkeep and maintenance.\n\nEntry is free from sunrise till sunset but you may find the main gate locked till 10 am. Even otherwise, the gate was perplexingly locked with a loose chain which makes visitors squeeze through the gates. Parking is amply available on site for two and four wheelers."

              "reviewText": "In the resplendent city of Lucknow, a towering marvel of modernity pierces the sky – the illustrious Clock Tower, a masterpiece of Moorish design, erstwhile believed to be the largest in the Indian subcontinent. This magnificent edifice, a symphony of stone and steel, is illuminated by a dazzling array of lamps, its beauty further enhanced by the melodic chime of five bells, whose sweet peals echo through the air. Standing tall at 221 feet, this grandiose structure is an exemplar of traditional British architecture, rivaling the iconic Big Ben of London in both splendor and majesty. Its colossal wheels, a marvel of engineering, surpass even those of its London counterpart.\n\nConceived by the visionary architect of those times- Richard Roskell Bayne, this monumental clock tower was erected at a cost of two lakhs, funded by the benevolent Trustees of the Husainabad Endowment, who wisely invested the legacy of thirty-six lakhs of rupees bequeathed by the illustrious Muhammad Ali Shah, third King of Oudh. Bayne’s masterpiece, a testament to his ingenuity, boasts a intricate machinery comprising wrought-iron sides, gun-metal wheels, and hardened steel pinions, precision-crafted to ensure unwavering accuracy.\n\nThis majestic timepiece, a true marvel of modern science, stands as a shining beacon, a testament to the confluence of art and engineering. Its grandeur is a reflection of Bayne’s prolific career, which spanned the construction of bridges, train stations, and bungalows, as well as monumental buildings such as the East India Railway Office, New Market in Kolkata, and Oak Grove School in Mussoorie. His legacy extends to the Thornhill and Mayne Memorial Library and Mayo Memorial in Allahabad, a testament to his enduring impact on India’s architectural landscape."

It’s a peaceful, clean, and well-kept heritage site, perfect for history lovers, photographers, or anyone wanting a glimpse of Lucknow’s royal past. Highly recommended if you’re visiting the city!"

The place is massive, clean, and beautifully built with stunning red sandstone and grand statues all around. The architecture is just wow – it really gives a royal and powerful vibe. The elephant statues and the central stupa are especially impressive.\n\nI loved how peaceful it felt walking around, and the way it honors Dr. B. R. Ambedkar and other reformers is truly respectful and inspiring. It's a great place for both history lovers and anyone who enjoys calm, open spaces.\n\nOnly reason I’m not giving it a full 5 is because it can get really hot during the day – especially with all the stone everywhere. Best to go early morning or late evening.\n\nDefinitely worth visiting if you're in Lucknow!"

It's acres of land barren, covered in marble tiles, lot of real sized marble elephants, 2-3 waterfalls, around marble land, uncountable lights in the evening.\nDon't understand the point of utilizing so much land for this, could have grown  some trees atleast, play area for kids, resting area for senior citizens.\nIt's not a place you would visit after once. Total waste of money of tax payers.\nPros park is very  beautiful with lot of monuments and huge area . Sunset looks very beautiful ticket is nominal just 20 rs . Perfect place for photography . Meditation centre."

The architecture is grand and the entire area is very clean and well-maintained. Evening time is the best to visit when the lights are on – the monuments look absolutely stunning and the whole place feels very peaceful.\n\nIt is a great spot for families, couples, and even groups of friends. There is a large open area and playground available, so children also enjoy their time here. The walking paths and stone structures make it perfect for photography and spending quality time.\n\nThe only thing to keep in mind is that it gets a bit crowded during weekends and public holidays, so for a calm experience weekdays are better.\n\n⭐ Overall, this memorial is not just a tourist attraction but also a place of pride for Lucknow. A must-visit if you are in the city."

The lighting along the river makes it look magical after sunset. Whether you're into morning walks, photography, or just want to sit by the water and relax, this place is perfect. Great spot to chill with friends or even go for a solo stroll. Highly recommend visiting at dusk!"

It has made the Gomti River a place people can enjoy again.\nImagine a peaceful break from the busy city. That is what the riverfront offers. You can relax, feel refreshed, and be close to nature by the Gomti River.\nThere is plenty to do there. You can walk or bike on paths, sit in gardens, play in recreational areas, and grab a bite from food stalls. Plus, they've got restrooms and parking.\nThe only real problem is the river itself. Sometimes, a bad smell comes and goes, which can be unpleasant. But, when it's not smelly, it is a great place to unwind and spend some good time. The park was almost empty during our visit probably because of the smell. Gomti Riverfront Park has toilets, but only at the parking site. There are no toilets within the park itself. The best time  for the tourists to visit it is in the evening with lit up colourful lights. Nice place to relax and enjoy."

Lined with beautifully landscaped gardens, wide jogging paths, musical fountains, and scenic views of the river, it’s perfect for morning walks, evening strolls, yoga, and quiet reflection. The entire area is very clean, well-lit, and carefully maintained, making it a safe and welcoming environment for families, children, fitness lovers, and photographers. Whether you’re visiting solo or with loved ones, the tranquil atmosphere and cool river breeze offer a refreshing break from the chaos of daily life.\n\nJust a few minutes away lies 1090 Chauraha—a completely different but equally fascinating urban hotspot. Known not only for its connection with the UP Women Power Line, it has evolved into a youth magnet. In the evenings, it comes alive with college students, local skaters, joggers, influencers filming content, and people simply catching up over tea and street snacks. Despite being a public space, it feels secure and organized. The open layout, decorative lighting, and wide sidewalks make it perfect for casual hangouts, open-air discussions, or simply enjoying the street buzz.\n\nTogether, Gomti Riverfront and 1090 Chauraha reflect the soul of a new, progressive Lucknow—one side offers inner peace, while the other celebrates public energy. Both are must-visits for anyone looking to experience the contrasting yet connected moods of the city."

Stepping into this cultural hub felt like taking a journey through time, and I couldn't have been more impressed with the vast array of artifacts and exhibits on display.\n\nThe Archaeological Gallery is a treasure trove of ancient wonders. From intricately carved sculptures to exquisite pottery, every artifact tells a story of Lucknow's rich history and civilization. Walking through this gallery felt like unraveling the mysteries of the past, and I was captivated by the sheer beauty and craftsmanship of each piece.\n\nThe Mummy Gallery was a fascinating experience unlike any other. Seeing the remarkably preserved mummies up close was both eerie and awe-inspiring. The museum did an excellent job of providing informative insights into ancient Egyptian culture and burial practices, making the experience educational and memorable.\n\nWhat struck me the most about my visit to the State Museum was the overwhelming sense of positiveness it instilled in me. Despite being surrounded by artifacts from centuries ago, there was an undeniable feeling of connection and appreciation for the past. It was a reminder of how far we've come as a society and the importance of preserving our cultural heritage for future generations.\n\nI highly recommend visiting the State Museum in Lucknow to anyone interested in history, archaeology, or simply looking to gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. It's a truly enriching experience that will leave you feeling inspired and enlightened."

              "reviewText": "A Roaring Good Time for the Whole Family!\n\nI recently visited the Nawab Wajid Ali Shah lucknow Zoo, and i had an absolute blast!\nAs i walked through the gates, we were immediately struck by the sheer variety of animals on display. From majestic lions and tigers to playful monkeys, there's something for everyone at this fantastic zoo.\n\nWhat truly impressed me, however, was the zoo's commitment to animal welfare and conservation. The enclosures are spacious and well-maintained, providing the animals with a safe and healthy environment.\n\nWhile the zoo is generally well-maintained, there are a few areas where it could improve. For example, some of the signage could be clearer, and the food options could be more varied.\nOverall, I would highly recommend the Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoo to anyone looking for a fun and educational day out. With its incredible variety of animals, spacious enclosures, and family-friendly atmosphere, it's a must-visit destination for anyone in Lucknow!\n\nStandout Features:\nVariety of Animals: The zoo is home to over 1,000 animals from around the world, including some rare and endangered species.\n\nSpacious Enclosures: The zoo's commitment to animal welfare is evident in the spacious and well-maintained enclosures.\n\nFamily-Friendly: The zoo offers a range of activities and attractions for kids, making it a great destination for families.\n\nTips and Insights:\nBest Time to Visit: Early morning or late afternoon, when the sun isn't too harsh.\n\nWear Comfortable Shoes: You'll want to explore every corner of this fantastic zoo!\n\nBring Water and Snacks: Stay hydrated and energized throughout your visit."

              "reviewText": "Visited the Lucknow Zoo recently. Overall, it's a small but decent zoo with a fair collection of animals and a good layout. However, I was quite surprised by the lack of proper facilities, especially considering this is in the state capital.\n\nThe park area is in poor condition and needs urgent attention. There’s very little for kids to explore and enjoy beyond the animals. The adventure zone is substandard, and most activities there are chargeable — even the most basic ones. Not all families can afford to pay extra for things that should ideally be free or included with the entry ticket. On top of that, the staff in the adventure zone were rude and unhelpful.\n\nOn a positive note, the zoo train is fun and reasonably priced — definitely a highlight for children.\n\nOverall, an okay experience, but I sincerely urge the concerned authorities to improve the kids’ facilities and overall maintenance. For a zoo located in a state capital, expectations are naturally higher."

Experience of toy train is very bad . On weekends and public holidays they sell more tickets than seats and public fight with each other for seat and no management or any queue. As well as train move so fast that we cannot enjoy or watch beautiful sights at last you have to walk out. You can not watch animals from 360 degree you have to wait animals to come out near barricade to watch out."

The layout is well-maintained, the enclosures are clean, and the variety of animals makes it a perfect place for families and wildlife enthusiasts. Walking through the zoo, you can really enjoy the greenery and the organized pathways—it’s a great spot for a day out.\n\nHowever, the counter does not accept online payments via PhonePe or card, which is frustrating. In an era of Digital India, it’s surprising that they still insist on cash, which feels outdated and inconvenient. It raises questions about efficiency and transparency.\n\nThat said, once you’re inside, the zoo itself is fantastic and worth visiting. It just needs a little modernization in payment options to match the quality of the experience inside."

It is in the old part of the city, near the famous Bara Imambara and Rumi Darwaza. Inside, there's a mosque, a tomb, a clock tower, a garden, and even a pond. The main building, the Imambara itself, is where Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah and his mother are buried. Shia Muslims gather here during Muharram.\nStart by seeing the Rumi Darwaza, Clock Tower, and Satkhanda first, as they're outside and free to explore. You can buy a combined ticket from the Bara Imambara ticket counter for just ₹50, which covers the Bara Imambara (including the Bhool Bhulaiya and Bouli), the Chota Imambara (including the Shahi Hamam), and the Picture Gallery. There are separate fees for cameras.\nEach spot has its own special charm, but remember, you can't take photos or videos inside the Imambara building itself. The grounds are beautifully kept, with lovely ponds, ornate gates, stylish lamps, and colorful gardens. It's a place that draws visitors from all over the world to admire its architecture, art, and history.\nTo really appreciate it, it's a good idea to read up on its history beforehand, or you can hire a guide. Parking is available nearby, and the place is wheelchair accessible. Plan to spend at least an hour exploring. You will not regret it!!"

It's best to come before it gets dark to fully enjoy the stunning interiors and reflections on the water. Built by Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah in 1838, the structure is beautifully ornate and holds deep cultural value. Mr Ikhlaq and friends guided us here too. Right opposite, there’s a local food court where you can enjoy Lucknowi biryanis and other tasty snacks. A calm and culturally rich spot worth visiting."

This place is a part of the complete \"Nawab Circuit\" that includes Bada Imambara, Shahi Bauli, Bhool Bhulaiya and Photo Gallery. You can either purchase a combo-ticket for the entire \"Nawab Circuit\" or buy separate tickets for selective places. Chota Imambara mesmerized me with its mind-blowing ancient architecture, massive water-pond, gardens, lush greenery and most importantly the antique collections inside the Imambara. Visiting this Imambara was tantamount to going back in time and the complete vibe of this location is bound to give you goosebumps. There is also a Shahi Hammam (Bathing Room), which is not too well-maintained. Overall, the Chota Imambara encapsulates centuries of Nawabi heritage under one-roof. Highly recommended to visit. 🕌🌟"

Beautiful monument taken well care and respect. Marvellous architectural piece of Lucknow.\n\nJama Masjid Lucknow\n\nAdding a unique charm in the historical significance of the city of Nawabs, is the famous Jama Masjid in Lucknow. Built by Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah Bahadur in the year 1839, Jama Masjid is one of the oldest historical landmarks in Lucknow. Along with being a popular tourist site, it also serves as an important religious centre in Lucknow for the Muslim community. Despite being compared with Jama Masjid of Delhi, this mosque has gained its own popularity because of its unique architectural design. Unlike Delhi's Jama Masjid, this one is built of Lakhuri bricks and is plastered with lime. At present, Jama Masjid along with other popular tourist attractions of Lucknow pioneer the tourism scene of the city.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of this renowned mosque is quite interesting.

However, his dream was left unfulfilled because of his sudden demise. Thereafter, his wife, Malika Jahan Begum, took the charge to finish of the construction of this much-famed mosque in Lucknow. But because of the shortage of funds, the original ambition was curtailed. Despite constructed on a low budget, Jama Masjid has an unrivalled charm.\n\nArchitecture\n\nLike most of the popular historical sites in Lucknow, Jama Masjid also boasts an impressive Mughal architecture. It is completely built of Lakhuri bricks and lime. Along with that, the entire structure of the mosque is magnificently adorned with stucco motifs, which adds a different grandeur in the stunning architecture of Jama Masjid. The mosque complex is erected on a square terrace and stands straight on around 260 pillars. Inside the mosque, there is a prayer hall which is rectangular in shape and a beautiful facade of eleven arches that located on the west. The central facade is largest of all with includes an imposing gateway which is also adorned with gorgeous stucco work.\n\nOn the top of the prayer hall lies the three pear-shaped domes that are exquisitely ornamented with the inverted lotus of their top. Along with that, these domes are surrounded four-storey minarets placed on either side. The walls and domes include the intricate patterns and mural designs. Along with that, various inscriptions can also be found on the walls of pillars. The tomb of Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah lies on the eastern side, whereas, the Imambara of Malika Jahan is also located on the western side of the mosque complex.\n\nLocation Address\n\nJama Masjid, Tehseenganj, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 226004, India.\n\nVisiting Timings\n\nJama Masjid of Lucknow remains accessible all day a week. One can visit the place at any time from 5 in the morning to 9 in the evening.\n\nEntry Fee\n\nNo Entry Fee"

But projectors do not work at all. So there is only sound.\nAll the models are there in a single small room. With just 6 models.\nSimply a waste of time. Science Center and zoo are far better.\nThe staff is also not polite.\nEntry cost is Rs 25. Parking is Rs 10."

Its basically a museum which contains prototype of satellites,radio ,tv, information reagrding universe especially our solar system and various space missions of india. They also show a 45 min movie which enhance our knowledge regarding space and various elements of it i.e coments ,sun ,galaxy. A must visit place for a person who is intrested in science or space. Proper equipment is not working over there so poor image quality. Don't waste your time to visit over there it is one of the government project so only not getting proper service of equipment. When I ask for ticket counter person said minimum 15 person should come to watch the show. if 15 person will be not there then we will not start the show. 10-15 person came then they allowed us for ticket. people are not coming over there because quality is not maintaining by the team they are not using mask but they are selling the mass from window and telling that without mask entries not there."

The saturn shaped building is interesting architecture.\nThe fee for Indians is 25₹ per person.\nThe skydome is cool and once the show starts, it almost feels like looking up at the night sky and seeing stars.\nThe tech is nice.\n\nCons-\nOnly the first show of the day is in English. (If you're familiar with words like saurmandal, urjakumbh, akashganga- good for you. If not, get ready to learn new words!!)\nThe place has seen better days. It's not that well maintained.\nThe crowd is mostly composed of people with pre-teen kids. These kids don't like dark so much, so their parents keep flashing their mobile phones right onto the screen.\n\nBonus- I am pretty sure the projector kept crashing inbetween the slides, but when I asked the personnel, they were clueless. I guess it has been going on for so long that that's the way they remember it now. The audio and visuals weren't in proper sync, and animation was way off.\nThe content presentation could be way better.\nThey literally end the show on the big bang theory. That's not the end, that is the beginning of any show!"

The surrounding area, which used to be well-maintained, is now littered and unkempt, detracting from the tower's historic charm. The structure itself, though still impressive, shows signs of wear, with fading paint and some visible cracks. The lack of proper lighting also makes it less appealing, especially in the evening.\n\nLocal authorities seem to have overlooked the need for regular maintenance and preservation of this historic site. It’s disappointing to see such a significant piece of Lucknow’s history not receiving the care it deserves. There’s a pressing need for restoration and better upkeep to bring the Clock Tower back to its former glory and preserve it for future generations to appreciate."

They made their first visit to the location after an unnecessary delay and packed up in 1 hour after being unable to shoot effectively. I pursued them for 2 weeks after that, for which they agreed to show up for an ecommerce shoot. Their main photographer seemed disinterested and wanted to leave midway. After being promised the final edits of this shoot in 1 week, it took me close to 20 days to get a final edited set from them. This includes calling them twice or thrice daily with no response. They would just not answer my calls or respond to my texts. Have had one of my worst experiences with them. Would not recommend at all."

Our photos turned out better than we could have ever hoped! SJ team captured every single moment and detail of our big day perfectly. We had SO MANY great shots from our wedding and pre wedding- I don't think there was a single photo we didn't love. I can't say enough great things about this photographer. We were worried that we won't be able to find a good photographer who could stack up to Delhi photographers, but Shaurya won us over with his sweet disposition, flexibility and his amazing eye for detail and framing. He is super fun to work with and helps you relax for the camera. He also really knows what he  is doing and takes awesome pictures. Shaurya took our engagement photos (btw he knows all of the best locations) and he took our wedding day photos...we liked him so much .! I would definitely work with them again in the future. You will not be disappointed with Shaurya and his team!!♥️👌"

Normally I'm the kind of person who is camera conscious and always thought my photos don't turn out to be as good. Now I know that when you have the right photographer magic happens :) He made us feel very comfortable and treated us like models :) It was a very memorable experience which we will cherish for rest of our lives. Being a creative person myself it was fascinating to see creativity at work and ideas turning into photos. They also shared perfect pictures with us on the same evening of the photo shoot.I highly recommend the wedding myntra Team  to capture your special moments. Thanks to them once again and best wishes!"

              "reviewText": "Rumi Darwaza, one of Lucknow’s most iconic landmarks, stands as a majestic symbol of the city’s rich Nawabi heritage and architectural brilliance. Built in 1784 by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula during a period of severe famine, the structure not only provided employment to thousands but also left behind a masterpiece that continues to awe visitors centuries later. Often referred to as the “Turkish Gate” due to its Awadhi architectural style inspired by Turkish design, the Rumi Darwaza rises to a height of 60 feet, with a striking arched gateway and intricately carved floral motifs adorning its surface.\n\nSadly, in recent years, the monument has undergone a round of repainting rather than proper restoration. The use of modern paints, rather than historically accurate conservation techniques, has slightly dulled its original charm. Yet, even this cosmetic intervention hasn’t managed to mask its beauty. The gateway still exudes elegance and grandeur.\n\nWhat makes Rumi Darwaza even more intriguing is its resemblance to the shape of a traditional necklace — and to those familiar with Lucknow’s textile artistry, it uncannily echoes the layout of a chikan kurta design. It’s a bridge between architecture and culture, the physical and the artistic. Despite changes over time, Rumi Darwaza continues to be a proud emblem of Lucknow’s past and present."

The Bhool Bhulaiya in Bara Imambara in Lucknow is a labyrinth of interconnected tunnels, with each path branching into many others and only one leads to the exit. It is a must visit as the exiting the labyrinth will be challenging and time consuming. Place is maintained well and organised crowd management by the authorities are appreciative."

              "reviewText": "A place with picture worthy views but  mismanaged by authorities\n\nI was born in Lucknow, and I am a local.\nToday I visited the Imambara 3rd time in my life, last visit was in 2008 and these are the below things I observed.\n1. There is no  baggage or security check. This place is piece of cake for any one with bad intentions or wants to cause havoc.\n2. Ticket price for adults is INR 50 which is ok but for visiting the roof area or the bhool bhulaiyaa, a guide has to be hired which will cost minimum INR 100.\n3. Before entering the Imambara or the bhool bhulaiya everyone must deposit his/her shoes outside the inner Imambara entrance and the men at the deposit counter will say \"jo dena ho dede\" which means the price for security deposit is not fixed and they mostly keep shoes and slippers in open. If there is rain the shoes can get wet. There is no proper cloak room.\n4. Since taking guide is mandatory for bhool bhulaiya we had to forcefully do so and the guide will take you and show you the various holy things kept in Imambara. The guide that we got was named Raja Hindustani and his diction was not at all clear. He took us on the narrow paths made of the dome of the Imambara without footwear and there was no lights and the floor is broken at places and can cause cuts and bruises. The maintenance of this place is worst I have ever experienced. I will suggest not to take small kids here and that too on a weekend. My 4 year daughter was feeling scared and also this place is not for claustrophobic people.\n5. Our guide passed a comment too on my wife which she opposed and yelled at him after which our group consisting of 40 people praised and clapped for my wife as she vented out at the guide who all the group members were forced to follow even though his way of explaining things or tackling crowd was pathetic. Many women came and told my wife \" good you shouted at him \" as all of the people were frustrated but not speaking up against the unruly behaviour of the guide.\n6. Since the roof is all stones and everywhere it is hard and uneven , walking on it for kids is very hard and chances of getting hurt are high.\n7. Nevertheless it is a picturesque place and if you hire a proper guide who takes more money your experience can be better but the forced guide system and no light being in the narrow pathways is risky for women.\nThe forced guide will charge INR 150 for complete tour.\n8. Now my next visit maybe after next 15 16 years and if given a chance may not visit at all.\nI love Lucknow for the food and culture but at present taking some outsider to this place may only cause you embarrassment. They should install lights in dark pathways and remove the mandate of removing shoes on the roof of the building as it causes huge discomfort to tourists. The renovation from outside makes the building look pretty."

I got the opportunity to visit this place and its entry ticket gives you access to visit other nearby iconic destinations too, like Chota Imambara, Shahi Bauli, Bhool Bhulaiya etc. In the Bada Imambara you are required to deposit your shoes in the shoe counter before entering its many impressive sections. One important point to note is that they don't allow unmarried couples to enter Bhool Bhulaiya without hiring a guide.\nOverall, it's a spectacular place to visit in Lucknow!💫"

              "reviewText": "Bada Imambada in Lucknow is one of the city’s most iconic monuments and a must-visit for history and architecture lovers. Built in 1784 by Nawab Asaf-ud-Daula, this grand complex reflects the elegance of Mughal and Awadhi architecture, constructed without the use of wood or iron.\n\nThe highlight of the monument is the Bhulbhulaiya (labyrinth) – a fascinating maze of narrow passages, countless identical doorways, and hidden staircases. Exploring it is both exciting and slightly mysterious, and it’s easy to lose your way without a guide. Hiring a local guide is strongly recommended, as they not only help you navigate the maze but also share interesting historical stories about the Imambada.\n\nAnother marvel is the central arched hall, one of the largest in the world without any supporting beams. Standing inside feels majestic and showcases the genius of 18th-century engineering. The complex also includes the Asfi Mosque and the Shahi Baoli (stepwell), each worth visiting for their design and historical significance.\n\nThe site is generally well maintained, with reasonable entry fees, and combined tickets give access to all attractions inside. Weekends and holidays can be crowded, so mornings are the best time to visit. Parking is available outside, and after exploring, you can enjoy authentic Lucknowi food at nearby eateries.\n\nOverall, Bara Imambada along with the famous Bhulbhulaiya is an unforgettable experience – a mix of history, culture, and architectural brilliance. A true jewel of Lucknow!"

              "reviewText": "In the resplendent city of Lucknow, a towering marvel of modernity pierces the sky – the illustrious Clock Tower, a masterpiece of Moorish design, erstwhile believed to be the largest in the Indian subcontinent. This magnificent edifice, a symphony of stone and steel, is illuminated by a dazzling array of lamps, its beauty further enhanced by the melodic chime of five bells, whose sweet peals echo through the air. Standing tall at 221 feet, this grandiose structure is an exemplar of traditional British architecture, rivaling the iconic Big Ben of London in both splendor and majesty. Its colossal wheels, a marvel of engineering, surpass even those of its London counterpart.\n\nConceived by the visionary architect of those times- Richard Roskell Bayne, this monumental clock tower was erected at a cost of two lakhs, funded by the benevolent Trustees of the Husainabad Endowment, who wisely invested the legacy of thirty-six lakhs of rupees bequeathed by the illustrious Muhammad Ali Shah, third King of Oudh. Bayne’s masterpiece, a testament to his ingenuity, boasts a intricate machinery comprising wrought-iron sides, gun-metal wheels, and hardened steel pinions, precision-crafted to ensure unwavering accuracy.\n\nThis majestic timepiece, a true marvel of modern science, stands as a shining beacon, a testament to the confluence of art and engineering. Its grandeur is a reflection of Bayne’s prolific career, which spanned the construction of bridges, train stations, and bungalows, as well as monumental buildings such as the East India Railway Office, New Market in Kolkata, and Oak Grove School in Mussoorie. His legacy extends to the Thornhill and Mayne Memorial Library and Mayo Memorial in Allahabad, a testament to his enduring impact on India’s architectural landscape."

The architecture is absolutely stunning, with grand arches, intricate carvings, and a beautifully maintained garden that adds to the charm of the place. It’s not just a monument — it feels like stepping back in time. The central hall is massive and awe-inspiring, and the Bhulbhulaiya (labyrinth) is a must-try for a bit of fun and mystery. It’s a peaceful, clean, and well-kept heritage site, perfect for history lovers, photographers, or anyone wanting a glimpse of Lucknow’s royal past. Highly recommended if you’re visiting the city!"

I went there on a quiet afternoon, and the moment I entered, I felt like I had just time-travelled back into history. The structure is in ruins but still looks so beautiful and grand – you can imagine how royal it must’ve been back in the day.\n\nThe place is super peaceful, barely any crowd, and surrounded by greenery. I just walked around slowly, soaking in the old architecture and taking some cool photos – perfect spot for anyone who loves historic vibes. And the best part is, it’s not commercialized or noisy like other places. Just calm, raw, and real.\n\nIf you ever want a chill place to explore that also connects you with Lucknow's past, then this is the spot. Pure peaceful vibe and a solid escape from the city chaos."

This historic baroque mansion which saw great action during the 1857 revolution period should be a must on everyone's calendar. Site facilities are however non existent. Drinking water fountains do not work and the main information centre and souvenir shop is now a glorious outhouse for staff. The lawns are reasonably well maintained and inner courtyards of both structures remain locked without explanation. Old signs of vandalism and brainless love scribbles exist as a reminder that a lot of people don't value Heritage.\n\nGripes apart, this is a must visit and barely a 10 mins ride from City centre. This hunting lodge cum Summer retreat for the nawabs and British residents alike would have been a vibrant place in the early 19th century. Hopefully the tourism development corporation would better publicize this place and allot a decent budget for better upkeep and maintenance.\n\nEntry is free from sunrise till sunset but you may find the main gate locked till 10 am. Even otherwise, the gate was perplexingly locked with a loose chain which makes visitors squeeze through the gates. Parking is amply available on site for two and four wheelers."

It’s weak now since it was built long time back and there hasn’t been much renovation or work done on it so that’s something the Lucknow government should look into since all these places reflect what LUCKNOW was.\nThough, if you’re a foreigner this place is a must visit during evenings. Sunset too could be beautiful from here."

You can click photos or roam in the garden area. There is no entry fee here. Recommended for history enthusiasts.🩵"

Recently, I finally took the time to revisit this historic gem — and I’m so glad I did.\n\nThe moment you step inside, you’re transported to a time that shaped India’s history. The ruins, still marked with bullet holes and cannon fire, silently narrate the intensity of the 1857 revolt. Each structure within the complex — from the Baillie Guard Gate and Treasury to the church ruins and underground chambers — holds a haunting charm.\n\nWalking through the wide lawns and shaded pathways, I spent time at the museum, the graveyard, and the many crumbling buildings that once formed the heart of British residency life. The view from the top of some of the structures is breathtaking, and the atmosphere is both peaceful and reflective.\n\nIt’s not just a monument, it’s a memory — of resilience, history, and a city that has seen so much. If you’re in Lucknow, The Residency deserves your time and attention."

You can even purchase from here small guide cum history books on Konark, Goa, Delhi etc. which are limited edition publications of ASI and is not available in the market.

Beautiful monument taken well care and respect. Marvellous architectural piece of Lucknow.\n\nJama Masjid Lucknow\n\nAdding a unique charm in the historical significance of the city of Nawabs, is the famous Jama Masjid in Lucknow. Built by Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah Bahadur in the year 1839, Jama Masjid is one of the oldest historical landmarks in Lucknow. Along with being a popular tourist site, it also serves as an important religious centre in Lucknow for the Muslim community. Despite being compared with Jama Masjid of Delhi, this mosque has gained its own popularity because of its unique architectural design. Unlike Delhi's Jama Masjid, this one is built of Lakhuri bricks and is plastered with lime. At present, Jama Masjid along with other popular tourist attractions of Lucknow pioneer the tourism scene of the city.\n\nHistory\n\nThe history of this renowned mosque is quite interesting. In the year 1839, Nawab Mohammad Ali Shah laid the foundation of Jama Masjid in Lucknow as an intention to surpass Jama Masjid of Delhi. However, his dream was left unfulfilled because of his sudden demise. Thereafter, his wife, Malika Jahan Begum, took the charge to finish of the construction of this much-famed mosque in Lucknow. But because of the shortage of funds, the original ambition was curtailed. Despite constructed on a low budget, Jama Masjid has an unrivalled charm.\n\nArchitecture\n\nLike most of the popular historical sites in Lucknow, Jama Masjid also boasts an impressive Mughal architecture. It is completely built of Lakhuri bricks and lime. Along with that, the entire structure of the mosque is magnificently adorned with stucco motifs, which adds a different grandeur in the stunning architecture of Jama Masjid. The mosque complex is erected on a square terrace and stands straight on around 260 pillars. Inside the mosque, there is a prayer hall which is rectangular in shape and a beautiful facade of eleven arches that located on the west. The central facade is largest of all with includes an imposing gateway which is also adorned with gorgeous stucco work.\n\nOn the top of the prayer hall lies the three pear-shaped domes that are exquisitely ornamented with the inverted lotus of their top. Along with that, these domes are surrounded four-storey minarets placed on either side. The walls and domes include the intricate patterns and mural designs. Along with that, various inscriptions can also be found on the walls of pillars. The tomb of Nawab Muhammad Ali Shah lies on the eastern side, whereas, the Imambara of Malika Jahan is also located on the western side of the mosque complex.\n\nLocation Address\n\nJama Masjid, Tehseenganj, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh 226004, India.\n\nVisiting Timings\n\nJama Masjid of Lucknow remains accessible all day a week. One can visit the place at any time from 5 in the morning to 9 in the evening.\n\nEntry Fee\n\nNo Entry Fee"

Constructed in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, it served as the residence of the Nawabs of Awadh and later became a significant site during the Indian Rebellion of 1857.\n\nThe architectural style of Chattar Manzil is a captivating blend of Indo-European and Nawabi influences. Its most striking feature is the dome crowned with a unique umbrella-shaped structure, which gives the palace its name. The interiors, though weathered over time, were once adorned with intricate carvings and opulent decor that reflected the Nawabs' grandeur and sophistication. The palace's location along the banks of the Gomti River enhances its scenic appeal, making it a picturesque spot for visitors.\n\nHistorically, Chattar Manzil is significant as it served as a strategic site during the First War of Indian Independence. The palace housed revolutionaries who resisted British forces, adding layers of historical depth to its aesthetic allure.\n\nIn recent decades, the monument suffered neglect, leading to deterioration. However, government and conservation groups have initiated restoration efforts to preserve its legacy. Today, it stands as a symbol of Lucknow’s regal past and resilience.\n\nA visit to Chattar Manzil offers a unique experience, combining architectural marvels, historical significance, and cultural richness. It is a must-see for history enthusiasts, architecture lovers, and those seeking to delve into Lucknow's glorious Nawabi era."

A part of ASI's list of protected monument, it was delisted in 1960s resulting in its ruin and plunder. The CDRI which was housed in this monument played havoc with its architecture and spoilt the interiors. Declared a protected monument again in 2013 by the State Archaeology, this monument is now under repairs and renovation. Hope that the restored monument is put to public viewing soon, making us proud of our magnificent heritage."

Chattar Manzil situated on the banks of Rover Gomti near Qaiserbagh and Hazratganj. Its Mughal architecture design is very eye pleasing even nowadays when it becomes a ruined structure.\n\nIt was constructed by order of Nawab Ghaziuddin Haider and completed after his death by his successor, Nawab Nadiruddin Haider. The Chattar Manzil consisted of a Bari (larger) Chattar Manzil and Chhoti (smaller) Chattar Manzil, however only the larger one still exists. The Palace has gone through many owners including the Nawabs of Awadh Saadat Ali Khan and Wajid Ali Shah, and the Britishers and changes since its construction was started in the 1780s.\n\nIt's not a very great sight to go to but if you have enough time in lucknow you can visit."

Its basically a museum which contains prototype of satellites,radio ,tv, information reagrding universe especially our solar system and various space missions of india. They also show a 45 min movie which enhance our knowledge regarding space and various elements of it i.e coments ,sun ,galaxy. A must visit place for a person who is intrested in science or space. Proper equipment is not working over there so poor image quality. Don't waste your time to visit over there it is one of the government project so only not getting proper service of equipment. When I ask for ticket counter person said minimum 15 person should come to watch the show. if 15 person will be not there then we will not start the show. 10-15 person came then they allowed us for ticket. people are not coming over there because quality is not maintaining by the team they are not using mask but they are selling the mass from window and telling that without mask entries not there."

The saturn shaped building is interesting architecture.\nThe fee for Indians is 25₹ per person.\nThe skydome is cool and once the show starts, it almost feels like looking up at the night sky and seeing stars.\nThe tech is nice.\n\nCons-\nOnly the first show of the day is in English. (If you're familiar with words like saurmandal, urjakumbh, akashganga- good for you. If not, get ready to learn new words!!)\nThe place has seen better days. It's not that well maintained.\nThe crowd is mostly composed of people with pre-teen kids. These kids don't like dark so much, so their parents keep flashing their mobile phones right onto the screen.\n\nBonus- I am pretty sure the projector kept crashing inbetween the slides, but when I asked the personnel, they were clueless. I guess it has been going on for so long that that's the way they remember it now. The audio and visuals weren't in proper sync, and animation was way off.\nThe content presentation could be way better.\nThey literally end the show on the big bang theory. That's not the end, that is the beginning of any show!"

Honestly, I didn’t know much about design when I started the project, but they made everything feel so easy and smooth. The team, especially Ravi sir, was very calm, patient and always ready to listen to what I wanted, no matter how small or random my ideas were.\n\nWhat I liked the most was that they never forced their own designs on me. They understood what I was trying to say (even when I wasn’t able to explain it properly) and gave me better suggestions that matched my style but were also more practical. They handled the whole project very professionally and kept me updated at every step, which gave me a lot of confidence and peace of mind.\n\nOf course, there were some ups and downs during the execution phase — delays and small confusions here and there — but that’s normal in any project. What matters is that they handled it well and always found solutions without making it stressful for me.\n\nNow that the project is complete, I can say the space looks even better than I imagined. It feels warm, well thought out, and honestly, very “me.” Friends and family who visit always compliment the design, and it just feels good living in a space that’s so well put together.\n\nIf you're planning to get any design work done and want a team that actually listens and delivers more than what they promise, I’d 100% recommend Ravi Prakash Architects."

              "reviewText": "Hello, I had planned to build a house in Lucknow and came across some property designs by RPA (Ravi Prakash Associates). After some research, I got in touch with Mr. Ravi Prakash through his brother, as Ravi often lives abroad. Following our discussions, I paid an advance of ₹40,000 to initiate the project.\n\nUnfortunately, my experience with RPA was extremely disappointing. Despite following up for several months, the only output I received was a very basic and unprofessional 2D design, which lacked detail and effort. Ravi assured me that it was just the initial version and would be improved, but no further progress was ever made.\n\nDue to the poor communication and lack of professionalism, I decided to discontinue the project. I requested a partial refund—asking to deduct ₹10,000 for the basic design—but Ravi stopped responding. Initially, his brother mentioned that the refund would be processed after speaking with Ravi, but later I was told the money would not be returned at all.\n\nWhat’s more concerning is that I later learned from some of his past clients that this kind of experience is not unusual. It appears that working with clients in Lucknow is not a priority for Ravi, and his approach seems more like a side business. He is very difficult to reach and unresponsive to important discussions.\n\nI’m not writing this to recover my money but to warn others—please be cautious if you plan to work with RPA or Ravi Prakash. Based on my experience, he lacks the dedication and professionalism expected from a reputed architect.\nI consider this kind of activity as fraud. Anybody else here face the same problem? If we do not raise voice today many other like me will be cheated by RPA. Thank you!"
