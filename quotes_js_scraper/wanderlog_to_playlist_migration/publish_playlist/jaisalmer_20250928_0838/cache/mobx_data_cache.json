This beautifully preserved haveli showcases the grandeur of Rajasthan’s rich history and intricate craftsmanship. The detailed carvings, exquisite balconies, and stunning jharokhas reflect the architectural brilliance of the bygone era.\n\nMuseum and Artifacts: The museum inside provides insightful details about the merchant families who once lived here, along with displays of traditional artifacts and paintings. The interiors hold a treasure trove of old letters, artifacts, and remnants from the British era, offering a rare glimpse into the lifestyle, trade practices, and social dynamics of that period.\n\nArchitecture and Craftsmanship: Built in the early 19th century by the wealthy Patwa family, this haveli is a testament to their immense wealth and influence. Each of the five havelis took around 12 years to complete and showcase unparalleled craftsmanship. Remarkably, these grand structures were built without cement or iron, relying solely on the ingenious rock-locking technique—a testament to the engineering brilliance of the time. The craftsmanship is simply stunning, with detailed facades, delicate balconies, and elaborate jali work.\n\nVisitor Experience: A visit to this haveli feels like stepping back in time. If you love history and heritage, this place is definitely worth exploring. We got a guide who took us through the haveli, explaining everything. He charged us Rs. 50, but it was absolutely worth it. It took us about 20 minutes to explore the place. The view from the top is breathtaking, offering a panoramic sight of Jaisalmer’s golden landscape. Tips for Visitors: Visit early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid crowds. Don’t miss the rooftop view; it’s absolutely worth it! A guide or audio tour enhances the experience significantly. Try not to go on public holidays or weekends as it's crowded and one may not enjoy taking photos. The market around the haveli offers good antiques and handcrafted items, though they can be a bit pricey.\n\nRecommendation: Patwon Ki Haveli is a true architectural marvel in the heart of Jaisalmer. It’s a must-see for anyone interested in architecture and history. The haveli’s beautiful courtyards, finely carved windows, and stunning interiors make it a must-visit for anyone exploring the cultural legacy of Jaisalmer. Highly recommended!\n\nPractical Information:\nEntry Fee: ₹150 per person.\nGuide Fee: ₹150.\nBest Time to Visit: Early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat and enjoy the golden glow of the fort.\nDuration: Approximately 1 hour. Washrooms: Not available.\nParking: Not available.\n\nEnjoy your visit to this magnificent piece of history!"

Built with yellow sandstone, the fort glows like gold under sunlight, which is why it’s called “Sonar Kila”. Its massive walls, intricate carvings, and royal gateways reflect the rich heritage and craftsmanship of Rajasthan.\n\nDuring my Jaisalmer visit, unfortunately, I couldn’t explore the fort from the inside due to time limitations, but I managed to capture some beautiful night-time photos from outside. The fort looks even more mesmerizing at night when it’s beautifully lit, creating a magical view.\n\nNext time, I definitely plan to explore the fort from inside, as it’s home to historic palaces, Jain temples, and vibrant markets. Even if you can’t go inside, I highly recommend visiting Sonar Kila at least once to witness its majestic beauty from the outside — it’s truly unforgettable!"

              "reviewText": "Gadisar Lake, Jaisalmer – A Serene Oasis in the Golden City\n\nGadisar Lake, located on the outskirts of Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, is one of the most picturesque and historically significant attractions of the city. This artificial lake, originally built in the 14th century by Maharawal Gadsi Singh, was once the primary source of water for the arid region. Today, it stands as a beautiful blend of history, architecture, and natural beauty, drawing tourists from all over the world.\n\nScenic Beauty and Atmosphere\n\nThe first thing that strikes you about Gadisar Lake is its breathtaking beauty. Surrounded by stunning yellow sandstone temples, ghats, and intricately carved chhatris (cenotaphs), the lake offers a postcard-perfect view, especially during sunrise and sunset. The calm waters of the lake reflect the golden hues of Jaisalmer’s architecture, creating a mesmerizing scene.\n\nThe lake is home to a variety of migratory birds, especially during the winter season. Bird watchers can spot species like cranes, pelicans, and kingfishers, making it a paradise for nature lovers. The gentle ripples in the water, combined with the chirping of birds and the occasional sound of temple bells, create a peaceful and soothing environment.\n\nBoating Experience\n\nOne of the highlights of visiting Gadisar Lake is the boating experience. Paddle boats and rowboats are available, allowing visitors to explore the lake at a leisurely pace. As you glide across the water, you get an up-close view of the stunning structures that surround the lake. The reflections of the chhatris and temples in the water make for some truly amazing photo opportunities.\n\nBoating is best enjoyed during the early morning or late evening when the weather is pleasant, and the golden light enhances the beauty of the surroundings. The experience is both relaxing and romantic, making it perfect for couples, families, and solo travelers alike.\n\nArchitectural Marvels and Temples\n\nThe lake is not just a scenic spot but also a place of historical and architectural significance. The Tilon Ki Pol, an elaborately carved sandstone gateway at the entrance of the lake, adds to its charm. According to legend, this gateway was built by a royal courtesan, Tilon, despite opposition from the ruling king. It is believed that she cleverly built a temple of Lord Krishna on top of the gate, ensuring that it would never be demolished.\n\nSeveral small temples and shrines dedicated to Hindu deities line the lake’s periphery, adding to its spiritual aura. The intricate carvings on the sandstone structures reflect the rich craftsmanship of Rajasthan and are a testament to Jaisalmer’s glorious past.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nThe best time to visit Gadisar Lake is during the winter months (October to March) when the weather is pleasant and ideal for sightseeing and boating. Summers in Jaisalmer can be extremely hot, making it difficult to enjoy outdoor activities. Early mornings and evenings are the best times to experience the lake’s beauty, as the golden sunlight creates a magical effect on the water and surrounding architecture."

The reflections of the golden-hued architecture on the calm waters, the sight of migratory birds in winter, and the option to enjoy a boat ride make it a must-visit. The atmosphere is peaceful, making it perfect for an early morning or sunset visit.\n\nWhether you're interested in history, photography, or just want to enjoy a quiet moment by the water, Gadisar Lake is a delightful stop in Jaisalmer."

Nestled on the edge of the city, this man-made lake was originally built in the 14th century by Maharawal Gadsi Singh to serve as a water conservation tank for the arid desert region. Beyond its practical purpose, the lake today stands as a beautiful blend of history, architecture, and natural serenity.\n\nSurrounded by intricately carved chhatris (cenotaphs), temples, and ghats, the lake reflects the architectural grace of Rajasthan. The calm waters, especially during sunrise or sunset, create a picture-perfect scene with the golden hues of Jaisalmer glowing in the background. As a history student, what fascinated me most was how such water bodies played a crucial role in desert life, not just for survival, but also as spaces for worship, community gatherings, and cultural expression.\n\nBoating on the lake gave a closer look at the structures scattered across the water—reminders of the city's glorious past. Gadisar Lake is not just a tourist spot; it’s a historical site that tells the story of sustainable living and the spiritual connection between nature and culture in Rajasthan’s desert heartland."

There were various vendors selling traditional things, toys, local handicrafts, cuisine, and decorative items – ideal for those who enjoy shopping."

Various small shops and markets are located around the fort prices are slightly higher than average but again you can bargain. Several eateries near the fort are a must try."

Unlike most forts in India, people still reside inside, making it feel like a golden city within a fort. The yellow sandstone walls glow beautifully at sunrise and sunset, giving it the name “Sonar Quila” (Golden Fort).\n\nInside, you’ll find narrow lanes full of vibrant shops, handicrafts, rooftop cafes with stunning views, ancient Jain temples, and historic havelis. Exploring it feels like stepping back in time.\n\n✔️ Must-do:\n\nVisit during sunset for breathtaking golden hues.\n\nExplore Jain Temples (intricate carvings).\n\nWalk through the local markets for souvenirs.\n\nTry a rooftop café for city views.\n\n⚠️ Tips:\n\nWear comfortable footwear (lots of walking on stone paths).\n\nHire a local guide to know the hidden stories.\n\nEarly morning or evening visits are best to avoid heat.\n\nOverall, Jaisalmer Fort is a unique experience – a UNESCO World Heritage site where history, culture, and daily life blend seamlessly. A must-visit if you’re in Rajasthan!"

Built with yellow sandstone, the fort glows like gold under sunlight, which is why it’s called “Sonar Kila”. Its massive walls, intricate carvings, and royal gateways reflect the rich heritage and craftsmanship of Rajasthan.\n\nDuring my Jaisalmer visit, unfortunately, I couldn’t explore the fort from the inside due to time limitations, but I managed to capture some beautiful night-time photos from outside. The fort looks even more mesmerizing at night when it’s beautifully lit, creating a magical view.\n\nNext time, I definitely plan to explore the fort from inside, as it’s home to historic palaces, Jain temples, and vibrant markets. Even if you can’t go inside, I highly recommend visiting Sonar Kila at least once to witness its majestic beauty from the outside — it’s truly unforgettable!"

This magnificent palace, still partially serving as the residence of the royal family, transports visitors to a bygone era of Rajput grandeur.\n\nArchitectural Charm & Heritage\nThe exterior of Mandir Palace is a striking example of traditional **Rajputana architecture**, featuring ornately carved facades, jharokhas, and intricately designed archways. Its golden sandstone structure glows in the sunlight, making it a favorite for photography and heritage enthusiasts alike.\n\nInside, parts of the palace function as a **museum**, displaying a modest collection of royal artifacts, weapons, and historical relics. While not extensive, it provides a brief insight into Jaisalmer’s royal lineage.\n\n**rooftop view**—offering stunning panoramas of the **Jaisalmer Fort**, the Golden City, and the **Thar Desert**, especially at sunrise and sunset.\n\nVisiting Experience & Entry Fees\nMuseum comes at a fee of approximately **₹160–₹250**, with an additional **₹30** for mobile photography. While the architecture is beautiful, the **museum section is relatively small**, and some might find it underwhelming if expecting a large exhibit.\n\nOverall Impression\nMandir Palace / Badal Vilas is not just a structure—it's a **living piece of Jaisalmer's royal legacy**. While the museum might not justify the ticket price for every visitor, the architectural beauty, tranquil atmosphere, and regal charm still make it a **worthwhile stop**, especially for those interested in heritage and history."

The finely carved jharokhas, peaceful atmosphere, and the tall Badal Vilas tower offer a majestic view of the Golden City. Though the museum section is small, the charm of the palace and its rooftop views make it worth a visit. Ideal for photography lovers and those who appreciate history, but day visitors should know access is limited. Still, it's a must-visit gem for a quick royal experience in Jaisalmer."

Most of the doors are locked, and you’re not allowed to see the interior of many areas that are supposedly part of the tour.\n\nWhat made things worse was the rude and unprofessional behavior of the watchmen and staff. They were not helpful at all, and treated visitors with disrespect, which is completely unacceptable—especially at a historical or tourist site.\n\nThis place clearly survives on its name and heritage but doesn’t respect tourists or provide value for the money charged. Locals are not allowing to take photos from outside,I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone unless there are major improvements in how visitors are treated and what access is allowed."

              "reviewText": "Must-Visit Spot in Jaisalmer: Gadisar Lake 🌅✨\n\nGadisar Lake (also known as Gadsisar Lake) is an absolute gem that should be on every traveler’s Jaisalmer itinerary. Located just 1.5 km from the Jaisalmer Fort, this historic artificial reservoir dates back to 1156 AD, originally built by King Rawal Jaisal and later reconstructed by Gadsi Singh Bhati in 1367 AD.\n\nFrom the moment you arrive, the serene beauty of the lake is captivating. As the sun begins to set, the golden light reflects off the water, creating a dreamy, picture-perfect scene that feels straight out of a painting. The sky transforms into a canvas of soft, blended hues—ideal for a peaceful evening stroll or capturing some stunning photographs.\n\nSurrounding the lake are intricately carved temples, shrines, and cenotaphs (chhatris), showcasing the rich architectural heritage of Rajasthan. The atmosphere here blends natural beauty with artistic charm, making it a tranquil yet culturally enriching experience.\n\nThings to Do:\nBoating: Pedal and row boats are available, offering a calm ride across the lake. Prices range from ₹100 for a 2-seater pedal boat to ₹300 for a 6-seater rowboat.\nWildlife Watching: Spot catfish near the shore and enjoy watching migratory birds—perfect for nature lovers and photographers.\nSunset Views & Light Show: Arrive by 5 PM to find a good spot on the steps near the waterfront. Watch the mesmerizing sunset, followed by a light and sound show at 6:45 PM (entry included with fort ticket).\nStreet Food & Local Cuisine: Don’t miss the vibrant food stalls nearby offering delicious and affordable local snacks. Also try the well-known 1156 AD multi-cuisine restaurant for a more relaxed dining experience.\n\nKey Info:\nTimings: Open daily from 8:00 AM to 7:00 PM.\nEntry Fee: No entry fee required. Parking is available (paid).\nFacilities: Several shops at the entry point. However, washroom facilities were not visible, which could be improved.\nWater Source: The lake is maintained through the Indira Gandhi Canal, ensuring it remains full year-round.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nWhile there is some room for improvement in terms of cleanliness, Gadisar Lake remains a must-visit. The combination of history, art, nature, and local flavor makes it a unique and unforgettable destination in the heart of Jaisalmer. Whether you're looking to relax, explore, or indulge in Rajasthani culture, this peaceful lakeside spot offers it all.\n\nHighly recommended for an evening outing!"

You’ll find temples shrines and steps leading down into the lake, often with local kids attempting acrobatics off them while pigeons judge from above.\n\nPaddle boats are available if you’re feeling brave (or bored) and the vibe is equal parts peaceful and theatrical, think Venice if Venice had camels loitering at the entrance.\n\nNot sacred but oddly serene, Gadisar Lake is where Jaisalmer exhales, quietly beautifully and sometimes with a light fishy smell."

A double bed Rasai which is available online at Rs800 rs is priced as Rs 7500. Moreover none of the price is written in the item and they will claim it is a fixed price shop.

You will get better quality product in other near by shops on below half price. Dont fall for the scam they are doing here.\n\nVery arrogant and full of attitude staff. Metal Mina work horse, the one they are charging 8,000/- same I buy for 2750/- outside.\n\nSo think before buying here.\n\nOne hand made table top they are charging 3000/- same ai buy for 900/- outside.\n\nTry to visit local market, local shops, walk around the fort to buy things.\n\nSouvenir, clothes, blankets, leather, jewellery everything is expensive here.\n\nAdvice for shop, stop stealing money from your customers. Start providing fare price and single price to all. Me and my wife shopping separately you told me price 5000/- and my wife 3800/- how that is possible for one same product. So do a fare job. Dont corrupt the jaisalmer local business.\n\nThank you!"

There is no room for bargaining, and the prices are highly inflated. It was evident that the driver received a commission from our purchase.\n\nWe bought four sarees for ₹10,000, only to find the same sarees available for ₹5,000-₹6,000 in smaller shops at the fort. The salespeople at this shop made false promises and provided misleading information to entice us into buying. Their only aim seems to be trapping customers with lies to sell overpriced items.\n\nAvoid falling into the trap of this shop.

The carvings on the walls and balconies are so detailed that you can spend hours just admiring the craftsmanship.\n\nThe entry fee is very minimal, and totally worth it. The best part for me was climbing up to the roof—you get an incredible view of the Jaisalmer Fort standing tall in the distance. It’s one of those picture-perfect moments you’ll want to capture.\n\nThe streets outside are buzzing with life, full of stalls selling colorful handicrafts and souvenirs.\n\nTip: Go a little early in the day before it gets too crowded, and don’t miss the rooftop view!"

This beautifully preserved haveli showcases the grandeur of Rajasthan’s rich history and intricate craftsmanship. The detailed carvings, exquisite balconies, and stunning jharokhas reflect the architectural brilliance of the bygone era.\n\nMuseum and Artifacts: The museum inside provides insightful details about the merchant families who once lived here, along with displays of traditional artifacts and paintings. The interiors hold a treasure trove of old letters, artifacts, and remnants from the British era, offering a rare glimpse into the lifestyle, trade practices, and social dynamics of that period.\n\nArchitecture and Craftsmanship: Built in the early 19th century by the wealthy Patwa family, this haveli is a testament to their immense wealth and influence. Each of the five havelis took around 12 years to complete and showcase unparalleled craftsmanship. Remarkably, these grand structures were built without cement or iron, relying solely on the ingenious rock-locking technique—a testament to the engineering brilliance of the time. The craftsmanship is simply stunning, with detailed facades, delicate balconies, and elaborate jali work.\n\nVisitor Experience: A visit to this haveli feels like stepping back in time. If you love history and heritage, this place is definitely worth exploring. We got a guide who took us through the haveli, explaining everything. He charged us Rs. 50, but it was absolutely worth it. It took us about 20 minutes to explore the place. The view from the top is breathtaking, offering a panoramic sight of Jaisalmer’s golden landscape. Tips for Visitors: Visit early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid crowds. Don’t miss the rooftop view; it’s absolutely worth it! A guide or audio tour enhances the experience significantly. Try not to go on public holidays or weekends as it's crowded and one may not enjoy taking photos. The market around the haveli offers good antiques and handcrafted items, though they can be a bit pricey.\n\nRecommendation: Patwon Ki Haveli is a true architectural marvel in the heart of Jaisalmer. It’s a must-see for anyone interested in architecture and history. The haveli’s beautiful courtyards, finely carved windows, and stunning interiors make it a must-visit for anyone exploring the cultural legacy of Jaisalmer. Highly recommended!\n\nPractical Information:\nEntry Fee: ₹150 per person.\nGuide Fee: ₹150.\nBest Time to Visit: Early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat and enjoy the golden glow of the fort.\nDuration: Approximately 1 hour. Washrooms: Not available.\nParking: Not available.\n\nEnjoy your visit to this magnificent piece of history!"

A lavish sprawl of jharokhas, mirror work, wall murals, and carved arches that scream “Look Ma, I’m rich!” Walk carefully not for safety, but because your neck will hurt from gawking upward the whole time.

Built with yellow sandstone, the fort glows like gold under sunlight, which is why it’s called “Sonar Kila”. Its massive walls, intricate carvings, and royal gateways reflect the rich heritage and craftsmanship of Rajasthan.\n\nDuring my Jaisalmer visit, unfortunately, I couldn’t explore the fort from the inside due to time limitations, but I managed to capture some beautiful night-time photos from outside. The fort looks even more mesmerizing at night when it’s beautifully lit, creating a magical view.\n\nNext time, I definitely plan to explore the fort from inside, as it’s home to historic palaces, Jain temples, and vibrant markets. Even if you can’t go inside, I highly recommend visiting Sonar Kila at least once to witness its majestic beauty from the outside — it’s truly unforgettable!"

              "reviewText": "Gadisar Lake, Jaisalmer – A Serene Oasis in the Golden City\n\nGadisar Lake, located on the outskirts of Jaisalmer, Rajasthan, is one of the most picturesque and historically significant attractions of the city. This artificial lake, originally built in the 14th century by Maharawal Gadsi Singh, was once the primary source of water for the arid region. Today, it stands as a beautiful blend of history, architecture, and natural beauty, drawing tourists from all over the world.\n\nScenic Beauty and Atmosphere\n\nThe first thing that strikes you about Gadisar Lake is its breathtaking beauty. Surrounded by stunning yellow sandstone temples, ghats, and intricately carved chhatris (cenotaphs), the lake offers a postcard-perfect view, especially during sunrise and sunset. The calm waters of the lake reflect the golden hues of Jaisalmer’s architecture, creating a mesmerizing scene.\n\nThe lake is home to a variety of migratory birds, especially during the winter season. Bird watchers can spot species like cranes, pelicans, and kingfishers, making it a paradise for nature lovers. The gentle ripples in the water, combined with the chirping of birds and the occasional sound of temple bells, create a peaceful and soothing environment.\n\nBoating Experience\n\nOne of the highlights of visiting Gadisar Lake is the boating experience. Paddle boats and rowboats are available, allowing visitors to explore the lake at a leisurely pace. As you glide across the water, you get an up-close view of the stunning structures that surround the lake. The reflections of the chhatris and temples in the water make for some truly amazing photo opportunities.\n\nBoating is best enjoyed during the early morning or late evening when the weather is pleasant, and the golden light enhances the beauty of the surroundings. The experience is both relaxing and romantic, making it perfect for couples, families, and solo travelers alike.\n\nArchitectural Marvels and Temples\n\nThe lake is not just a scenic spot but also a place of historical and architectural significance. The Tilon Ki Pol, an elaborately carved sandstone gateway at the entrance of the lake, adds to its charm. According to legend, this gateway was built by a royal courtesan, Tilon, despite opposition from the ruling king. It is believed that she cleverly built a temple of Lord Krishna on top of the gate, ensuring that it would never be demolished.\n\nSeveral small temples and shrines dedicated to Hindu deities line the lake’s periphery, adding to its spiritual aura. The intricate carvings on the sandstone structures reflect the rich craftsmanship of Rajasthan and are a testament to Jaisalmer’s glorious past.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nThe best time to visit Gadisar Lake is during the winter months (October to March) when the weather is pleasant and ideal for sightseeing and boating. Summers in Jaisalmer can be extremely hot, making it difficult to enjoy outdoor activities. Early mornings and evenings are the best times to experience the lake’s beauty, as the golden sunlight creates a magical effect on the water and surrounding architecture."

              "reviewText": "Gadisar Lake – A Scenic and Historic Escape in Jaisalmer\n\nGadisar Lake is more than just a picturesque spot in Jaisalmer—it’s a place steeped in history and cultural significance. Built in the 14th century by Maharawal Gadsi Singh, this artificial reservoir was once the primary water source for the city. The beautifully carved temples, cenotaphs, and ghats surrounding it add to its old-world charm. The grand entrance, Tilon Ki Pol, has an interesting backstory—it was built by a courtesan, and to prevent its demolition, she had a Krishna temple constructed atop it.\n\nEven though it no longer serves as Jaisalmer’s main water source, the lake remains a serene retreat. The reflections of the golden-hued architecture on the calm waters, the sight of migratory birds in winter, and the option to enjoy a boat ride make it a must-visit. The atmosphere is peaceful, making it perfect for an early morning or sunset visit.\n\nWhether you're interested in history, photography, or just want to enjoy a quiet moment by the water, Gadisar Lake is a delightful stop in Jaisalmer."

              "reviewText": "Visited in 2019 during our college excursion, my visit to Gadisar Lake was one of the most peaceful and enriching experiences in Jaisalmer. Nestled on the edge of the city, this man-made lake was originally built in the 14th century by Maharawal Gadsi Singh to serve as a water conservation tank for the arid desert region. Beyond its practical purpose, the lake today stands as a beautiful blend of history, architecture, and natural serenity.\n\nSurrounded by intricately carved chhatris (cenotaphs), temples, and ghats, the lake reflects the architectural grace of Rajasthan. The calm waters, especially during sunrise or sunset, create a picture-perfect scene with the golden hues of Jaisalmer glowing in the background. As a history student, what fascinated me most was how such water bodies played a crucial role in desert life, not just for survival, but also as spaces for worship, community gatherings, and cultural expression.\n\nBoating on the lake gave a closer look at the structures scattered across the water—reminders of the city's glorious past. Gadisar Lake is not just a tourist spot; it’s a historical site that tells the story of sustainable living and the spiritual connection between nature and culture in Rajasthan’s desert heartland."

The lake exudes a tranquil and relaxing atmosphere, ideal for spending time with friends and family. There is also a Shiv Mandir nearby where you can receive blessings and enjoy a spiritual ambiance. Boating facilities are available, and the views from the boat are simply breathtaking, particularly at sunrise and sunset.\n\nWhen I arrived, there was a Teej Mela going on, which made the atmosphere bright and energetic. Due to the fair, the throng was large, but it added to the joyous atmosphere. There were various vendors selling traditional things, toys, local handicrafts, cuisine, and decorative items – ideal for those who enjoy shopping."

This magnificent palace, still partially serving as the residence of the royal family, transports visitors to a bygone era of Rajput grandeur.\n\nArchitectural Charm & Heritage\nThe exterior of Mandir Palace is a striking example of traditional **Rajputana architecture**, featuring ornately carved facades, jharokhas, and intricately designed archways. Its golden sandstone structure glows in the sunlight, making it a favorite for photography and heritage enthusiasts alike.\n\nInside, parts of the palace function as a **museum**, displaying a modest collection of royal artifacts, weapons, and historical relics. While not extensive, it provides a brief insight into Jaisalmer’s royal lineage.\n\n**rooftop view**—offering stunning panoramas of the **Jaisalmer Fort**, the Golden City, and the **Thar Desert**, especially at sunrise and sunset.\n\nVisiting Experience & Entry Fees\nMuseum comes at a fee of approximately **₹160–₹250**, with an additional **₹30** for mobile photography. While the architecture is beautiful, the **museum section is relatively small**, and some might find it underwhelming if expecting a large exhibit.\n\nOverall Impression\nMandir Palace / Badal Vilas is not just a structure—it's a **living piece of Jaisalmer's royal legacy**. While the museum might not justify the ticket price for every visitor, the architectural beauty, tranquil atmosphere, and regal charm still make it a **worthwhile stop**, especially for those interested in heritage and history."

The finely carved jharokhas, peaceful atmosphere, and the tall Badal Vilas tower offer a majestic view of the Golden City. Though the museum section is small, the charm of the palace and its rooftop views make it worth a visit.

Most of the doors are locked, and you’re not allowed to see the interior of many areas that are supposedly part of the tour.\n\nWhat made things worse was the rude and unprofessional behavior of the watchmen and staff. They were not helpful at all, and treated visitors with disrespect, which is completely unacceptable—especially at a historical or tourist site.\n\nThis place clearly survives on its name and heritage but doesn’t respect tourists or provide value for the money charged. Locals are not allowing to take photos from outside,I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone unless there are major improvements in how visitors are treated and what access is allowed."

We were also lucky enough to meet the founder of the museum who was lovely. It was also possible to buy puppets there for a very reasonable cost.\nWe were mainly going for the puppet show but the museum had some interesting\nartifacts and we spent about 30 minutes there.

That gesture itself is enough to understand how much they value the footfall.\nBecause of other popular tourist places in city like Jaisalmer, this goes as an unnoticed place to visit. However, after our experience at the puppet show and looking at the humbleness of artists, I must say this should be the point no 1 place to visit (it is very close to Gadisar lake). One, this kind of shows are dying in India and now few traces left here & there or in movies, or in text books or on YouTube. Two, artists feel so much empowered even for few claps that itself is a great experience. I recommend this culture museum and the puppet show to everyone who visit the Jaisalmer city. Take kids with you if you are with family as they need to see these shows, who knows when will these fade away.\nI would like to mention few names:\nMr Hemant Sharma who runs this museum and maintained it very well. The museum also offers some great art and things to shop.\nNext the artists group led by Mr Imamdin along with Rahul & Kalyan Bhat, they are great human beings & artists. Huge thanks to them for entertaining us whole heartedly. ❤️"

The venue itself is a treasure trove - a beautiful place that offers a unique blend of art, culture, and learning. The puppet show, bookshop, and museum all come together to create an immersive experience that's hard to find elsewhere.\nWhat really made the experience feel like home was the warm and welcoming nature of the staff, particularly the uncle and dadi ji who engaged with us in a way that felt like a conversation with family. Their passion and enthusiasm were infectious, and it added a personal touch to the entire experience.\nI would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique and enriching experience.

WiFi is totally pathetic. It works only on some areas, and that too sporadically.\n2. Would have been better to have an exhaust fan in the bathroom.\n3. Considering it’s a 4* hotel, would recommend having smart TV, so one can log on to Netflix etc."

              "reviewText": "It is one of the popular haveli in Jaisalmer. It is located right in the center of town where it's impossible to reach by car. Auto Riksha or walking was the only option. it was built in 19th century by Salim Singh, then Prime Minister of Jaisalmer. It is an excellent piece of Rajasthani architecture. Intricate carvings on walls and balconies are worth seeing. It's better to take a guided tour to understand the rich history behind it. It's open from  AM to 6 PM and entry fee is Rs.20 for Indians and 100 for foreigners."

The haveli’s design stands out with its creative structure and intricate detailing. You can feel the rich history in every corner, and the guides provide interesting stories and insights about Salim Singh and the legacy of this place. The view from the top is stunning, offering a great perspective of the golden city. Highly recommend visiting this historical gem"

              "reviewText": "Avoid This Place – Save Yourself from a Bad Experience\nJaisalmer is full of beauty and history, but visiting Salim Singh’s Haveli might be the only negative experience you have here.\n\nWhy would you even want to visit? The haveli is supposedly famous for its unique architecture—no cement construction—but now, there's visible cement work, ruining its original charm. In reality, it feels more like ruins than a heritage site. Just look at the pictures.\n\nIf you're feeling charitable, take the ticket and admire it from the outside. But do not go in, or you risk encountering the exceptionally rude guide. A review from two years ago already mentioned his attitude and unfortunately, nothing has changed—neither his behavior nor the neglected state of the place. Clearly, the owner isn't bothered.\n\nSkipping this place isn’t about saving the ₹100 (also 20 for taking pictures) entry fee. It’s about keeping your Jaisalmer memories positive. Do yourself a favor and visit other, better-preserved sites instead."

After paying 20rs for clicking pictures, when I started clicking pictures he stopped me saying that it is not allowed. I am confused for what did I pay those 20rs for.\nAnyways, I managed to click few pictures which will give you a clue on why to avoid this place.\nYou can better visit other places in Jaisalmer rather than wasting 100rs here. You can see this buidling from outside. 😊"

Exploring it feels like stepping back in time.\n\n✔️ Must-do:\n\nVisit during sunset for breathtaking golden hues.\n\nExplore Jain Temples (intricate carvings).\n\nWalk through the local markets for souvenirs.\n\nTry a rooftop café for city views.\n\n⚠️ Tips:\n\nWear comfortable footwear (lots of walking on stone paths).\n\nHire a local guide to know the hidden stories.\n\nEarly morning or evening visits are best to avoid heat.\n\nOverall, Jaisalmer Fort is a unique experience – a UNESCO World Heritage site where history, culture, and daily life blend seamlessly.

Built with yellow sandstone, the fort glows like gold under sunlight, which is why it’s called “Sonar Kila”. Its massive walls, intricate carvings, and royal gateways reflect the rich heritage and craftsmanship of Rajasthan.\n\nDuring my Jaisalmer visit, unfortunately, I couldn’t explore the fort from the inside due to time limitations, but I managed to capture some beautiful night-time photos from outside. The fort looks even more mesmerizing at night when it’s beautifully lit, creating a magical view.\n\nNext time, I definitely plan to explore the fort from inside, as it’s home to historic palaces, Jain temples, and vibrant markets. Even if you can’t go inside, I highly recommend visiting Sonar Kila at least once to witness its majestic beauty from the outside — it’s truly unforgettable!"
