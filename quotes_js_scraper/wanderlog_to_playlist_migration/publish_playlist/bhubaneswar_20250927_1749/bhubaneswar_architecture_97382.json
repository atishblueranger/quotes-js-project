I was fortunate to have a peaceful darshan and even got to touch the sacred Shivling, which felt spiritually powerful. Inside the complex, there are many smaller temples, each beautifully designed and adding to the divine atmosphere. One of the best parts is that mobile phones are not allowed inside, which keeps the environment calm and respectful. However, there's a dedicated viewpoint outside where visitors can take selfies and videos, which is a thoughtful addition. Overall, it's a must-visit spiritual destination in Bhubaneswar.",
