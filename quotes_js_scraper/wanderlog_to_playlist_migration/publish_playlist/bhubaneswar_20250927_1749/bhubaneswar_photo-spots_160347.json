Loved the greenery all around – it gives such a calm and refreshing vibe 🌿\n\nGot to see so many animals up close, especially the white tiger, which was amazing! 🐯 The safari was also a great experience – felt exciting to see animals roaming freely in that area. Definitely something different from the usual zoo experience.\n\nIt's a great spot to spend time with family or friends. There's boating too if you're into that kind of chill vibe 🚣‍♂️\n\nOverall, I'd totally recommend this place if you're in or around Bhubaneswar. Worth the visit 👍",

A superb experience. This was always on our to do list while going to Bhubhaneswar. The stupa is at a slight distance away from Bhubaneswar and is reachable by car.😍🤟🏻\nIt is a beautiful structure with the Buddha in different poses and it is very peaceful here., if you have extra time and you have interest in these types of monuments. No doubt it is very peaceful area.🫠💗 I would suggest to go in the evening time and enjoy the sun set over there. It will be very hot in the summer afternoon as you have to go without shoes.. View from the top is very good....🫶🏻😇",

Carved into solid rock, the twin hill structures hold centuries-old caves that once served as dwellings and meditation chambers for monks. These rock-cut marvels are not just architectural wonders but also sacred spaces that echo the deep roots of Jainism and its teachings in the region.\n\nThe caves are adorned with intricate carvings, inscriptions, and symbolic motifs that reflect the simplicity and discipline of monastic life. Each chamber tells a silent tale of devotion, enlightenment, and the human quest for inner peace. The cool interiors, despite the surrounding heat, offer a calming and reflective environment, inviting visitors to pause and connect with a timeless past.\n\nThe surrounding landscape adds to the charm - lush greenery, chirping birds, and panoramic views of the city from the hilltops create a perfect blend of history and natural beauty. Climbing the stone steps to explore each cave is like walking through the pages of a living history book. The serenity of the place makes it a favorite for spiritual seekers, historians, and nature lovers alike.\n\nWhat truly sets this site apart is its silent endurance through the ages. It continues to inspire with its blend of art, faith, and resilience. Whether it's a quiet sunrise visit or a thoughtful exploration of the caves, the experience leaves one with a deep appreciation for Odisha's ancient legacy and the peaceful strength of its spiritual traditions.",

The museum is well-organized and has amazing displays about nature, wildlife, and tribal life. One of the best parts is the life-size animal models, which make you feel like you're in a real jungle.\n\nThe museum has sections on different animals, birds, marine life, and even fossils. Seeing dinosaur fossils up close was really exciting! The tribal section teaches about how local communities live in harmony with nature. Everything is presented in a simple and interesting way, so both kids and adults can enjoy it.\n\nWhat I loved the most was how interactive and educational the museum is. There are plenty of things to learn, and it's a great place for school trips and families. Plus, the best part-it's completely free! The museum is well-maintained, and the staff is friendly.\n\nIf you are in Bhubaneswar and love nature or wildlife, this place is a must-visit. It's a peaceful and informative place where you can spend a couple of hours exploring and learning. Highly recommended for nature lovers, students, and anyone curious about the world around us!",

The prasad is served there.What I loved the most inside the temple was the idols of the deities-their decorations, their attire, and the positive vibes-they were truly wonderful.

The introduction of iron beams in construction and the first use of surasundaris (heavenly maidens) on temple walls make it a significant milestone in temple architecture.\n\nSurrounded by smaller shrines, Brahmeswar Temple's sanctum enshrines a powerful Shiva Lingam, drawing devotees and history lovers alike. The temple's rekha deul (curvilinear spire) and the exquisite nagara-style carvings tell stories of devotion, art, and cultural grandeur. Even after nearly a thousand years, it remains a serene and spiritual landmark in Bhubaneswar, the City of Temples.",

Built in the 9th century, the temple originally housed 64 Yogini idols, though only around 36 remain today, giving it its popular name. The intricate stone carvings, peaceful surroundings, and spiritual aura make it a fascinating spot for history enthusiasts and those seeking quiet reflection. Though not grand in size, the temple's distinct architecture and mystical charm leave a lasting impression. However, facilities around the site are minimal, so it's best visited as part of a short, well-planned heritage outing.",
