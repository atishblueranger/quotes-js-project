The architecture is truly stunning, showcasing intricate carvings and a deep sense of devotion. I was fortunate to have a peaceful darshan and even got to touch the sacred Shivling, which felt spiritually powerful. Inside the complex, there are many smaller temples, each beautifully designed and adding to the divine atmosphere. One of the best parts is that mobile phones are not allowed inside, which keeps the environment calm and respectful. However, there’s a dedicated viewpoint outside where visitors can take selfies and videos, which is a thoughtful addition. Overall, it’s a must-visit spiritual destination in Bhubaneswar."

Surroundings are kept very neat and clean. Security beefed up. I saw a very pleasant expressions on the faces of Devotees, coming out of the main shrine. But what made me most surprised was that the temple complex was kept in a heritage vibe. You would see it in through our age old prism and can not believe that you were within the beautiful and modern capital city of Bhubaneswar."

Daily rituals and festivals draw large crowds, and while prasad (offering) is served, it often involves a nominal fee for the meal.

They were very professional and highlighted all the defects in construction made by our Contractor and guided them with more efficient ways to construct.\nI would specially Thank Mr. Raja for his patience and updated knowledge in this field. His ideas are modern than the conventional plans given by architects in Bbsr.\nWhat Drew my attention towards this place was the lesser number of reviews given at Google, because the lesser the reviews the more genuine they sound as now a days every business just crowd their review page with fake reviews or paid reviews."

The founders Ar.Shanika and Ar.Nikhil ,both of them brought something unique to the table, and somehow, it just clicked. They balanced each other out in the best way and made the whole process easy and enjoyable. Their approach was both professional and personal — a rare combination.\n\nThey handled everything with care, from designing to material selection to supervision of execution. Their eye for detail and genuine effort to understand my needs truly impressed me. They weren’t just service providers; they were partners in the process.\n\nHaving a dedicated supervisor (Das babu) from them towards the end ensured flawless execution and made the finishing stage stress-free. I’m grateful for their commitment and would wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone who wants to build their residential or commercial projects."

Carved into solid rock, the twin hill structures hold centuries-old caves that once served as dwellings and meditation chambers for monks. These rock-cut marvels are not just architectural wonders but also sacred spaces that echo the deep roots of Jainism and its teachings in the region.\n\nThe caves are adorned with intricate carvings, inscriptions, and symbolic motifs that reflect the simplicity and discipline of monastic life. Each chamber tells a silent tale of devotion, enlightenment, and the human quest for inner peace. The cool interiors, despite the surrounding heat, offer a calming and reflective environment, inviting visitors to pause and connect with a timeless past.\n\nThe surrounding landscape adds to the charm — lush greenery, chirping birds, and panoramic views of the city from the hilltops create a perfect blend of history and natural beauty. Climbing the stone steps to explore each cave is like walking through the pages of a living history book. The serenity of the place makes it a favorite for spiritual seekers, historians, and nature lovers alike.\n\nWhat truly sets this site apart is its silent endurance through the ages. It continues to inspire with its blend of art, faith, and resilience. Whether it's a quiet sunrise visit or a thoughtful exploration of the caves, the experience leaves one with a deep appreciation for Odisha’s ancient legacy and the peaceful strength of its spiritual traditions."

The udayagiri caves have less climbing but Khandagiri you have to climb a lot of stairs we didn't go to Khandagiri. It's recommended to come in the morning as it's very hot at noon.

Then view from Khandgiri top was just amazing😍  The temple on Udaygiri was beautiful too. You will enjoy the hiking part inspite of hard hiking. Shere are budget friendly shops at the bottom of those hills where you can get food of drinks at regular price.\nTicket prices were Rs.25 per Indian person, and 300 per person for foreigners only.\nIf you have severe injury in legs or joint pain then avoid these. Because even the stairs are too steep."

There are numismatics, epigraphy, manuscripts, armoury, library, arts and crafts, mining and geology, natural history and anthropology, also there is The Kalinga Art Gallery, where you can look at the masterpieces of the artists all over the Odisha. The Odisha State Museum holds a lot of collections including The Kalinga Art Gallery over a two storey building in Kalpana Chowk, Bhubaneswar. I got to learn a lot about the rich culture of our Odisha. The ticket prices for each adult and child below 10 years are ₹20 and ₹10 respectively. Also you have to pay ₹10 extra for photography. Everyone must visit this place once in their life time including school children, because they ll get to know many more new things and rich heritage and culture about our state Odisha."

It's not just a great spot for families, but also a standout zoo in India due to its strong focus on conservation and its beautiful natural setting. While a few small tweaks to maintenance and crowd management could make the experience even better, its unique qualities make it a must-see destination.\n* Timings: The park is open from 7:30 AM to 5:30 PM from April to September and from 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM from October to March. Please note, it is closed on Mondays."

Loved the greenery all around – it gives such a calm and refreshing vibe 🌿\n\nGot to see so many animals up close, especially the white tiger, which was amazing! 🐯 The safari was also a great experience – felt exciting to see animals roaming freely in that area. Definitely something different from the usual zoo experience.\n\nIt’s a great spot to spend time with family or friends. There’s boating too if you’re into that kind of chill vibe 🚣‍♂️\n\nOverall, I’d totally recommend this place if you’re in or around Bhubaneswar. Worth the visit 👍"

              "reviewText": "Nandankanan Zoological Park, nestled 10 km from Bhubaneswar, spans a lush 437 hectares combining zoo, botanical garden, and wildlife sanctuary. Home to 157 species and over 3,500 animals including rare white tigers, gharials, and pangolins it’s India’s first WAZA-accredited zoo.\n\nEntry is ₹50 for adults, ₹10 for children, and ₹100 for foreigners. Safaris (lion, white tiger, bear, herbivore) cost ₹30/₹15, while paddle-boat rides range from ₹50 to ₹150. A toy train and battery vehicles are also available, though small boat and safari queues occur during peak times. We paid 1500 for 3 people all with guide. It's take 3 -3.5 hrs entire park. Later depends upon you how much you spend.\n\nVisit early morning (7:30 AM) or late afternoon for optimal wildlife viewing; winters (Oct–Mar) are best.\nThe park is well-maintained, clean, and family-friendly, with a botanical garden, aquarium, library, and picnic spots.\nHowever, avoid hiring overpriced guides many reviews advise self-guided exploration or using the battery vehicle to comfortably cover the large grounds. Overall, Nandankanan offers an enriching, educational, and enjoyable experience for wildlife lovers."

The entry ticket is very reasonably priced at just ₹50 per person, and it's absolutely worth every rupee for the experience you get. One of the highlights of the visit was taking the Pack Auto Taxi Tour, which costs ₹800 per head. It provides a comfortable and informative guided tour around the vast park area—perfect if you're visiting with family or prefer not to walk the entire distance.\n\nThe zoo is home to a diverse range of animals and birds. I saw majestic white tigers, lions, leopards, elephants, rhinoceroses, giraffes, zebras, crocodiles, and hippopotamuses. For bird lovers, there's an impressive aviary with species like peacocks, parrots, hornbills, emus, ostriches, and many more colorful and exotic birds.\n\nThe zoo is clean, well-maintained, and the animals appear to be well cared for. There's ample space, shaded areas to rest, and food stalls for snacks and refreshments. Also, the adjoining botanical garden and lake add to the scenic beauty of the place.\n\nHighly recommended for a day out with friends or family, especially if you're a nature or wildlife enthusiast. Can't wait to visit again!"

You can see a beautiful scenery....😇👍🏻\nAnd Daya River is clear from this point. A beautiful monument, Dhauli Shanti Stupa lures you with its grandeur, serene atmosphere & beautiful views. A superb experience. This was always on our to do list while going to Bhubhaneswar. The stupa is at a slight distance away from Bhubaneswar and is reachable by car.😍🤟🏻\nIt is a beautiful structure with the Buddha in different poses and it is very peaceful here., if you have extra time and you have interest in these types of monuments. No doubt it is very peaceful area.🫠💗 I would suggest to go in the evening time and enjoy the sun set over there. It will be very hot in the summer afternoon as you have to go without shoes.. View from the top is very good....🫶🏻😇"

Better to visit in the evening as u can witness the sound and light show. We went in the afternoon and it was very exhausting. There are no good eateries nearby better to eat from town and come here. You can get light snacks and refreshing drinks. Senior citizens need extra care while coming here."

              "reviewText": "The Dhauli Shanti Stupa, located near Bhubaneswar in Odisha, holds great historical and spiritual significance. It is believed to be the site of the Kalinga War (261 BCE), where Emperor Ashoka witnessed massive bloodshed that changed his heart. Deeply moved, Ashoka renounced violence and embraced Buddhism, spreading messages of peace and compassion. The Japanese Buddhist Sangha later built the white Peace Pagoda (Shanti Stupa) here in 1972, symbolizing harmony and non-violence. Surrounded by ancient rock edicts of Ashoka and serene landscapes, Dhauli Shanti Stupa stands as a reminder of transformation, peace, and the universal message of brotherhood.\n\nExperience: Not much to explore, but it is a peaceful and pleasant place to visit. The four statues of Buddha each depict a story. I am not sure if private vehicles are allowed near the temple, as we traveled there on a small government bus.\n\nThe four Buddha statues at Dhauli Shanti Stupa (Peace Pagoda), Odisha represent the four significant stages of Lord Buddha’s life. Each statue is placed facing one direction of the stupa, symbolizing peace and compassion:\n\nBirth of Buddha (Lumbini) – Depicts the moment of Siddhartha Gautama’s birth.\n\nEnlightenment (Bodh Gaya) – Represents Buddha attaining enlightenment under the Bodhi tree.\n\nFirst Sermon (Sarnath) – Symbolizes the \"Dharmachakra Pravartan\" (Turning of the Wheel of Dharma) when he first taught the path.\n\nMahaparinirvana (Kushinagar) – Depicts Buddha’s final departure from the world, symbolizing eternal peace.\n\nThese statues together narrate Buddha’s journey and convey the message of non-violence, compassion, and universal peace."

The moment you step up to it, there’s a real sense of calm in the air - something about the white domed structure against the sky just puts your heart at ease.\n\nThe stupa itself is a beauty - gracefully built, with stunning carvings and elegant depictions of Lord Buddha in various postures. You don’t have to be deeply spiritual to feel the stillness of the place. It’s peaceful in a way that makes you want to just sit, take a breath, and let the world slow down a bit.\n\nFrom the top, you get a sweeping view of the Daya River flowing gently through the landscape - absolutely cracking at sunset, when the whole place is bathed in gold. Mind you, in the heat of the afternoon, it can get a bit much, especially since shoes have to come off - so aim for an evening visit if you can.\n\nIt’s free to enter, easy to reach by car, and honestly, it’s well worth the short drive out from the city. Whether you’re into history, architecture, or just fancy a peaceful moment with a view, Dhauli’s a spot that’ll stay with you."

We understand:\nFor legends live in every land.\nBut he — he made the stars his own,\nIn skies of blue, his light is shown.\n\nSo now we stand, though time has flown,\nWith courage carved into our bone,\nAnd whisper still with heads held high:\n“To Biju, who dared to touch the sky.”"

Unlike most temples, it houses no deity; it's called a \"love temple\" due to its sensual sculptures of couples, dancers, and celestial beings adorning every wall.\n\nThe temple’s layout features a soaring central spire (vimana) around 18 m high and a pyramidal jagamohana, showcasing fine craftsmanship and mini-spires reminiscent of Khajuraho. Positioned in a well-kept garden, it offers a peaceful retreat within the city.\n\nOpen daily from 6:30 AM to 7:30 PM, a nominal entry fee of ₹20 pay online for Indians and ₹250 for foreigners goes toward upkeep ). The annual Rajarani Music Festival held here in January–February adds cultural charm.\n\nWhile interior maintenance could improve—some visitors note dim lighting and occasional bats—the temple’s artistic finesse and serene setting make it a must-visit for architecture and heritage enthusiasts."

A few improvements could make it even better: the seats could be upgraded for more comfort, and the AC, while effective, was a bit too cold and could be adjusted for a more ambient temperature. The projectors could use an upgrade for sharper visuals, and the screen clarity could also be improved. Introducing 3D shows would be a great addition too! Overall, a good place to learn and explore."

              "reviewText": "The Pathani Samanta Planetarium in Bhubaneswar offers an enriching experience for anyone interested in astronomy and space. The planetarium is a testament to the dedication of its team, presenting an impressive array of videos about the sky and space. These shows, played in Odia, Hindi, and English, cater to a diverse audience with four different timings to choose from. The informative and engaging content provides a fascinating glimpse into the wonders of the universe, making it a fantastic educational outing for both adults and children. The ticket prices are quite reasonable, with adults paying 30 rupees and children under 15 paying just 20 rupees. However, the experience was somewhat marred by the fact that half of the screen was not functioning during the show. This technical issue detracted from the overall immersive experience and was a disappointment considering the otherwise high quality of the presentations. Despite this setback, the planetarium remains a valuable resource for learning and exploration. The affordability and the range of languages offered make it accessible to a broad audience, but it is hoped that the screen issue will be addressed soon to enhance the viewing experience further. Overall, it is a commendable effort that provides significant educational value to its visitors."

It took us more than 1hour to completely explore exery corner. Main temple was huge.

              "reviewText": "A Magnificent Journey into Kalinga's Heart, with a Word of Caution\nStanding as the magnificent soul of Bhubaneswar, the \"Temple City of India,\" the Lingaraj Temple is an architectural marvel and a spiritual behemoth. My recent visit was a journey back in time, a sensory experience filled with awe, devotion, and a slight touch of modern-day reality.\nA Glimpse into History\nBefore you even step inside, the temple's history looms as large as its towering spire. Built in the 11th century by King Jajati Keshari of the Somavamsi dynasty, Lingaraj Temple is the quintessential example of Kalinga architecture in its full maturity. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva as Harihara – a unique form that represents the syncretism of Shaivism (Shiva) and Vaishnavism (Vishnu). The central deity is a Swayambhu (self-manifested) lingam, which is considered incredibly sacred. The sprawling complex, with its 50-odd smaller shrines, is a testament to centuries of faith and masterful craftsmanship.\nThe Awe-Inspiring Experience\nThe moment you pass through the main gate, the sheer scale of the main sanctum's tower (Vimana), soaring to a height of 180 feet, is breathtaking. The intricate carvings that adorn every inch of the sandstone structure are a sight to behold. Deities, celestial beings, mythical creatures, and floral patterns tell a thousand stories etched in stone. The atmosphere inside is thick with spirituality; the air is filled with the fragrance of incense, ghee lamps, and flowers, accompanied by the continuous murmur of chants and ringing bells. The feeling of being in a living, breathing place of worship that has been active for a thousand years is truly profound.\nThe Dissonance: Where Commerce Meets Piety\nHowever, this sublime spiritual experience was unfortunately marred by a very worldly issue. As I neared the inner sanctum (Garbhagriha) to get a glimpse of the deity, the commercial aspect of the temple became glaringly apparent. A number of pujaris (priests) were quite insistent, bordering on aggressive, in directing devotees towards special pujas.\nMy personal experience was a bit disheartening. I was approached and told that for a proper blessing and prasad, a special puja was necessary. The price quoted was a staggering ₹2000. When I politely declined, expressing my desire for just a simple darshan, the attitude soured. This transactional nature of worship felt deeply out of place within such a sacred space. It creates an uncomfortable environment, making one feel that blessings are conditional on payment, which goes against the very grain of spiritual seeking. For a pilgrim who comes with pure devotion, this can be a very jarring and disappointing experience.\nFinal Verdict\nThe Lingaraj Temple is, without a doubt, an unmissable destination. Its architectural grandeur and historical significance are unparalleled. It is a masterpiece that every history, art, and architecture enthusiast must see.\nHowever, visitors should be prepared for the commercial pressures within. My advice would be to be firm yet polite. You are not obligated to pay for any special puja to receive blessings. Go for the divine art, the palpable history, and the spiritual aura. But be prepared for the very human commerce that operates within its sacred walls. It is a magnificent monument, but one where you must navigate the material to experience the spiritual.\nKey Tips for Visitors:\n* No Cameras or Phones: They are strictly prohibited inside. You can deposit them at a locker outside for a small fee.\n* Dress Code: Modest attire is required. Cover your shoulders and knees.\n* Entry: Please note that only Hindus are permitted to enter the temple premises. Others can get a decent view from a viewing platform built nearby."

The wall is 7.5 ft (2.3 m) thick and surmounted by a plain slant coping. Alongside the inner face of the boundary wall, there is a terrace to protect the compound wall against outside aggression. The tower is 45.11 m (148.0 ft) high and the complex has 150 smaller shrines in its spacious courtyard. Each inch of the 55 m (180 ft) tall tower is sculpted. The door in the gate of the entrance porch is made of sandalwood.\nThe temple has a vast courtyard mired with hundreds of small shrines.\n\nOther significant areas are\n\nThe Bhogamandapa (Hall of offering)\nThe Natyamandira (festival hall)\nThe jagamohana (assembly hall)\n\nAs per Hindu legend, an underground river originating from the Lingaraja temple fills the Bindusagar Tank (meaning ocean drop) and the water is believed to heal physical and spiritual illness. The water from the tank is thus treated sacred and pilgrims take a holy dip during festive occasions\n\nTime Required 2Hrs\nTickets Required plus need to deposit Cell Phone & allied as no photocopy allowed.\nMust Visit\nPreetam, ✨"

Will definitely appreciate its impressive architectural grandeur and deep spiritual significance.\n\nIt has magnificent Kalinga-style architecture with its towering spire, intricate carvings, and numerous shrines within the complex. The carvings depict scenes from Hindu mythology and reflect the artistry of the Kalinga dynasty. Me and my family felt a powerful and positive spiritual energy within the temple complex, especially when touching the sacred Shivling. The temple offers a serene and peaceful environment for devotees seeking blessings and inner tranquility.\n\nThe temple dates back to the 11th century and represents Odisha's rich heritage and architectural prowess. It's considered a significant landmark symbolizing the coexistence of Shaivism and Vaishnavism. The temple's large Shivalinga, the Maha Bhog Kitchen where food is cooked traditionally, and the Bindusagar tank (believed to have healing waters).\n\nDuring festivals and auspicious days, the temple can get very crowded, impacting the ease of darshan (viewing the deity). One problem is cleanliness within the main temple and the area where offerings are consumed. Photography, mobile phones, bags, shoes, and leather items are strictly prohibited inside the temple premises. A dedicated area is provided outside for depositing these items.\n\nOverall, a visit to this temple is a must for anyone seeking a glimpse into the rich cultural heritage."

Inside the park, you’ll also find a Koraput Coffee outlet that offers coffee, millet cookies, and millet cake at reasonable prices.\n\nEntry Fees:\n\nCar Parking: ₹40\n\nAdults: ₹40\n\nChildren: ₹15"

Inspite of Monsoon the grounds were well trimmed.\nA lot of place and rides for kids to play and enjoy. The newly made Cactus House is a delight to watch. Have never seen so many varieties of Cactuses in one place.\n\nThe biggest flaw of the place is no Information inside. Again a similar flaw that I notice is Bhubaneswar tourist sites. We didn’t know where is what. There is no information about the biodiversity there. These are places from which visitors could learn a lot. It’s an amazingly built place with so much of knowledge. They should install information decks. Much required. Very cheap to enter and enjoy. If you traveling with kids, remember that Food is not allowed inside."

Spanning an impressive 487–500 acres, this verdant haven is managed by the Regional Plant Resource Centre and has been a city landmark since its founding in 1985  ￼.\n\nAs you wander through its diverse landscapes, you encounter several distinct zones. The highlight is the Cactus Garden, covering around 100 acres, featuring over 1,000 succulent and cactus varieties in a striking pyramid-style glasshouse  ￼. Nearby, themed flower gardens—scented flowers, hibiscus, and a vast rose garden—showcase hundreds of plant species, enhancing both your senses and Instagram feed  ￼.\n\nA serene 40-acre artificial lake lies at the heart of the garden. Visitors can enjoy & simply admire the migratory birdlife, especially during winter  ￼. A nearby birdwatching tower offers panoramic views of the lake and surrounding greenery  ￼.\n\nFamilies love the children’s play zone with swings, slides, and a musical fountain—sure to delight younger guests  ￼. Natural walking trails, built for morning and evening fitness routines, thread through woodland scenery, connecting visitors with the adjacent Chandaka forest  ￼.\n\nAmenities bolster the visitor experience: thoughtful walking trails (3 km), well-kept benches, restrooms, drinking water stations, and on-site stalls offering local handicrafts and light refreshments  ￼. The park’s popularity surges during the annual January flower show, a vibrant showcase of horticultural skills ."

The museum is well-organized and has amazing displays about nature, wildlife, and tribal life. One of the best parts is the life-size animal models, which make you feel like you're in a real jungle.\n\nThe museum has sections on different animals, birds, marine life, and even fossils. Seeing dinosaur fossils up close was really exciting! The tribal section teaches about how local communities live in harmony with nature. Everything is presented in a simple and interesting way, so both kids and adults can enjoy it.\n\nWhat I loved the most was how interactive and educational the museum is. There are plenty of things to learn, and it’s a great place for school trips and families. Plus, the best part—it’s completely free! The museum is well-maintained, and the staff is friendly.\n\nIf you are in Bhubaneswar and love nature or wildlife, this place is a must-visit. It’s a peaceful and informative place where you can spend a couple of hours exploring and learning. Highly recommended for nature lovers, students, and anyone curious about the world around us!"

Students from various schools were invited to take part in this well-structured and thoughtfully curated program.\n\nFrom day one, the camp was filled with excitement and learning. The organizers did a fantastic job of balancing educational activities with creative and recreational ones. Children engaged in sessions on wildlife and environmental awareness, participated in art, dance, and music, and even went on two educational picnics that brought learning to life in a fun and interactive way.\n\nThe RMNH team showed incredible dedication, ensuring that every child felt cared for, engaged, and inspired. The camp concluded on June 5, aligning beautifully with World Environment Day, with a special valedictory program, where students were awarded certificates recognizing their active involvement and achievements during the summer program week.\n\nA big thank you to the entire team at RMNH, Bhubaneswar for creating such a memorable and impactful experience. I truly hope my kids get the opportunity to be a part of this incredible camp again next year!!"

              "reviewText": "Indian art consists of a variety of art forms, including painting, sculpture, pottery, and textile arts such as woven silk. Geographically, it spans the entire Indian subcontinent, including what is now India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and eastern Afghanistan. A strong sense of design is characteristic of Indian art and can be observed in its modern and traditional forms.\nThe origin of Indian art can be traced to pre-historic settlements in the 3rd millennium BC. On its way to modern times, Indian art has had cultural influences, as well as religious influences such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and Islam. In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups.\nIn historic art, sculpture in stone and metal, mainly religious, has survived the Indian climate better than other media and provides most of the best remains. Many of the most important ancient finds that are not in carved stone come from the surrounding, drier regions rather than India itself. Indian funeral and philosophic traditions exclude grave goods, which is the main source of ancient art in other cultures.\nIndian artist styles historically followed Indian religions out of the subcontinent, having an especially large influence in Tibet, South East Asia and China. Indian art has itself received influences at times, especially from Central Asia and Iran, and Europe."

I have visited this park quite a few times and there is always an ice-cream guy & a panipuri guy outside the park. The park is well spacious, very friendly for walks, adults and teenagers. It normally would take 15-18 mins for a complete walk.\n\nAlthough won’t suggest going there, extra late nights since it gets a little darker but the perfect time would be the evenings.\n\nPeople living nearby should visit this place at least once! 💯"

The poor lighting and the absence of boundary wall on the one side of the park have only made matters worse.\n\nEstablished in 1998, the park once had grand plans for installing a statue of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose with a fountain around it. Now the entire area is covered with wild bushes with venomous snakes hiding here and there.\n\nMd Sarfaz Alam, an electrical contractor who lives in the area, said that such is the fear of snakes that people don’t dare to enter the park during summer and the rainy season. The gates of the park remain closed almost always and the only security man guarding the place has not received his salary for the past two years. “The park opens according to his whims,” Alam added. etc. provide added beauty to the park. Large benches are placed throughout theThe park is one of the famous visitor spots of the capital town of Bhubaneswar. The park is adorned in a lovely manner. The pathways, light systems, strolling tracks, sprinklers and so on. Offer added beauty to the park.As the Bhubaneswar Development Authority (BDA), which is tasked with the management and maintenance of the park, apparently seems to be not interested in performing its duties, the nearby slumdwellers let their cattle lose into the park through the open boundary.\n\nAdmitting that the park was suffering on account of indifference, the official said that some of the installations like fountains had stopped working as repairs did not take place on time.\n\nLarge benches are located for the duration of the park to permit human beings sit and revel in the environment of the park. The clean air of the vicinity mixed with the desirable greenery could make all and sundry’s coronary heart wander and force him to stay lower back a touch longer inside the park. Every day loads of nearby people and travelers go to the park to have a chilled time. Children also love to be at this beautiful park. The park’s timing is 4.00 PM to 8.00 PM & 5.00 AM to 8.00 AM day by day."

As kids, we might have run around its open grounds, enjoying the simple pleasure of space in a developing city. Even now, it remains a popular spot for morning walks and evening strolls, offering a breath of fresh air away from the urban bustle.\nThe park is dedicated to Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose, a towering figure in India's independence movement, and it's a fitting tribute. The well-maintained pathways, the trees providing shade, and the benches scattered around offer a peaceful environment to reflect and perhaps remember his contributions. The gentle lighting in the evenings adds to its charm.\nHowever, Janta Maidan's identity extends beyond just being a park. It's the city's go-to venue for large-scale events. I've attended numerous trade fairs, cultural melas (like the Toshali Mela), and exhibitions here over the years. During these events, the atmosphere transforms completely. The grounds come alive with vibrant stalls, bustling crowds, and the sounds of commerce and celebration. It's a place where you can find everything from traditional handicrafts and handlooms to the latest consumer goods. The annual India International Mega Trade Fair is a particularly big draw.\nIt's interesting how this space seamlessly transitions between a tranquil park for daily recreation and a dynamic hub for major city events. This versatility makes Janta Maidan a truly important and recognizable place in Bhubaneswar. While it might not have elaborate landscaping or amusement rides like some other parks, its open expanse and its role as a central event ground give it a unique character and a special place in the hearts of the locals. We see it not just as a park, but as a vital part of Bhubaneswar's social and cultural fabric."

Built in 1058 CE by Kolavati Devi, the mother of Somavamsi king Udyotakesari, this temple marks an important transition in temple design, showcasing intricate craftsmanship and artistic excellence.\n\nCarved out of sandstone, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and features breathtaking sculptures of celestial dancers, musicians, and mythological figures. The introduction of iron beams in construction and the first use of surasundaris (heavenly maidens) on temple walls make it a significant milestone in temple architecture.\n\nSurrounded by smaller shrines, Brahmeswar Temple’s sanctum enshrines a powerful Shiva Lingam, drawing devotees and history lovers alike. The temple’s rekha deul (curvilinear spire) and the exquisite nagara-style carvings tell stories of devotion, art, and cultural grandeur. Even after nearly a thousand years, it remains a serene and spiritual landmark in Bhubaneswar, the City of Temples."

Built in Kalinga-style architecture, it features an elaborate rekha deula (tower) and intricate carvings of divine figures, musicians, and dancers. The temple marks the transition to more elaborate Odishan temple designs, influencing later structures like Lingaraj Temple.

Situated about 10 km from the city center, it is easily accessible by taxis, auto-rickshaws, and local buses, making it a must-visit heritage site."

I loved just strolling around, it has such a lovely, relaxed vibe. The way they've designed the stalls like little village huts gives it so much character.\nI spent ages Browse the handicrafts – the Pattachitra paintings are simply stunning, and I picked up some beautiful handloom fabric. It's so cool to see the artisans actually demonstrating their skills right there. You feel like you're getting a genuine piece of art, directly from the person who made it.\nAnd the food! Oh my goodness, the food stalls are a must-try. I indulged in some delicious local Odia snacks that I still think about.\nIt's a fantastic spot for souvenirs, or just to soak in some local culture. Highly recommend a visit, whether you're a tourist or a local looking for something unique. Definitely brings a smile to your face!"

Located near Ekamra Kanan, this open-air marketplace is a treat for art enthusiasts, shopaholics, and food lovers alike. The haat is a perfect blend of tradition and modernity, offering a variety of handcrafted items, textiles, and souvenirs that reflect the skilled craftsmanship of local artisans. From intricate Pattachitra paintings to Sambalpuri sarees and terracotta artifacts, the collection is diverse and authentic.\n\nThe ambience of Akamra Haat is equally captivating, with its neatly designed stalls, open spaces, and a festive vibe. Regularly hosting cultural events, including dance and music performances, it adds an engaging experience for visitors, giving them a taste of Odisha’s cultural essence. The food stalls serving local delicacies such as dahi bara aloo dum, chakuli pitha, and rasagola are an added delight.\n\nOne of the highlights is its affordability, making it an excellent destination for both tourists and locals. However, parking can be challenging during peak hours, and the area can get crowded during festivals. Overall, Akamra Haat is a must-visit destination for anyone looking to immerse themselves in Odisha’s cultural and artistic richness."

I will list out some good facts and few not so good facts:\n\nGood facts:\n1. This is a huge place. With a large pond inside it. The name itself suffices, a lot of trees around.\n2. If you are in Bhubaneswar and on a weekend if you plan to get away from the city life and be with nature for few hours, this is definitely the place.\n3. The entire garden is very well maintained and there are lots of areas and parks inside that you can witness.\n4. There is a butterfly garden which is a bit inside, is perhaps the best place to click photographs.\n5. The overall scenic beauty is very pleasant.\n6. You will definitely feel after relaxed coming here.\n\nFact to note:\nIf you are planning to visit the garden by foot, plan it for a couple of hours as its quite a big place. It might be tiring for some depending on your physique."

It's a beautifully maintained place full of lush greenery, rare plant species, and peaceful walking trails. The air is fresh, the surroundings are calm, and it's the perfect spot for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts.\n\nThe layout is well-planned with informative signboards and shaded resting spots. I especially enjoyed the cactus house and medicinal plant section — both educational and fascinating.\n\nGreat place for families, couples, or solo visitors looking to spend a quiet and refreshing day. Kudos to the staff for keeping the garden so clean and well-preserved!\n\n🌳 Highly recommend visiting if you're in Bhubaneswar! 🌳"

The surroundings are scenic and ideal for a relaxed stroll or a family outing.\n\nHowever, the maintenance could be better in some areas, and a few parts of the garden felt a bit neglected. Also, not all facilities were fully functional during my visit, which was a little disappointing. Despite that, it’s still a nice place if you enjoy nature and want to explore something different within Bhubaneswar. Worth a one-time visit, especially if you’re already at the zoo nearby."

Carved into solid rock, the twin hill structures hold centuries-old caves that once served as dwellings and meditation chambers for monks. These rock-cut marvels are not just architectural wonders but also sacred spaces that echo the deep roots of Jainism and its teachings in the region.\n\nThe caves are adorned with intricate carvings, inscriptions, and symbolic motifs that reflect the simplicity and discipline of monastic life. Each chamber tells a silent tale of devotion, enlightenment, and the human quest for inner peace. The cool interiors, despite the surrounding heat, offer a calming and reflective environment, inviting visitors to pause and connect with a timeless past.\n\nThe surrounding landscape adds to the charm — lush greenery, chirping birds, and panoramic views of the city from the hilltops create a perfect blend of history and natural beauty. Climbing the stone steps to explore each cave is like walking through the pages of a living history book. The serenity of the place makes it a favorite for spiritual seekers, historians, and nature lovers alike.\n\nWhat truly sets this site apart is its silent endurance through the ages. It continues to inspire with its blend of art, faith, and resilience. Whether it's a quiet sunrise visit or a thoughtful exploration of the caves, the experience leaves one with a deep appreciation for Odisha’s ancient legacy and the peaceful strength of its spiritual traditions."

Shere are budget friendly shops at the bottom of those hills where you can get food of drinks at regular price.\nTicket prices were Rs.25 per Indian person, and 300 per person for foreigners only.\nIf you have severe injury in legs or joint pain then avoid these.

Home to 157 species and over 3,500 animals including rare white tigers, gharials, and pangolins it’s India’s first WAZA-accredited zoo.\n\nEntry is ₹50 for adults, ₹10 for children, and ₹100 for foreigners. Safaris (lion, white tiger, bear, herbivore) cost ₹30/₹15, while paddle-boat rides range from ₹50 to ₹150. A toy train and battery vehicles are also available, though small boat and safari queues occur during peak times. We paid 1500 for 3 people all with guide. It's take 3 -3.5 hrs entire park. Later depends upon you how much you spend.\n\nVisit early morning (7:30 AM) or late afternoon for optimal wildlife viewing; winters (Oct–Mar) are best.\nThe park is well-maintained, clean, and family-friendly, with a botanical garden, aquarium, library, and picnic spots.\nHowever, avoid hiring overpriced guides many reviews advise self-guided exploration or using the battery vehicle to comfortably cover the large grounds. Overall, Nandankanan offers an enriching, educational, and enjoyable experience for wildlife lovers."

The entry ticket is very reasonably priced at just ₹50 per person, and it's absolutely worth every rupee for the experience you get. One of the highlights of the visit was taking the Pack Auto Taxi Tour, which costs ₹800 per head. It provides a comfortable and informative guided tour around the vast park area—perfect if you're visiting with family or prefer not to walk the entire distance.\n\nThe zoo is home to a diverse range of animals and birds. I saw majestic white tigers, lions, leopards, elephants, rhinoceroses, giraffes, zebras, crocodiles, and hippopotamuses. For bird lovers, there's an impressive aviary with species like peacocks, parrots, hornbills, emus, ostriches, and many more colorful and exotic birds.\n\nThe zoo is clean, well-maintained, and the animals appear to be well cared for. There's ample space, shaded areas to rest, and food stalls for snacks and refreshments. Also, the adjoining botanical garden and lake add to the scenic beauty of the place.\n\nHighly recommended for a day out with friends or family, especially if you're a nature or wildlife enthusiast. Can't wait to visit again!"

The Chausath Yogini Temple in Hirapur is a rare 9th-century circular shrine, dedicated to 64 divine Yoginis—feminine energies of Tantra. Its open-air, roofless design instantly sets it apart from other temples, creating a serene, mystical atmosphere that’s perfect for quiet reflection and spiritual connection.\n\nThe intricate stone carvings and powerful goddess statues, many still beautifully preserved, echo the temple’s profound heritage. You’ll notice each Yogini depicted in unique poses and expressions, symbolizing the diversity and strength of the feminine divine. The narrow, low entrance adds a sense of awe as you step into this sacred mandala.\n\nAlthough modest in size, the temple’s peaceful ambiance, artistry, and deeply rooted history make it a must-visit for anyone interested in Odisha’s unique cultural and spiritual legacy. The entire site is well-maintained, and its aura feels far removed from the noise of the city. Highly recommended for seekers of art, history, or tranquil places to meditate and feel inspired by ancient wisdom."

Carved intricately from stone, the temple reflects the unmatched craftsmanship of ancient artisans. Every wall, pillar, and sculpture speaks a silent story from centuries past, showcasing depictions of gods, celestial beings, animals, and mythological scenes with breathtaking detail and symmetry.\n\nThe temple’s towering spire reaches towards the sky, symbolizing a bridge between the earth and the divine. As sunlight falls upon its surfaces, the carvings come alive with shadows and light, creating a magical atmosphere that enchants every visitor. The structure is not just a place of worship, but also a remarkable example of engineering and design from an era where tools were limited but imagination was boundless.\n\nSurrounded by natural beauty and calmness, the temple complex often fills with the soft sounds of bells, chants, and the fragrance of incense. Pilgrims and tourists alike are drawn to its aura — seeking blessings, inner peace, or simply to witness the marvel of its existence. The spiritual energy around it is powerful, yet deeply comforting.\n\nDespite the passage of time, the temple remains well-preserved, echoing the glory of a bygone civilization that valued devotion, art, and architectural excellence. Whether one is religious or not, standing in the shadow of this grand monument stirs a deep respect for history and heritage. It is a living relic of faith, devotion, and timeless cultural pride."

The museum is well-organized and has amazing displays about nature, wildlife, and tribal life. One of the best parts is the life-size animal models, which make you feel like you're in a real jungle.\n\nThe museum has sections on different animals, birds, marine life, and even fossils. Seeing dinosaur fossils up close was really exciting! The tribal section teaches about how local communities live in harmony with nature. Everything is presented in a simple and interesting way, so both kids and adults can enjoy it.\n\nWhat I loved the most was how interactive and educational the museum is. There are plenty of things to learn, and it’s a great place for school trips and families. Plus, the best part—it’s completely free! The museum is well-maintained, and the staff is friendly.\n\nIf you are in Bhubaneswar and love nature or wildlife, this place is a must-visit. It’s a peaceful and informative place where you can spend a couple of hours exploring and learning. Highly recommended for nature lovers, students, and anyone curious about the world around us!"

Students from various schools were invited to take part in this well-structured and thoughtfully curated program.\n\nFrom day one, the camp was filled with excitement and learning. The organizers did a fantastic job of balancing educational activities with creative and recreational ones. Children engaged in sessions on wildlife and environmental awareness, participated in art, dance, and music, and even went on two educational picnics that brought learning to life in a fun and interactive way.\n\nThe RMNH team showed incredible dedication, ensuring that every child felt cared for, engaged, and inspired. The camp concluded on June 5, aligning beautifully with World Environment Day, with a special valedictory program, where students were awarded certificates recognizing their active involvement and achievements during the summer program week.\n\nA big thank you to the entire team at RMNH, Bhubaneswar for creating such a memorable and impactful experience. I truly hope my kids get the opportunity to be a part of this incredible camp again next year!!"

You can see a beautiful scenery....😇👍🏻\nAnd Daya River is clear from this point. A beautiful monument, Dhauli Shanti Stupa lures you with its grandeur, serene atmosphere & beautiful views. A superb experience. This was always on our to do list while going to Bhubhaneswar. The stupa is at a slight distance away from Bhubaneswar and is reachable by car.😍🤟🏻\nIt is a beautiful structure with the Buddha in different poses and it is very peaceful here., if you have extra time and you have interest in these types of monuments. No doubt it is very peaceful area.🫠💗 I would suggest to go in the evening time and enjoy the sun set over there. It will be very hot in the summer afternoon as you have to go without shoes.. View from the top is very good....🫶🏻😇"

It is believed to be the site of the Kalinga War (261 BCE), where Emperor Ashoka witnessed massive bloodshed that changed his heart. Deeply moved, Ashoka renounced violence and embraced Buddhism, spreading messages of peace and compassion. The Japanese Buddhist Sangha later built the white Peace Pagoda (Shanti Stupa) here in 1972, symbolizing harmony and non-violence. Surrounded by ancient rock edicts of Ashoka and serene landscapes, Dhauli Shanti Stupa stands as a reminder of transformation, peace, and the universal message of brotherhood.\n\nExperience: Not much to explore, but it is a peaceful and pleasant place to visit. The four statues of Buddha each depict a story. I am not sure if private vehicles are allowed near the temple, as we traveled there on a small government bus.\n\nThe four Buddha statues at Dhauli Shanti Stupa (Peace Pagoda), Odisha represent the four significant stages of Lord Buddha’s life. Each statue is placed facing one direction of the stupa, symbolizing peace and compassion:\n\nBirth of Buddha (Lumbini) – Depicts the moment of Siddhartha Gautama’s birth.\n\nEnlightenment (Bodh Gaya) – Represents Buddha attaining enlightenment under the Bodhi tree.\n\nFirst Sermon (Sarnath) – Symbolizes the \"Dharmachakra Pravartan\" (Turning of the Wheel of Dharma) when he first taught the path.\n\nMahaparinirvana (Kushinagar) – Depicts Buddha’s final departure from the world, symbolizing eternal peace.\n\nThese statues together narrate Buddha’s journey and convey the message of non-violence, compassion, and universal peace."

The moment you step up to it, there’s a real sense of calm in the air - something about the white domed structure against the sky just puts your heart at ease.\n\nThe stupa itself is a beauty - gracefully built, with stunning carvings and elegant depictions of Lord Buddha in various postures. You don’t have to be deeply spiritual to feel the stillness of the place. It’s peaceful in a way that makes you want to just sit, take a breath, and let the world slow down a bit.\n\nFrom the top, you get a sweeping view of the Daya River flowing gently through the landscape - absolutely cracking at sunset, when the whole place is bathed in gold. Mind you, in the heat of the afternoon, it can get a bit much, especially since shoes have to come off - so aim for an evening visit if you can.\n\nIt’s free to enter, easy to reach by car, and honestly, it’s well worth the short drive out from the city. Whether you’re into history, architecture, or just fancy a peaceful moment with a view, Dhauli’s a spot that’ll stay with you."

A few improvements could make it even better: the seats could be upgraded for more comfort, and the AC, while effective, was a bit too cold and could be adjusted for a more ambient temperature. The projectors could use an upgrade for sharper visuals, and the screen clarity could also be improved. Introducing 3D shows would be a great addition too! Overall, a good place to learn and explore."

The planetarium is a testament to the dedication of its team, presenting an impressive array of videos about the sky and space. These shows, played in Odia, Hindi, and English, cater to a diverse audience with four different timings to choose from. The informative and engaging content provides a fascinating glimpse into the wonders of the universe, making it a fantastic educational outing for both adults and children. The ticket prices are quite reasonable, with adults paying 30 rupees and children under 15 paying just 20 rupees. However, the experience was somewhat marred by the fact that half of the screen was not functioning during the show. This technical issue detracted from the overall immersive experience and was a disappointment considering the otherwise high quality of the presentations. Despite this setback, the planetarium remains a valuable resource for learning and exploration. The affordability and the range of languages offered make it accessible to a broad audience, but it is hoped that the screen issue will be addressed soon to enhance the viewing experience further. Overall, it is a commendable effort that provides significant educational value to its visitors."

Built in 1058 CE by Kolavati Devi, the mother of Somavamsi king Udyotakesari, this temple marks an important transition in temple design, showcasing intricate craftsmanship and artistic excellence.\n\nCarved out of sandstone, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and features breathtaking sculptures of celestial dancers, musicians, and mythological figures. The introduction of iron beams in construction and the first use of surasundaris (heavenly maidens) on temple walls make it a significant milestone in temple architecture.\n\nSurrounded by smaller shrines, Brahmeswar Temple’s sanctum enshrines a powerful Shiva Lingam, drawing devotees and history lovers alike. The temple’s rekha deul (curvilinear spire) and the exquisite nagara-style carvings tell stories of devotion, art, and cultural grandeur. Even after nearly a thousand years, it remains a serene and spiritual landmark in Bhubaneswar, the City of Temples."

Built in Kalinga-style architecture, it features an elaborate rekha deula (tower) and intricate carvings of divine figures, musicians, and dancers. The temple marks the transition to more elaborate Odishan temple designs, influencing later structures like Lingaraj Temple. The presence of tantric symbols suggests tantric worship was practiced here. Surrounded by smaller shrines, it holds deep religious and historical significance. Situated about 10 km from the city center, it is easily accessible by taxis, auto-rickshaws, and local buses, making it a must-visit heritage site."

A complete waste of Money, time and last thing is very important to mention. It's the most unheigenic place I have ever visited. I was going to vomit with the smell it has near the lake. I talked with a few of the staff and they said it will be repaired in the future. Then why are they selling tickets for it. Why should not close the counter showing under maintenance. It's really bad to experience it. For now my suggestion, don't go there. You may try it after full repair is done."

Rs. 100 to me seems a little too high for a govt. managed park. Staff is cooperative, but what can they do if the park itself is very poorly managed.\n\nVery few attendance even on a Sunday afternoon. The area reeks with the stench of a nearby drain canal. Being centrally located, most of the earnings probably comes from wedding receptions and functions like that. I hope the area is developed to provide a good place for kids to play and have fun, especially in present times, where most of them are glued to the screens."

Inside the park, you’ll also find a Koraput Coffee outlet that offers coffee, millet cookies, and millet cake at reasonable prices.\n\nEntry Fees:\n\nCar Parking: ₹40\n\nAdults: ₹40\n\nChildren: ₹15"

Inspite of Monsoon the grounds were well trimmed.\nA lot of place and rides for kids to play and enjoy. The newly made Cactus House is a delight to watch. Have never seen so many varieties of Cactuses in one place.\n\nThe biggest flaw of the place is no Information inside. Again a similar flaw that I notice is Bhubaneswar tourist sites. We didn’t know where is what. There is no information about the biodiversity there. These are places from which visitors could learn a lot. It’s an amazingly built place with so much of knowledge. They should install information decks. Much required. Very cheap to enter and enjoy. If you traveling with kids, remember that Food is not allowed inside."

Spanning an impressive 487–500 acres, this verdant haven is managed by the Regional Plant Resource Centre and has been a city landmark since its founding in 1985  ￼.\n\nAs you wander through its diverse landscapes, you encounter several distinct zones. The highlight is the Cactus Garden, covering around 100 acres, featuring over 1,000 succulent and cactus varieties in a striking pyramid-style glasshouse  ￼. Nearby, themed flower gardens—scented flowers, hibiscus, and a vast rose garden—showcase hundreds of plant species, enhancing both your senses and Instagram feed  ￼.\n\nA serene 40-acre artificial lake lies at the heart of the garden. Visitors can enjoy & simply admire the migratory birdlife, especially during winter  ￼. A nearby birdwatching tower offers panoramic views of the lake and surrounding greenery  ￼.\n\nFamilies love the children’s play zone with swings, slides, and a musical fountain—sure to delight younger guests  ￼. Natural walking trails, built for morning and evening fitness routines, thread through woodland scenery, connecting visitors with the adjacent Chandaka forest  ￼.\n\nAmenities bolster the visitor experience: thoughtful walking trails (3 km), well-kept benches, restrooms, drinking water stations, and on-site stalls offering local handicrafts and light refreshments  ￼. The park’s popularity surges during the annual January flower show, a vibrant showcase of horticultural skills ."

There are two important structures here, one is the actual massive rock edict and the second is a rock carved elephant. The rock edict contains information about the laws that Ashoka implemented in Kalinga which he conquered post a bloody battle. The semi carved body of the elephant is supposed to represent Buddha.

The panel is below an elephant head carved out of that rock in the top side.  The people are using this as a picnic spot without realising the importance of the place. The translation of the edicts in vernacular Hindi and English is available in the place itself.\nThese are mainly talking about non violence and protection of women.  Fortunately the rock edicts are well preserved from vagaries of nature by a steel panel case.  To approach the hill top steps are there and the place is well maintained.  When we went it was raining and drizzling alternatively and hence the climate was too good to enjoy the beauty of this 2nd century AD masterpiece in tact."

              "reviewText": "Indian art consists of a variety of art forms, including painting, sculpture, pottery, and textile arts such as woven silk. Geographically, it spans the entire Indian subcontinent, including what is now India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bhutan and eastern Afghanistan. A strong sense of design is characteristic of Indian art and can be observed in its modern and traditional forms.\nThe origin of Indian art can be traced to pre-historic settlements in the 3rd millennium BC. On its way to modern times, Indian art has had cultural influences, as well as religious influences such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism and Islam. In spite of this complex mixture of religious traditions, generally, the prevailing artistic style at any time and place has been shared by the major religious groups.\nIn historic art, sculpture in stone and metal, mainly religious, has survived the Indian climate better than other media and provides most of the best remains. Many of the most important ancient finds that are not in carved stone come from the surrounding, drier regions rather than India itself. Indian funeral and philosophic traditions exclude grave goods, which is the main source of ancient art in other cultures.\nIndian artist styles historically followed Indian religions out of the subcontinent, having an especially large influence in Tibet, South East Asia and China. Indian art has itself received influences at times, especially from Central Asia and Iran, and Europe."

It was very crowded that day, but we were still able to get a good darshan of  bagwan.The idols of the deities are so captivating and beautiful. Lord Jagannath looked so divine that day, I didn’t feel like leaving. The temple has idols of Lord Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra, and also Radha-Krishna, all of which are extremely beautiful, enchanting, and charming.There is such a positive vibe there. After entering the temple, you feel a deep sense of peace. Seeing the deities brings tears to your eyes—nothing compares to it. And that day, they were also distributing prasad. The prasad is served there.What I loved the most inside the temple was the idols of the deities—their decorations, their attire, and the positive vibes—they were truly wonderful. The temple is shaped like a lotus flower. Prasad is available outside the temple and can also be purchased inside. Overall, it was a very beautiful experience. A must-visit place.\""

              "reviewText": "She is the goddess chamunda. She is the goddess of guhya kali krama. She herself is guhyeswari(गुह्येश्वरी). The main difference between kali and maa chamunda is \"she is that energy which comes from the heart of kali.\" Thats the main reason she termed as guhya(गुह्या). She is the White light that emerges from Maa Kalikaa . Thats why she also known as Swet Kali (श्वेतकाली) and related to full moon (पूर्णिमा). She is in every Dus mahavidyas, infact she is the heart of mahavidyas. She is the divine goddess of knowledge and related to panchami tithi. Like Nrusingha(नरसिंह) she is also termed as Nara-Devi(नरदेवी), the goddess is in human form and related to navami tithi. When she drank the blood of Rakt beej (रक्त बीज) demon, then the RBC(Red Blood Cell) in her body went down and only WBC(White Blood Cell) is left in her body thats the main reason she is very lean and thin, even her bones in her body can be seen easily. She is the goddess of war thats why she related to Chaturdashi tithi also. After drinking the blood of rakt beej then the wife of rakt beej cursed her that the charm in her face will  fade. Thats the main reason the face of maa chamunda looks very fiery. Rakt beej also  a great devotee of maa so maa chamunda held the rakt beej in scorpion form in the centre of her heart. Thats why in some Idol of maa chamunda you can clearly see a scorpio in the centre of her chest. She removes any vikara related to blood or planet mars as well as she removes any ill effects of saturn. She is a very motherly goddess. She is directly related to maa mahalaxmi infact maa lakshmi is one of her guardian deity of maa chamunda. The goddess of bhutas and dakinis is worshipped in this temple. She is daughter of odisha (कलिङ्गा तनया ). Thats why odisha is termed as chamunda pitha in shakt dharma. She sits upon mahapreta who is none other than our ancestors. So she is the goddess of our ancestors. By worshipping her any ancestral issue will be solved in no time. She is the goddess where both hanuman ji and bhairav ji serves her. Infact these are some details which i knew from my past experiences. You guys can visit this temple on specially tuesday and saturday as very sweet drink(prasad) is served on those days . Jai maa chamunda"

              "reviewText": "Vaitala Deula temple is dedicated to Goddess Chamundi & is located in the Old Town of Bhubaneswar. It is also known as Tini-mundia deula due to the three spires on top of it, which is a very distinct feature of the temple. The three spires are believed to represent the three powers of the Goddess Mother, Chamunda - Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi and Mahakali. The presiding deity Chamunda sits on a corpse flanked by a jackal and an owl and is decorated with a garland of skulls. She holds a snake, bow, shield, sword, trident, thunderbolt and an arrow, and is piercing the neck of the demon.  The temple is very easy to be missed. It's not as well known as the Lingaraj Temple or Parashurameshwara Temple or Mukteswara Temple. Also, almost adjoining the temple are residential houses. Perhaps, Archaeological Survey of India should strictly enforce it's laws & ensure ancient monuments are protected, & an important aspect to that is to secure the lands in the immediate vicinity of a monument & protecting it from encroachment. Along with other great temples in the Old Town, this temple also has to be promoted."

He fought one of the most vicious and bloody wars with King of Kalinga and adopted the path of Dharma and Peace after seeing the death of thousands of soldiers here.\nThe river Daya flows close to this hill.\nThe top of the hill provides a unique and picturesque view of the Bhubaneswar city. There is ample parking area. They charge an entry fee of Rs.40 from 4 wheeler vehicles, not sure of 2 wheeler vehicles.\nThere are a lot of small shops near the hill that sell souvenirs and food items.\nThe light and music show at Dhauli (see my photo uploads) is by far the best that I have seen. The show gives a glimpse of the lives of the kings of the Mourya empire and specifically focuses on the Kalinga war that transformed King Ashoka from a warrior to a peace loving king\nA must visit place in Bhubaneswar."

The peace pagoda (Shanti Stupa) stands majestically against the sky, and the white dome structure with intricate carvings makes it a perfect backdrop for photos.\n\nSurrounded by lush greenery and calm vibes, it’s a great place to reflect, relax, and soak in both history and beauty. Whether you're into photography, heritage, or just looking for a quiet escape, Dhauli Hills is well worth the visit."

The east-facing temple is built in the panchayatana layout, with a central main temple accompanied by four smaller subsidiary shrines. The temples are set within a pretty and well manicured garden that is maintained by the ASI. North lintel frieze of Jagamohana window depicting Krishna playing his flute amidst enchanted followers and listening cattle\nThe temple is thought to have been constructed around the middle of the 13th century A.D. This potentially suggests it could have been instigated by the Ganga dynasty king Narasingha Deva I (also known as Parama Mahesvara) who reigned over the kingdom of Kalinga (ancient Odisha) between circa 1238 and 1264 A.D. This is the same ruler who is attributed as the builder of the Sun Temple at Konark. The temple’s name is derived from the Goddess Chitrakarini, a Sanskrit term that roughly translates to “Paintress”. She is a form of the Goddess Saraswati, who is regarded as the prime goddess of knowledge and creative expression."

In the name of editing, face is being completely whitened; who does not have a problem with this, then it's okay but who wants authenticity of the face being maintained, then we might have a problem. Client's requirements are not fulfilled, instead we are being told that we are amature and don't know about photography. Their is no doubt in the photography skill but if one remains a little bit open towards understanding client's needs then the overall experience would have been good.\nAll in all the experience is not worth the money( Rs 250/ softcopy taken)"

If the platform is more height then it is good for passenger to get down from train or to climb up on the train.. Sometimes when the express comes with much much speed then dusts and leaf of the tree and some other polythin, food packets etc comes with the train which is very much bad for travellers who wait for train on the platform, so please increase its height. It is also a junction and a lots of train cross through this station so services should be better.."

The quality of the photos was far below expectations — poorly framed, poorly edited, and lacking creativity. It's hard to believe the glowing reviews here are genuine; they come across as fake or paid promotions. I suggest potential clients ask for recent, unedited work samples before booking. Transparency and real feedback matter.! Given single star as I am unable to give 0 stars! He just loots money stating it's affordable one compared to competitors! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !"

Luckily I found these guys and trust me they are the best. Extremely polite, always before time and highly accommodating. I am bad at posing so I explained them how I want my pics and videos more candid, people having fun and they have captured all the fun moments amazingly well. From photos to videos to my photo album everything is perfect. My entire family now love their work.

RS Wedding Bells’s talented photographer and cinematographer, deserve an overflowing measure of gratitude and applause.\n\nFrom the first click to the final frame, RS Wedding Bells skillfully navigated the delicate balance between being observers and becoming a part of our celebration.

Their cinematography brought our day to life, capturing the movement, the voices, and the laughter that paint the complete picture of our wedding.

Their dedication and professionalism shone through, making us feel at ease even during the most hectic moments.

They evoke not just the scenes but the emotions, taking us back to that day in all its glory. RS Wedding Bells' work has given us the gift of reliving our wedding, not just as a mental recollection, but as a visual and auditory masterpiece that touches the heart.\n\nSo, to RS Wedding Bells, we extend our deepest gratitude. Thank you for your artistry, your dedication, and your patience. Thank you for capturing the essence of our love and weaving a story through images and film that we'll share with generations to come.
