Go here for more special items rather than cheap souvenirs that you're gonna buy 15 or 20 pieces of.. as items here are quite pricey. Warehouse 2 is where it's at as warehouse 1 has much fewer stores and only have 1 cafe. Is there a lot of people? Yea. That's the crowd size you expect for this type of place. Just learn to accept it and you'll have a good time. Would definitely visit again if I get the chance.",

            "text": "Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse\nReview on 15/4/2025\n\nA brisk walk led me to the Yokohama Red Brick Warehouse, an iconic landmark at close proximity to Yokohama's waterfront. Before reaching the two historic buildings, I passed through large, open squares for hosting events. On this visit, the Flower Gardens 2025 were in full bloom, transforming the open space into a kaleidoscope of colours.\n\nOriginally constructed as customs warehouses in the early 20th century, the two red-brick buildings have since been restored and repurposed into a lively hub for shopping, dining, and cultural events. Since their reopening in 2002, they have breathed fresh energy into Yokohama's waterfront.\n\nThough Japan is home to several Red Brick Warehouse complexes, none belongs to a formal chain. Each stands as a unique landmark, preserving its own local history while serving the community in distinct ways.\n\nWhile Building No. 1 is primarily dedicated to hosting art exhibitions, concerts, and performances, my time was spent exploring Building No. 2, a treasure trove of boutique stores. These shops showcase everything from local crafts, artisanal goods, and souvenirs, to intricate handmade jewellery, exquisite glassware, and carefully crafted homeware.\n\nOne feature that stood out during my visit was the impeccable presentation of Japanese products. The packaging of goods was not only visually stunning but also reflected exceptional craftsmanship and attention to detail.\n\nHowever, I was taken aback to find Chinese mooncakes for sale at the cake store. These pastries with sweet fillings hold profound Chinese cultural significance, traditionally reserved for celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month. I could not help but wonder - was this a misunderstanding or a sign of cultural misappropriation? While the recipe may be used year-round, the term \"mooncake\" carries tradition and meaning that extends beyond mere confectionery.\n\nToward the rear of Building No. 2 lies a variety of cafés and restaurants, offering a delightful selection of cakes, pastries, and other culinary delights. From Japanese-inspired treats to Western-style desserts, there is something for every palate. The fusion of flavours creates an enticing blend of East meets West.\n\nThe presence of artisan bread and freshly brewed coffee store within the Red Brick Warehouse is a testament to their swift and undeniable integration into the fabric of everyday Japanese life.",

Yokohama Chinatown is the biggest Chinatown in Japan, and it's absolutely packed with amazing food, bright lanterns, and beautiful gates at every corner. Super easy to get to from Tokyo too-just around 40–50 minutes by train.\n\nThere's so much to explore here! The streets are filled with Chinese restaurants, snack stalls, dim sum shops, and souvenir stores. I recommend trying the pork buns, sesame balls, and soup dumplings-there are lines at some places, but they move fast and it's totally worth it.\n\nBesides food, the area is just fun to walk around. It's very photogenic, especially at night when the lights come on. There's also a beautiful temple (Kanteibyo) right in the middle of it all that adds to the atmosphere.\n\nI went during the afternoon and stayed until evening-perfect timing to enjoy the shops and see everything light up. It can get busy, especially on weekends, but that's part of the energy.",

Our kids felt sorry to see so many animals in such poor condition and obvious zoochosis, depression, and distress.\n\nAs commenters have said years ago, it'd be better to charge a few and invest to improve conditions or shut the zoo down.

I personally didn't.\n\nThey do animals talks (not in English of course, someone in my group helped translate) it's a good event to see since the animals come closer since the keepers feed them during the talk.\n\nThe cafe had some nice ice cream treats and there are vending machines in a couple areas for cold treats during the summer (I assume they switch it out for warm things maybe during the cold season).\n\nTwo indoor areas for resting, the cafe and another building near the petting zoo. Both air conditioned.\n\nGift shop had a good variety and they sold some food there as well.",

It's creative, interactive, and surprisingly satisfying!\n\nThe museum also has cool exhibits on the history of instant noodles and some quirky photo spots.

We got our tickets at the counter about 2 hours before closing (we were at the Anpanman Museum first). 🥺\n\nIt was crowded with students and tourists, so that's something to expect. The place itself is quite educational with lots of photo spots, but the highlight for me was making and customizing my own cup noodle cup 🍜✨ It costs an extra 500 yen but was worth every yen-I enjoyed this the most. 👏🏻\n\nThey also have tons of noodle-themed souvenirs (a little pricey as expected), and I heard there's a restaurant serving noodles from around the world. Unfortunately, we didn't get to try it since we ran out of time and already had a late lunch.\n\nOverall, really fun and memorable! Great for kids and adults alike, and I'd definitely recommend. Planning to bring my family next April when in Tokyo again-this time I'll book in advance and make sure to try the restaurant too 😙",

I like how the route is properly structured with clear signs and barricades so it's a straightforward 1-way walk thru from the Lobby (first floor) through to the top deck, and leading thru to the exit on Deck B1.\n\nLobby - Children's Room - Dining Hall - Reading Room - Social Hall - Exhibition Room: Voyage to Seattle - Smoking Room - First Class Cabin (am impressed by how they have connecting rooms even in the cabins and the idea of folding blankets into shapes, is this the earliest form of towel art?) - Deluxe Cabin (for royalty, wowed by the bathtub within the cabin) - Wheelhouse and Captain's Office (the control room, including the Telegraph office. Captain's Office and bedroom is one, and just below the Wheelhouse and that trumpet looking thing that's a voice tube that allows whoever is on duty upstairs to keep in touch with the Captain.) - Engine Room - Galley (kitchen) - Third Class cabin (better than I imagined) - Exhibition (journey of Hikawa Maru).\n\nEasy walk and enjoyable visit, I appreciate that all captions/descriptions came in English, very tourist friendly, though a number of flights to maneuver towards the top deck and later to the engine room. I also like that it isn't crowded which gives me ample time to take all the videos and photos I want and read every caption at my own pace without feeling rushed.\n\nToilets on 3rd deck are really small and tight, if you can wait, best to go to the one at the Lobby (which you will get to only towards the end as you make the way down towards the Exit). Took me just over an hour from boarding to alighting.",

A bold \"Yokohama World Porters\" sign above the main entrance welcomes visitors.\n\nI was fascinated by the word \"Porters\"; I believe it is likely inspired by how Yokohama has long been a gateway or harbour hub for global trade and cultural exchange\n\nThis vibrant mall offers a mix of shopping, dining, and entertainment, but with limited time, we could not explore every floor.\n\nThe first floor is home to the renowned World Food Hall (see separate review), showcasing a diverse range of international cuisines. Beyond food, this level also features shops selling Hawaiian-themed fashion, souvenirs, beachwear, jewelry, and home décor.\n\nMeanwhile, the second and third floors are a true shopper's paradise, packed with fashion, interior design, and lifestyle goods at competitive prices. My traveling companions from Australia and Malaysia purchased brand name shoes here at significantly cheaper compared to back home, making it a great spot for bargain hunters.",

I was convinced to wait a little bit before reviewing this temple because of my negative first impressions. This is the single most overrated place in Japan for a fan of culture or Buddhism. While I was here I saw a Basketball game and did not enjoy the constant sounds of Techno and hard rock music playing throughout the temple grounds (I am not kidding.) At the main entrance to the Temple two people were playing an accordion. There was an American style drum solo that blocked off the main building. Other parts were under construction. Please only go here if you have been to many other Temples already. If you choose this as your first temple you will get the wrong impression. Try and check ahead to see if they will be playing loud music or basketball before visiting. Enjoy the Techno music. (please see Edit this is not a regular occurance)\n\nEdit: It has come to my attention that there was a local event at the time I visited. Most major buildings are indeed open most of the year.\nSo check ahead and you may have a great time. It just was not my cup of tea on that date.",

A lot of thoughts have been put into the details.\n\nThe only downside is the inconvenience of buying the entrance tickets at the convenience store at level 1 (Note that museum is at level 2) by foreigners.\n\nThe ticket needs to be purchased from a machine that looks like a copier within the convenience store. We struggled for a while and got help from the local to buy the tickets as most of the on-screen instructions were in Japanese even if English was selected. Even the two kindhearted guy and lady who help us were struggling. Hope the museum can look at selling the ticket at the entrance. We really appreciate their help , or we would have given up. You need to fill up a contact number when buying the ticket. Just fill out the convenience store number listed on the instruction sheet on the machine. Once the forms are completed, such as time slot for the visit, an order sheet will be printed, then you have to make payment at the cashier.\n\nAt the museum, we can see a few families and local couples, so we are most likely the only foreigners there.\n\nIf you plan the visit, I hope the above will help.
