Very serene and condensed, and also extremely romantic. There is the main lake, but also several bridges, a couple of small hills, winding walking path, a central shrine, and finally, in the small lake also fish and water turtles\nI suggest you give yourself at least a couple of hours here\nAlso, getting here, I highly recommend walking the path on the riverbank.\nPlease see photos\nOh, of course, the wonderful art museum is right close by and the ticket can include both beautiful and highly spiritually satisfying attractions.

The views from above was breathtaking with a clear sightline view of the atomic bombed structure. Last entry into the castle was 530pm on the day we visited. Don't skip this attraction when you visit.",

Nestled in the middle of the city, surrounded by a wide moat and shaded pathways, it offered a tranquil escape from the busy streets. We visited in the afternoon, and the soft sunlight filtering through the trees gave the place a calm and nostalgic atmosphere.\n\nThe current castle is a reconstruction, as the original was destroyed during the atomic bombing in 1945. But it's been beautifully rebuilt, and the exterior maintains that iconic traditional Japanese style. Inside, the castle has been turned into a museum, with several floors of exhibitions on samurai culture, castle history, and Hiroshima's development over the centuries. It was educational without being overwhelming. We especially enjoyed trying on samurai armor at one of the activity corners.\n\nOnce you reach the top floor, you're rewarded with a panoramic view of the city. It's not the tallest viewpoint in Hiroshima, but the sight of the surrounding grounds, the moat, and the distant mountains made the climb worthwhile.\n\nDefinitely recommend spending an hour or two here. It's a gentle, enriching experience for both history lovers and families.",

Representing the beautiful rich colors of the autumn leaves, you should also eat an autumn-leaf-shaped sweet steamed bun known as “Momiji Manju”. It’s a famous snack on Miyajima Island, which you can also take home as an omiyage snack souvenir, but best freshly cooked while you’re there.",

The interior space is fully cladded in timber with a gentle slope towards the perimeter of the building envelope. A spiral slope takes you from the top floor to the 1st while you engage with the artwork on every floor to solve a quiz for a little token prize at the end. For those not interested in the quiz, there's a slide that also takes you down to 1st level in a fraction of the time. You can also participate in folding cranes and contribute to the collection piling up on the facade if the building. Very meaningful and worth your time if you have it.",
