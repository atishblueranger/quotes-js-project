You can buy koi or pigeon food for 200 yen for small bag or 500 yen one big bag. The mini Mt Fuji is kind of not that impressive but the garden is still nice. There are vending machines and a few public restrooms. We spent about 80 minutes here feeding the koi and pigeons, so expect to spend between 30 minutes to maybe 2 hours here if you enjoy just sitting down and taking in the surroundings. Beware of mosquitoes in the summer because there is standing water.",

Took 45 mins, maybe to tour thro the whole temple area, and see the view of the farm fields next to the temple grounds. Worth it. Just make sure to have a number to call a taxi when your done.",

The temple and cave are nice and the place is a must visit if you know Miyamoto Musashi. It was pretty empty.

The other staff at the hotel I talked with were polite with their speaking.\n\nAlso, the room is advertised to be newly renovated one month ago, and I paid one-third of the extra price to get a renovated room instead of a non-renovated room, I found that the cushions inside the room have a large portion of visible stains, and the carpet is very dirty. The bed seems to be clean.",
