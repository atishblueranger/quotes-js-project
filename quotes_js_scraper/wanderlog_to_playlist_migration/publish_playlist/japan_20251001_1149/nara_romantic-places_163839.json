Established in 768 A.D., it offers plenty of photo opportunities both inside and outside the pay area. The shrine's surroundings also provide numerous great spots for photography. The transfer of the national capital to Nagaoka-kyo led to the development of Naramachi as a temple town, with Kasuga Taisha becoming a prominent attraction.",

You'll find yourself surrounded by expansive gardens and friendly deer roaming freely, which is the main highlight of the visit.\nInteracting with the Deer\nThe best part is feeding the deer. Be sure to buy their special crackers from the vendors (around 200 yen). A heads-up: the deer can be quite bold when they see food! They might try to get a cracker straight from your hand or even your bag, so be prepared and enjoy the fun.\nPractical Tips for Your Visit\n* Getting Around: While walking is a great way to explore the park, you can also use the local buses to save time and get to the various temples and attractions scattered around the area.\n* Nearby Attractions: The park is conveniently located near several historical temples, which are a must-see.\n* Shopping: Don't miss the market near the train station for local shops and snacks.\n* Best Time to Visit: I recommend avoiding the summer months, as the heat can be intense. Other seasons are perfect for walking and enjoying the beautiful scenery.\nOverall, Nara Park offers a unique blend of nature, culture, and animal interaction. It's definitely worth a visit!",

The site is known for its two pagodas, each representing different periods of Japanese history. The East Pagoda, built in 1285, is admired for its asymmetrical design and has been likened to 'frozen music' by an early Western specialist in Japanese art.",

It’s not a must-see, but it’s great for those with an interest in Buddhism who plan to spend more than one day in Nara. It’s usually paired with a visit to nearby Toshodai-ji Temple (see following).",

Originally constructed in 680 CE during the Asuka period by Emperor Tenmu, the temple was built to pray for the recovery of his wife, Empress Jitō. Dedicated to Yakushi Nyorai, the Buddha of Medicine and Healing, the temple symbolizes hope and spiritual healing.\n\nYakushiji is renowned for its symmetrical layout and stunning architecture, epitomizing the classical style of early Japanese Buddhism. The temple complex includes several iconic structures, most notably the East Pagoda (東塔, Tōtō), a three-story pagoda dating back to the 8th century. This is the only original structure that survived multiple fires and is celebrated for its elegant design and intricate details. The West Pagoda (西塔, Saitō) and the Kondō (金堂, Main Hall) have been meticulously reconstructed to preserve their historical and spiritual significance.\n\nInside the Kondō, visitors can find an extraordinary bronze triad statue of Yakushi Nyorai flanked by two Bodhisattvas, exemplifying artistic mastery from the Hakuho period. These statues are considered national treasures and reflect the deep devotion to Buddhist teachings.\n\nIn addition to its architectural and artistic treasures, Yakushiji Temple serves as an active center for Buddhist worship and meditation. The temple's tranquil atmosphere and rich history make it a UNESCO World Heritage Site and a must-visit destination for those seeking to explore Japan's cultural and spiritual heritage.",

Many great and famous guests, including Japanese royals, have stayed here, and the corridors are lined with photos showcasing its distinguished visitors.\n\nAs expected from an old hotel, the interior has a vintage feel, and while the rooms show their age, they are well-equipped with everything you need. Service is standard-nothing exceptional, but sufficient.\n\nThe location is convenient, less than a 20-minute walk to Nara Station. The walk itself is enjoyable, with plenty of interesting shops, cafés, and restaurants along the way. A great stay for those who appreciate history and charm!",

Sunsets are nothing less than stunning here. They carried our luggage all over the place, and they had a shuttle bus to and from the station. It was truly an amazing experience. If you book right, you can pay less than a standard APA room. Next time I want to stay a whole week! Bravo to this monument and the crew that operates it 👏",
