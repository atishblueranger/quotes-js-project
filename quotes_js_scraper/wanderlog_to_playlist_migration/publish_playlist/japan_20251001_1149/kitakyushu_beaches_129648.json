You can take in the whole of the Kanmon strait, looking across to Kyushu.  You also get great views towards Shimonoseki city and Korea (though obviously Korea isn't visible).\n\nThere is also what I assume to be an old artillery fort with old bunkers and gun emplacements that you can explore.

            "text": "Hiking Mt. Komonji (小文字山) – A Rewarding Urban Escape in Kitakyushu\n\nLast week, I hiked Mt. Komonji (小文字山) in Kitakyushu, and it was an invigorating experience! Though the trail is short, it presents a steep climb that challenges even seasoned hikers. The effort is well worth it, as the summit offers breathtaking panoramic views of Kitakyushu city, especially enchanting during twilight. ￼\n\nTrail Insights:\n•\tThe ascent is steep and can be slippery in parts; sturdy hiking shoes are recommended.\n•\tSafety ropes and chains are available on the trail to assist with the climb.\n•\tThe hike typically takes about an hour to reach the summit.\n\nTips:\n•\tBring sufficient water and perhaps a light snack to enjoy at the top.\n•\tIf you plan to descend after sunset, carry a flashlight or headlamp, as the trail can be quite dark. ￼\n\nBy Car:\nMany visitors choose to drive to the trailhead. There is a parking area available near the starting point of the hike, providing a convenient option for those traveling by private vehicle.\n\nOn Foot:\nFor those preferring to walk, the trailhead is within walking distance from JR Kokura Station. The hike from the station to the base of Mt. Komonji offers a pleasant stroll through the city, allowing hikers to experience the local atmosphere before beginning the ascent.\n\nMt. Komonji may not be as renowned as nearby Mt. Sarakura, but it offers a serene and less crowded alternative with equally stunning views. It's a perfect spot for those seeking a quick yet fulfilling hike within the city.",
