I wouldn't recommend making a special visit just for the store, but it's worth a look if you're a Sony enthusiast. On the floor above there was a very nice exhibition of photos from Mongolia.

Entry is free, but you need to make a reservation online ahead of time for a specific time slot. Very much worth the effort, especially the Hitsujibugaku show in my opinion.\n\nThe building itself is very open and well thought-out too; a great use of space, angles, and light that feels welcoming yet with its own character in every corner.\n\nA welcome departure from the shopping-focused vibes in most of Ginza.",

            "text": "Really cool and interesting new building by Sony. The Sony restaurant in the basement is awesome. The food was delicious and they let you keep the menu as a souvenir. Aside from that the attractions are very cool. Though you need to book ahead of time as demand is high and they are changed after some time. When I went there was a very cool experience with haptics and water and I got to see Sony's new EV car on the roof of the building. I definitely recommend checking this place out in Tokyo.",

It's free and you can register on the website.\n\nWhile it's under construction you cannot access every floor easily. Sometimes you can only take the stairs for one floor then you're forced to take the elevator. The worst thing is there is only one tiny tiny elevator. The best way to avoid waiting forever and being disappointed by a full elevator is to take the elevator from b2f which is actually located in ginza station. Do not enter via the street level.",
