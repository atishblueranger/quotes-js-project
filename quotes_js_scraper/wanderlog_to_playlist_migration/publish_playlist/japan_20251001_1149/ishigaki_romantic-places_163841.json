Our room was wonderful, and the service was fantastic. This spot is perfect for couples, friends, or family trips. The price is also very reasonable, especially if you book in advance. While it's not super close to the airport, they offer a free pick-up service, which is a huge plus. It can get a bit crowded during peak season, so consider visiting during the off-season for a more relaxed vibe. Overall, wholeheartedly recommend this place to anyone!",

But if you're traveling with a toddler or baby in tow, welcome to paradise.\n\nDo keep in mind, however, that the resort experience is designed almost entirely in Japanese. Staff were kind and tried their best, but their English was limited - and there was no English version of the hotel map or facility guides. We found ourselves frequently using a translation app or heading to the concierge to ask for help, which added a bit of extra time to everything.\n\nThat said, the staff's warmth, the quality of the food, and the family-friendly facilities made up for it. We'd happily come back - especially with our little one.",

Only two places to park your car. So better be hurry.\nIf you are trying to avoid crowd, then this the perfect place. But there are no bathing facilities. Actually no other facilities. But you can enjoy a private time. Enjoy ultra blue ocean and pure white sandy beach.",

Water is so clear that you can see fish without swimming!\nIt was so many corals and hard to swim through. It was really sad to see families and kids were standing on the corals I really hope people don't destroy corals to preserve beautiful beach 😢\nGo early as it gets busy. We went on Monday around 10:00 in July, but it was already busy. Only few spots for free parking. Rest is 500 yen. Shower is ¥300, so you might want to bring water to rinse yourself.",

Great spot for snorkeling, for beaching not so special tho.",
