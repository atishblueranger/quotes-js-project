Fringed by forest, the 334-metre-tall (1,096ft) mountain can be reached by car, bus, ropeway or on foot via a steep one-hour hike in Japan’s warmer months (the walking trails are open May to October). The vista from the free observation deck is jaw-dropping, especially at night, with the lights below twinkling on the narrow stretch of city between Hakodate harbour to the west and the Tsugaru Strait to the east.",

It was also easy to adjust the temperature, and open the window to gaze at the night sky while bathing.\n\nApparently it is possible to stay here without including the meals. Doing that, I think, would be a mistake. The food here is simply outstanding! The ingredients are fresh and delicious, while the menu offers a plentiful variety of kaiseki dishes.\n\nThe only drawback to this hotel is the location. It is a bit difficult to get to from Hakodate station. Apparently they offer a shuttle service from the nearby airport, though I did not take advantage of this service.

In short, if you are looking for a luxurious ryokan experience and can afford to stay, or you get a deal like I did, it is so worth staying here for a night or two.\n\nFrom the second you walk into the lobby, you know you are in for a special experience. It is so fancy and luxurious. You are greeted with local desserts and hot tea. The tea room/cafe is spacious, comfortable and has free coffee and tea. There is a library area with books you could read or just where you can bring your own book to read. There's a billiards table as well. The long, spacious bar has excellent drinks, including a seasonal menu when I was there, and is a great place to relax at night. All of this overlooks a beautiful zen garden, and the water features in the lobby give the appearance that all of these spaces are floating.\n\nThe room is equally impressive as well. My wife and I stayed in the Suite Type A, and I couldn't believe how nice it was. The bathroom upstairs has two sinks, as well as the beautiful private onsen that you can access at any time. This was really convenient, and really lovely to relax in. Down the stairs brings you to the two beds, a tatami mat room, the toilet and a living room area. The mini-fridge is stocked with complementary drinks and snacks, and there's a coffee machine and tea pot to make drinks in your room if you would like. The two types of lounge wear (yukata and the \"monk's clothes\") were really comfortable. It is a great place to rest, unwind and relax. On the top floor, you can access the Sky Salon, which overlooks the town and has comfortable seats and massage chairs for you to relax in. You can also get complimentary drinks, snacks and ice cream up here. This is also where you can access the open-air onsen, the communal indoor onsens, and the sauna. My wife and I have tattoos so we were not allowed to use these facilities, but I did not mind since we had the one in our suite to use as well. But it is important to note if that is a dealbreaker for you.\n\nThe service is also top notch, especially when it comes to the dining here. Definitely make sure to eat at this ryokan, it is an incredible 6-course dinner with high-quality ingredients, thoughtful dishes and absolutely delicious food. The breakfast is just as elegant and high quality. And the private dining rooms you get to eat in are absolutely gorgeous. These meals were one of the main highlights of our stay here. The service at Bourou Noguchi, both at dinner and outside of the meals, were top notch. The staff is so wonderful and friendly, very helpful and willing to help with whatever you may need. There's also a complementary taxi service. They picked us up from the airport, and drove us to the train station in the morning.\n\nIn short, definitely make this hotel a priority if you are coming to Hakodate. You will not regret it",

Firstly, we needed to take a queue number from the machine, then wait for 2 minutes, then be seated.\n\nWe ordered both signatures set; Russian set and Meiji western food set.\n\nRussian set was delicious. The server taught us to pour the crab cream croquettes into the borscht soup. Wow, so delicious.  beef stroganoff was done perfectly. Piroshki with filling was surprisingly delicious. Award cake just mediocre. 5 stars\n\nMeiji western set, we opted for British style curry with beef. There were two kinds of beef inside this set; curry beef and stew beef. Both were also delicious, soft, and juicy. Fried shrimp just mediocre, nothing special. Today potage was delicious. Taste wise, this set just 3 stars. But, this set was valued for money as the portion was generous. 3 stars",

As a tourist and first timer in Hakodate, I naturally ordered its\nRussian Food Set comprising a Russian plate of beef stroganoff & croquette, some Borsht soup, a fried Pirozhki bread bun with \"curry\" filling, a soft bread, some Russian salad, and a Gotoken Quard cake - by the way, the restaurant also specialises in many versions of curry, from Japanese to Nepalese to the English version. And his was its Russian Food Set? It was certainly worth it - especially its stroganoff and croquette, and its Borsht soup. I also ordered to go with my Russian Food Set, a Bakumatsu dark beer that was very good. Service here was \"okay\" and the dining ambience was good enough. By the way, the building in which the restaurant is located also houses a bakery section with a sort of museum section therein.",
