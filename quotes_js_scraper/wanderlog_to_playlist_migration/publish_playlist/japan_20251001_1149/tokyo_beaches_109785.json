The familiar melody echoed in my thoughts, and I couldn't help but remember the lyrics:\n\"Every time you go away, you take a piece of me with you.\"\nIt felt so fitting. I thought of the days when my ex-girlfriend and I used to walk hand in hand along Sentosa Beach in Singapore, the sound of the waves mixing with our laughter, our hearts in sync as we strolled along the shore. We had even talked about getting married soon, dreaming of a future together. It felt like nothing could tear us apart.\nBut now, as I walked alone in Odaiba, the song in my mind became a haunting reminder of what we lost. Every time you go away, those words echoed louder, a painful reminder that with her departure, she took a piece of me. Our dreams, our love, the future we had planned... all of it vanished, leaving behind only the ache of what could have been.\nTonight, as I walked through Odaiba, the song reminded me of the heartbreak, of the love that once was, and of the plans that would never come true. Yet, no matter how far we've drifted apart, those memories, and that piece of me she took with her, will forever be imprinted on my heart.",

While the beach itself is serene and uncrowded, there are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby, making it easy to grab a delicious meal or a refreshing drink after a day by the sea. Whether you're planning a romantic getaway, a solo retreat, or a fun day out with friends and family, this beach has something for everyone.\n\nFor those who love photography or simply enjoy breathtaking views, the scenery here is spectacular-especially during sunrise and sunset, when the sky paints the ocean in stunning shades of orange and pink. If you're looking for a stress-free, nature-filled beach experience without traveling too far from Tokyo, this hidden gem is an absolute must-visit!",

You are met by a sign explaining the rules at the beach and considering that I have large tattoos over my body, I decided that I won't try my luck, so I just dipped my toes. The water was very warm, the sand is fine - like silk. At this time the beach was relatively quiet, considering that it's the beginning of the school year and it's kind of late. I managed to capture the sun going down - beautiful and fulfilling picture.\nThere are some bars and other venues which I did not visit, because it was after or near their closing time.\nThe beach was generally clean, but still there was some trash left here and there (also some thrown by the sea), hence the 4 stars.\nStill a great place to visit!",

The atmosphere was electric, and I found myself completely captivated by the colors and sounds.\n\nThe beach offers plenty of space for viewing, and I appreciated that it wasn't overly crowded, possibly because the fireworks show is a monthly event. Just bring your own mat for a comfortable spot on the sand, and you're all set.\n\nOverall, the Atami Sea Fireworks was a fantastic experience that I would highly recommend to anyone looking for a magical evening by the sea!",

            "text": "Not worth going all the way to this beach when visiting Kamakura. The place has amazing temples, pretty distant from each other, and a lively shopping street. Going down the beach is time consuming and not worth it. The beach is not particularly nice, not really used for bathing and there are no facilities. I wish we had skipped it and spent more time sightseeing temples.",
