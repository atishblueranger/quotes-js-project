The inner keep of Osaka Castle is situated on a plot of land roughly one square kilometre. It is built on two raised platforms of landfill supported by sheer walls of cut rock, using a technique called burdock piling, each overlooking a moat. The keep is five stories on the outside and eight stories on the inside and built atop a tall stone foundation to protect its occupants from attackers. The castle has two moats (an inner and an outer one). The castle grounds, which cover approximately 61,000 square metres (15 acres). Popular place, need to go early. Keep an eye on your valuables. Very crowded level terrain outside, lots of walking though. Inside castle lots of stair climbing. Wear comfy shoes, take water, wear hat, sunscreen. Beautiful place. Lots to see. Fee charged for entry.",

Around the castle are a lot of spray foggy areas.\nInside the castle, there is AC .\nI highly recommend buying the ticket in advance through the website of the castle.\nThat will save you a lot of time. I think I have saved 40 minutes of waiting.\nThe park around the castle is stunning and beautiful, the scenery of the castle itself it's magical.\n\nTo get into the castle, you need to walk up some stairs, so be aware of this walk up.\nWhen you reach near the castle entrance, you have two options going up by stairs all the way up to the ninth floor or taking the elevator until the seventh floor and then do the last two floors my stairs.\nWhen you're on the top floor, you have a very nice panorama view over the garden and see the skyline of the city Osaka.\n\nI was a little bit, disappointed about the insight, although they do a lot of storytelling on every floor.\nBut it was a bit busy so hard to read slowly all the storytelling. But it was very well organized and guided by museum employees.\n\nDue, I was staying in Osaka It was a must visit place and I still don't regret it.",

However the entry fee into the castle itself is not worth the entry fee. Partly because you the castle is practically empty and you don't see much inside. The observation deck is nice to see but again due to the outside railings you cannot get good photographs or videos. You can get very nice photos of the castle itself on the grounds without paying entry. The entry is 1200 Yen per person. I would recommend you buy online as you you do not have to que with online tickets. It does get busy very quickly. I would recommend you bring water there yourself as they overcharge for water on site and near by. You only need to pay entry directly at the castle entrance itself there by you can explore the grounds and surrounding areas for no entry fee. As the castle is quite big the best photographs are taken from the grounds and not inside the castle grounds itself.",

Everything was perfectly organized, and the overall experience was seamless.\n\nThe park itself is on another level - the design, the attractions, the atmosphere… it's by far the best theme park I've ever been to.

The layout of this place is awesome with one massive central tank that has an incredible diversity of sea animals including the 2 whale sharks. The surrounding smaller tanks are also awesome as they all contain such unique ecosystems. Conveniently being located right by a shopping mall allows this place to be a full day event as well. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and I would be sure to quickly get through the first half as the latter half is much less crowded with people.",

We were impressed by the layout of this aquarium - you take the escalators up to the top and then you slowly work your way down in a circular motion around the main central tank, ensuring that you don't miss anything and that the flow of people is smooth and organized. The crowds were tolerable - lots of people but not in a chaotic way. As you work your way down, you see fish and other aquatic life from different areas of the world from playful otters to curious dolphins to energetic sea lions to laid back penguins and much more. The star of the show is the central tank with the gigantic and majestic whale sharks. One could spend hours admiring them, and some do. Allow at least 2 hours to see the aquarium, though 3 hours will allow more time to sit and admire the animals more, plus explore the gift shop at the end.",

Right in front of the iconic Glico sign, the atmosphere is absolutely magical-full of life, color, and neon lights reflecting off the canal, creating a living postcard.

The Japanese restaurants nearby were incredibly delicious, offering a true taste of local cuisine. You can even take a boat ride along the canal to see the area from a different perspective.\n\nDotonbori is one of those places you have to see to believe.

While the grounds themselves are modest compared to larger complexes like Sumiyoshi Taisha, the centerpiece-a massive lion head-shaped stage (shishi-guchi)-makes this shrine unforgettable. Standing 12 meters tall and 11 meters wide, the lion's open mouth is said to swallow evil spirits and misfortune, while amplifying good luck, especially in areas like business success and academic achievement.\n\nThe contrast between the shrine's serene atmosphere and the bold, theatrical design of the lion head creates a unique energy. It's a popular spot for locals seeking blessings, and for travelers looking for a photogenic slice of Osaka's spiritual culture. The shrine also hosts seasonal festivals, including the lively Setsubun bean-throwing ceremony and summer rituals that blend tradition with community spirit.\n\nDespite its central location, Namba Yasaka Jinja feels tucked away-almost like a hidden gem. It's easily accessible from Namba Station, making it a convenient detour between shopping sprees or food crawls. Whether you're there to pray, snap a photo, or simply soak in the atmosphere, this shrine offers a bold, memorable twist on Japan's sacred architecture.",

The best thing about this building is that not only does it offer incredible views of the city both day and night (we recommend visiting during sunset for that gorgeous warm glow or at night when the building lights are twinkling), but riding in the spectacular escalator which connects the two buildings that make up the Umea Sky Building is quite an experience in itself!",

There were a lot of people but it never felt crowded. Edge The Harukas - their sky walk activity available by schedule or if weather is permitting.

Highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a city garden for hydrangeas and especially those who are having an afternoon flight back home!",

These are apparently placed there to occupy your time while you twiddle your thumbs waiting for the final elevator ride. Great views but at a great cost to your time. The sign said 30 minutes...but it was 45 or more till we got out of the second elevator. But wait, you also have a line to get down. It goes faster, but I am not sure why they don't let you walk down. That would have been fun. This is not as efficient as most things are in Japan. Be willing to give up 2 to 3 hours even on a fast day. I wouldn't personally prioritize this. Seen one historic tower, you've probably seen them all. Nice to see from the outside, but the inside is a real time killer. If you do go, you also have the option to go to the roof ...that would have taken even more time and have been anticlimactic.",

This museum is an excellent destination for anyone with an interest in science, history, or natural wonders. Although we arrived late and didn't have time to explore the adjacent botanical garden, the museum itself was well worth the visit.\n\nOne of the highlights of the museum is its impressive collection of dinosaur bones and fossils. The exhibits are thoughtfully arranged, with detailed explanations that make the information accessible and engaging for visitors of all ages. Walking through the displays feels like stepping into a different era, and it's fascinating to learn about the history of life on Earth.\n\nThe museum is also very family-friendly. Kids, in particular, will love the dinosaur exhibits and interactive displays, making it a great place for a family outing. The educational aspect of the museum is balanced with a sense of fun and discovery, ensuring that both children and adults stay engaged throughout the visit.\n\nThe facility is well-maintained and clean, with a layout that is easy to navigate. The staff were friendly and helpful, and it's clear that a lot of effort goes into keeping the exhibits up to date and informative.\n\nAlthough we missed the botanical garden due to time constraints, the museum itself was a fantastic experience. If you're in Osaka and have a few hours to spare, I highly recommend a visit to the Osaka Museum of Natural History. It's a great blend of education and entertainment, perfect for families, couples, or solo travelers.",

It's a super relaxing place, and there were many people doing picnics in the grass which seems like a nice idea. Especially on a day with good weather, Kema Sakuranomiya park is a must. 🏢🌸🌳",

            "text": "Kema Sakuranomiya Park (毛馬桜之宮公園 – Osaka, Japan)\n\nKema Sakuranomiya Park is one of Osaka's most underrated yet stunning riverside parks, especially famous during cherry blossom season. Stretching along the Okawa River between Temmabashi and Sakuranomiya stations, this linear park offers over 4 kilometers of walking paths lined with approximately 5,000 cherry trees, making it one of the best hanami (flower viewing) spots in the city.\n\nIn spring, the entire riverside transforms into a tunnel of soft pink blossoms. The petals often fall gently into the river, creating a romantic, postcard-perfect scene. Unlike the busier Osaka Castle Park or Kema Sakuranomiya's neighbor, Nakanoshima, this park has a more relaxed, local vibe, ideal for quiet strolls, picnics, or photography.\n\nEven outside of sakura season, the park remains a peaceful getaway with wide open lawns, scenic bridges, and historic buildings like the Japan Mint, which also opens its gates to the public during cherry blossom week.\n\nTip: Visit early in the morning during sakura season to avoid crowds and catch the soft light. Bring a picnic or enjoy a riverside coffee from a nearby café. Easily accessible by JR Sakuranomiya Station, Kema Sakuranomiya Park is a perfect mix of nature, culture, and seasonal beauty - right in the heart of Osaka.",
