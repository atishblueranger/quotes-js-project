You can choose to pay 600 for audio guide (option to use their website with your own earpiece, instead of their equipment).\n\nI think the guide is good, but the sequence is all jumbled up and many of the art listed in the audio guide was not on display. A large large majority of the artwork do not have any associated audio guide for it. I think the arrangement of the artwork could be much better and integrate more with the audio guide.\n\nRecommended to spend 1.5 to 2 hrs to slowly view each artwork and listen to the audio guide. But if you rush, you can probably finish the tour in 1 hr.\n\nThe Hiroshima Museum of Art was more enjoyable :)",

Depending on where you are staying, you may have to take a short streetcar ride to the park.  Then walk on the promenade along the Asahi River to the castle. The castle is so beautiful on the outside, with the surrounding grounds complementing its beauty. Once you enter the castle, you step into an incredible museum of Okayama and the history of the castle. Some articles you are unable to take photos of, so keep it in mind as you view each floor. I did ask if photos are okay prior to starting to review the exhibitions. On the top floor, you can see the whole area of Okayama, where it is quite scenic. A very interesting history of Okayama. If you have the opportunity, go towards the early evening when the lighting complements the castle at night and it's cooler outside.",

Beware that the price of the jeans are above average (depending on where you live) the cheapest pair we found was about 18,000 yen and the most expensive was 60,000 yen but if you want you can spend a lot more on a pair if you order and want them fitted.",

A small note about the room - it was a little tricky for me to get the temperature right. (If I remember right, the dial was either \"on\" or \"off\"/not temperature adjustable?) I opened the window because it got too stuffy, but it was a chilly night, so I woke up with a mild cold, haha. But overall, it was a very nice stay! Thank you!",
