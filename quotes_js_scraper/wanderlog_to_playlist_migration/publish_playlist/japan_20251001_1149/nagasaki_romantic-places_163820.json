There are two old clocks that stopped at the very moment of the blast.\n\nWe spent quite a bit of time in the section that featured the memories and comments of those who initially survived the blast, and how they tried to cope with the loss of the loved ones and their homes.\n\nOther exhibits include the development of the atomic bomb, as well as the nuclear arms race since then.\n\nThere is parking immediately at the side of the building, and you can also go up to the observation deck at the top of the garden.\n\nThere is a small cafe, appropriately called Peace Cafe, where you can grab a drink and a cake.  There are many strands of origami cranes made by locals and visitors, symbolising the hope for peace.",

It is popular so at 5PM on a Sunday, about an hour before sunset, most seats were already taken. It is ranked as one of Japan's top 3 night views and offers great night scenery of the harbour, surrounding mountains, and city below. You can buy sweets and warm drinks from the vending machine or desserts from the shop outside. To access the area you can take the ropeway for 730円 (one way) or 1250円 (round trip), departing every 15-20 minutes from 9:00-22:00. Or you can do what we did, which is take the bus (every 30 minutes) to Inasayama bus stop (15 minutes, 190円 one way from Nagasaki Station) + 15 minute walk up a concrete path and stairs to the summit. Near the bus stop there is a small zoo with deer and monkeys which you can feed for 100円 from the designated vending machines.",

            "text": "Mt. Inasa Overlook offers one of the best night views in Japan - or so they say, and honestly, I believe it. The view was stunning. City lights stretching across Nagasaki Bay, mountains in the background, and a peaceful stillness in the air that made it feel almost surreal. It's one of those places that makes you pause and just take it all in.\nThe gondola ride up was smooth, easy, and not overly crowded. I was lucky - my car wasn't sardined at all, though I heard from friends theirs got a little packed. Still, the ride is short and scenic, so either way, it's part of the experience.\nAt the top, there's a round building where you can either walk or take the elevator up. Inside, you get a panoramic view through glass, but the real magic is outside - go up a short flight of stairs and you'll reach the roof deck, where the full 360-degree view hits different. Breezy, calm, and absolutely worth it.\nIf you're in Nagasaki, do this at night. It's peaceful, romantic, and just a little magical. A perfect ending to the day, or a highlight all on its own.\nI wonder how it looks in the day time, I was one of the last gondola to go up.",

The park is dedicated to the memory of the victims of the atomic bombing on August 9, 1945, but it's also a place filled with messages of hope, peace, and resilience.\n\nThe park is beautifully laid out-green, serene, and spacious. At its center is the towering Peace Statue, with one hand pointing to the sky as a warning of the threat of nuclear weapons, and the other hand extended in a gesture of peace. Standing in front of it, you can't help but feel the weight of history, yet the message is one of healing and forward-looking unity.\n\nAs we walked through the park, we saw monuments and sculptures donated by countries from all over the world, each with their own interpretation of peace. It was moving to see how many nations have contributed to this space, each offering their support and solidarity with Nagasaki's message.\n\nA short walk from the main plaza leads to the Nagasaki Peace Bell, which visitors are invited to ring. The sound it produces is gentle but haunting, and it felt like a personal moment of reflection. Nearby, the Fountain of Peace was also very touching-built to honor the memory of children and victims who died crying out for water after the bombing.\n\nWhat struck me most was the calmness of the park. Despite its tragic past, the space feels peaceful, dignified, and alive with meaning. It's a place not just for remembrance, but for reflection and hope.\n\nIf you're in Nagasaki, a visit to Peace Park is not only recommended-it's essential. It's more than just a tourist attraction; it's a place that stays with you long after you leave.",

There are two ways to get to the base of the ropeway station. Either the free shuttle bus (needs reservations) or the public bus (not too expensive either). If going by public bus late at night, be aware that you need to take the 9:30 pm ropeway down to make it for the last departing bus. If you miss this, you'd either need to walk or take the taxi to the station which also isn't too far (20 mins walk).\n2. It is cold and windy at the top!! We went during spring but the cold was close to unbearable even with my layers. Dress appropriately to fully enjoy the nightview.",

Despite being just 500 meters from the bomb's hypocenter, it was completely destroyed.",

Urakami Cathedral was originally built to serve the many kakure kirishitan (Hidden Christians), who had retained a version of their faith during the times of persecution under the Tokugawa regime in the Edo Period of Japanese history (1603-1867).",
