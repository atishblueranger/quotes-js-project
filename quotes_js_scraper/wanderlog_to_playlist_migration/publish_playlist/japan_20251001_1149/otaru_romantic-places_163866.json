Moiwa Ropeway is where it's at.\n\nThe ride up is smooth, scenic, and quick. First, you hop on a ropeway that glides over lush green hills, and then transfer to a cute little mini cable car that brings you right to the summit. At the top? A 360° panoramic view of Sapporo, the mountains, and on clear days, even the sea. It's a whole vibe-especially as the sun starts to dip and the lights of the city flicker on.\n\nThere's a café and a small observation deck (which can get crowded at golden hour), but honestly, the view does all the heavy lifting. There's even a “lovers' bell” and lock wall if you're feeling romantic-or just want an excuse to ring a bell and make a wish.\n\n💡 Pro tip: Time it right-arrive about 45–60 minutes before sunset to beat the crowds and snag the best spot. And bring a jacket. Even in summer, that mountain breeze means business.",

Next table ordered strawberry Mont Blanc but sorry we just took the last one.\n\n• Double fromage - Original one. Tried frozen one from airport before. Of course, fresh from the place is way better.\n• Strawberry Mont Blanc - Seasonal offer. I found strawberry flavors pretty weak. Chestnut wins.\n• Chocolate double fromage - just okay for me.\n• Iced tea & hot coffee - nothing outstanding.\n\n• Price - Set menu is pretty awesome & reasonable.\n• Worth waiting? - If you just sit & wait for longer than 30 minutes, no - not worth it.

Their cafe above the store offers a delightful selection of beautifully plated desserts that are both visually appealing and tasty.\n\nI ordered both of their shop-limited sets. I think their signature Double Fromage Cheesecake lived up to the hype in terms of its light and airy texture. The level of sweetness was just about right. The baked cheesecake had a more traditional, dense body, with a slightly caramelized top that added some depth. The chocolate cake was rich and overall satisfying, although I found the cream layers a bit too heavy for my taste.\n\nWhile everything was delicious, it didn't quite exceed my expectations (hence the 4/5 stars). Not to say the food was bad, but it just felt a bit “ordinary” and was just lacking something (that would make the difference between good and excellent!).\n\nIf you're short on time, you can also grab takeaway items from the ground floor. But to fully appreciate the presentation and experience, I recommend actually taking the time to queue up and take a seat.",

To get here from Otaru station by taxi is about 2,500-3000 yen so bottom line it is 8,000 yen per person.  The tour includes showing the tanks and equipments used to make the wine and a video of how wide the vineyard is.  It took an hour and then followed at the tasting room that is dark and quiet, no no sounds at all.  We were given small amounts of wine, maybe about 10 ml per tasting, 6 kinds and no additional.  The pairing food was just cheese with very small amount.  This does even meet the value of spending 8,000 yen to visit.  In tokyo if you pay this much, you get a whole plate of high quality cheese that you can even take home.  This winery needs to study on pairing as well as how to satisfy customers that are visiting from far away.  The winery needs to realize that customers are spending a lot of monies to visit and should at least try to make the spending and visit worthy of the money spent.  The tour guide was nice and tried his best but you are far far away from winery tours that are held in mainland Japan. You need a lot more improvement.  As of this time , i would not recommend this tour for others.",

Compared to other Japanese restaurants I've tried in various cities, the food here is just average. The service was somewhat slow, though the staff remained friendly and attentive.\nOne thing to note - their reservation system requires your entire party to be present before you can be added to the queue, which can be inconvenient if you're hungry. If you're really hungry and need a place to eat, it's acceptable, but don't expect exceptional Japanese cuisine. The good service somewhat makes up for the average food quality, but overall it's not as impressive as it apparently once was.",
