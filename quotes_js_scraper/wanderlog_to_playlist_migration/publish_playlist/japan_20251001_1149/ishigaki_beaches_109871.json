Unfortunately lots of Japanese people come here to do photoshootings and are using drones which is extremely annoying and disrespectful for other visitors. Disallowing drones on this beach would really help to maintain the beauty and tranquility of this place. Be aware of crows that try to steal stuff from your bag.",

You can see peacocks on the way if you go early and quiet enough. It's isolated so there's hardly every anyone here but it's still a beautiful beach, especially the view. Great place to watch the sun rise, and also the snorkeling is really good, the water stays around 6-10 foot deep for at least a mile or so out. I didn't feel in any danger swimming way out, and the further you go the more you see. Lots of fish, and I even saw a sea turtle, needle fish, puffer fish, and a small sea snake. The beach itself has some trash on it but that seems unfortunately more do do with the current and ocean trash washing ashore than littering guests. Still, the water and reef are clean.",
