If I had known this beforehand, I would not have gone because I have severe back pain. You can't even sit on the floor.\n\nThere are some places to take pictures, but if you ask the staff there, they won't take pictures, you have to ask the person behind the line to take pictures. So it's better if you can go with your own group.\n\nOverall I don't like it.",

In a country where they can be a bit hit and miss, the permanent collection was beautifully presented in a large atmospheric black hall, with excellent English language explanations, taking you from prehistoric up until 19th C history, focusing especially on the cultural and trade exchange between Japan and Asia. There are some absolute gems of statues, vases, scrolls and paintings among the collection.\n\nAt the front desk, I was advised around 40 mins was enough to see the collection, but 1.5 hours was just enough to get to the end.\n\nIf you chose one museum around Fukuoka, I'd make it this one for sure (the Fukuoka City museum feels dated and mundane in comparison).",

However, we only traveled from Flower Hill to the jumping area, so the bike wasn't really necessary. Another thing to note is that bicycles are only allowed on the outer paths and not in the central areas. That said, if you enjoy cycling, it's still a nice option to have.\n\nOur child absolutely loved the giant jumping area, and the blue nemophila flowers were beautiful-great for photos. It's a pity we didn't plan for a longer visit; you could easily spend the whole day here.\n\nWe saw groups of kindergarten, elementary, and middle school students on field trips. The park is well-maintained, with plenty of trash bins and restrooms. There are even a few drinking fountains where you press a button and drink from the water stream directly.",

It was hot when I went there so most of the animals are taking nap, I probably will go for second time in fall because they have the area specific for autumn plants.\nFor meal, the restaurant by the entry is about 1500yen per dish and the one by botanical garden is like 1000yen on average. The closing hour 4:30, it's better if you go in the early morning if you want to take your time to enjoy the whole park. Def recommended :)",

Canal City is conveniently accessible at one end of Kawabata Shopping Arcade.\n\nOn the second day, we had a body and feet massage. Very reasonable rates. Looking forward to coming back for more. There are several massage parlors to choose.\n\nFound this ramen place that serves gyoza, fried rice and fried chicken. Definitely one of the better places to eat! Firm noodles, shorter noodles to slurp, tasty broth and melt in your mouth roast pork. Fried rice comes on a hot sizzling plate. Gyoza with 3 sauces. Condiments available.",

I took the bus which use the PASMO and it is super convenient, around 20 mins from city center. Just remember Japanese bus entrance is from the back unlike Singapore which is the fronts. :)",

The market is relatively small and can be explored in about 30 minutes or less.\n\nCompared to larger markets like Kuromon, this one is more compact, but it does have its charm. There are a few small restaurants offering chirashidon and sashimi rice bowls. During our visit, there was one stall serving fresh sashimi for immediate consumption, with a small table set up where you could enjoy it with soy sauce and wasabi-it was fresh and tasty.\n\nWe also tried the stall selling assorted fish cakes. If you mention you'll eat them right away, they'll warm them up for you on the spot, which was a nice touch.\n\nThe market includes a small lounge area with seating, a vending machine for drinks, and a restroom for convenience.\n\nWhile it may not be a must-visit if you're tight on time, it's worth checking out if you're nearby and in the mood for good quality sashimi at an affordable price.",

If you're going as a twosome, I'd recommend the counter to get a front row seat to the kitchen, but the tables provide a nice intimate aside to the busy atmosphere in the center of the restaurant where the kitchen is.\n\nEach dish was artistically plated with flavor combinations that were unexpected yet pleasant. Our fish was a maguro steak that was quite meaty, and our meat was Kyushu venison with foie gras cubes underneath. Both were absolutely delicious and the course in of itself was filling. Bread is constantly being re-supplied to the table, and non-alcoholic cocktails are on the menu for designated drivers and pregnant pals as well.\n\nFor 5,500en a head, it's a fun dinner spot with a lot of creativity and fun flavors that will keep you talking if you run out of other fun things to talk about.",
