When I tell you that this was my best experience yet, I mean it!\nOriginally my fiancé and I had stopped by just to get information on the pricing, but due to us having mild Japanese language skills, we ended up buying the service and going in immediately.\nBy the way, tattoos are allowed~!\n\nStaff: The staff was very friendly and helpful. Their English is good enough to explain everything, as well as the signage being in English as well.\n\nCost: I believe it was 1,300 yen per person (or maybe that was for both of us?) for access to the baths, sauna and rental towels, which is extremely cheap in my opinion!\n\nServices: here are three baths that vary in size and temperature.\nThe biggest bath is the hottest, but not as hot as some I've been in previously. (This is a good thing because I was able to stay in much longer than usual without getting overheated.)\nThe medium bath is carbonated and has a cooler temperature, but is still pretty warm. If you're not good with high heat, I recommend trying this bath first!\nThe smallest bath is cold, which is great for when you're overheated. I saw some Japanese people use their bowls to take water out for a quick rinse, but I personally enjoyed using it as a cold plunge.\nThere is also a sauna which costs more then the baths-only, but I highly recommend it. I enjoyed sweating in the dry heat after spending some time in the baths. The sauna room smells like a campfire (loved this) and has some sounds that were nice to listen to while I meditated.\n\nOverall: Definitely a hidden gem in the Kamata area, and one of the best onsen experiences I've had during any of my trips to Japan.\nIf you're in the area and wondering if you should visit: DO IT! Your body will thank you!",
