If Meiji-jingu is the Marcia Brady of shrines and Senso-ji is the Cindy Brady of temples, then Nezu Shrine is definitely poor, overlooked Jan Brady. \"Meiji! Meiji! Meiji!\" Personally I had never heard of Nezu before.\n\nMy husband and I only discovered this somewhat hidden shrine on a random walk we took from Ueno Park to Yanaka Ginza. The first thing we noticed was how tranquil the grounds were compared to Marcia and Cindy, I mean, Meiji-jingu and Senso-ji. Apparently, spring brings an explosion of azaleas, but we mostly missed it. Much like when Jan missed making the final cut during cheerleader tryouts.\n\nThe shrine's history dates back 19 centuries and has remained relatively intact through earthquakes, world wars, and climate change. They have quite an extensive tunnel of vermillion torii gates. Not as impressive as Fushimi Inari in Kyoto, but it still made for a prime Instagram moment as did all the stone statues of foxes serving as protectors of the shrine and messengers of prosperity. So I guess the foxes would be like the guardians of the Brady Bunch Variety Hour. Say what?",
