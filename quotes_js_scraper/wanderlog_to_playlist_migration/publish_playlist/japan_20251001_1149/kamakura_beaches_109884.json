            "text": "A Serene Beach Escape Near Tokyo – The Perfect Spot to Enjoy Nature\n\nIf you're looking for a peaceful beach getaway where you can truly immerse yourself in nature, this is the place to be. Located just under an hour from Tokyo, it offers a refreshing escape from the city's fast-paced energy. The moment you arrive, you'll notice the crystal-clear water and the calm, gentle waves, making it an ideal spot for swimming, sunbathing, or simply relaxing by the shore. Unlike many other beaches, this one is remarkably clean, with very little litter, allowing visitors to fully enjoy the natural beauty without distractions.\n\nOne of the best things about this location is the balance between tranquility and convenience. While the beach itself is serene and uncrowded, there are plenty of restaurants and cafes nearby, making it easy to grab a delicious meal or a refreshing drink after a day by the sea. Whether you're planning a romantic getaway, a solo retreat, or a fun day out with friends and family, this beach has something for everyone.\n\nFor those who love photography or simply enjoy breathtaking views, the scenery here is spectacular-especially during sunrise and sunset, when the sky paints the ocean in stunning shades of orange and pink. If you're looking for a stress-free, nature-filled beach experience without traveling too far from Tokyo, this hidden gem is an absolute must-visit!",

Tere were not a lot of people. You are met by a sign explaining the rules at the beach and considering that I have large tattoos over my body, I decided that I won't try my luck, so I just dipped my toes. The water was very warm, the sand is fine - like silk. At this time the beach was relatively quiet, considering that it's the beginning of the school year and it's kind of late. I managed to capture the sun going down - beautiful and fulfilling picture.\nThere are some bars and other venues which I did not visit, because it was after or near their closing time.\nThe beach was generally clean, but still there was some trash left here and there (also some thrown by the sea), hence the 4 stars.\nStill a great place to visit!",

Litter is rare because it's regularly maintained. Unfortunately, the water in the bay tells a different story, it's dirty and filled with trash, which is disappointing to see.\n\nThe beach area itself is spacious, and when we visited in mid-August, the water was wonderfully warm, so warm that you didn't want to get out, if not for the scorching sun and blazing heat above.\n\nFacilities are abundant: there are many beach bars, showers, lifeguard stations, and plenty of rental spots where you can get sunbeds, umbrellas, and all kinds of water toys and gear.\n\nBut here comes the worst part, the toilets.

Also helped me call a taxi even helped me pull my luggage to outside waiting for me get on the cab and left ! It's so rare even in Taiwan they won't help you to do that ! The food I had the night before was super tasty . It's next to the guesthouse, I think it's also belonging to the guesthouse, because the staff was the same guy who help me carry my luggage upstairs. I chose grilled steak with veggies and the appetite was also great ! Super delicious! It even tastes better than a proper restaurant! And people were in the bar super friendly and helped me up my journey in Kamakura told me which ways I go would saved my time. Let me feel super warm and like that place so much ! One day trip was too short there are so many beautiful places to see ! I would definitely come back again and stay more days here next year! Thanks for helping me ! ❤️",

The price is reasonable and size of the room is good enough for 1 people or 2 skinny people.\n\nHowever the wall is extremely thinnnnnn, the girl next to me, she talks on the phone all the time and I can hear her very clearly just like she is sitting right next to me, and I asked her to be quite and she said okay but reminded me that it's not 11pm yet.\n\nHonestly I would rather stay in a capsule hotel than the guesthouse like this. Cuz most of the people from outside of Japan don't really care about others, like living in a guesthouse like this, especially the wall is thin, I mean you can talk but just lower down your voice and respect others, jeez.",
