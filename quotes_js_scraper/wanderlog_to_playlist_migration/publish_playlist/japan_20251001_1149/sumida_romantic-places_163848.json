After a quick and easy train ride, we arrived and had dinner in the surrounding complex before heading toward the ticket counter. Unfortunately, we arrived just a few minutes before closing and missed the last admission time, so we weren't able to go up the tower that night.\n\nEven though we didn't make it to the top, the visit still turned out to be worthwhile. The tower itself is massive and really impressive, especially at night. It was fully illuminated and the colours changed periodically, cycling through purples, blues, reds, and a stunning rainbow display at one point. I was able to get several photos from different angles on our walk up to the tower, and it still felt like a great experience even without going to the top.\n\nThe whole area around the base is clean, modern, and easy to navigate, with shopping, restaurants, and a very open plaza for photos. I'll definitely come back earlier next time to enjoy the observation deck and views over Tokyo, but even just seeing the tower up close was worth the visit.",

Seeing it in person absolutely lived up to expectations. The view from the Main Deck at 150 metres was stunning, with a full panoramic scene of Tokyo's sparkling skyline. I stayed up there for around 40 minutes taking in the sights and snapping photos from multiple angles.\n\nTokyo Tower stands at 333 metres tall and was inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, though it's slightly taller. Built in 1958, it originally served as a television broadcasting antenna and remains one of the city's iconic landmarks. Its red-and-white design stands out beautifully, especially when lit up at night.\n\nThe atmosphere on the observation deck was relaxed, and there was plenty of room to enjoy the views without feeling crowded. The night lighting changes seasonally, which adds something a little different if you visit at various times of year. You can also explore souvenir shops, grab a drink, or check out the FootTown building underneath with its mini attractions and eateries.\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Tokyo, I'd definitely recommend adding this to your evening plans. It's especially ideal for photographers and anyone wanting a breathtaking, elevated view of the city.",

Other than observation decks, there are multiple gift shops, restaurants and gallery at this location. We bought our tickets online few days in advance to reserve the date and time. Upon arrival we checked-in at the counter. Guests need to arrive during their ticket slots or they might not allow them to get in at another time.\n\nThe walkway to the elevator was a nice historical gallery of how the tower was made. Then the elevator took us to the first observation deck where we were greeted with juices and alcohol drinks. Here we also took a souvenir photo that was included with the ticket. We hopped on another elevator that took us the higher observation deck. It had some really nice 360 view of Tokyo. Because of the haze, the skyline was not so clear. We spent about 15 minutes here, since there wasn't much to see other than the city skyline.\n\nThen we head back to the lower deck that had gift shop, glass see thru floor and larger windows with city view. Here we spent about another 20 minutes. The gift shop had excellent items. I got a small replica of the tower and few other stuff from the shop.\n\nFinally we head down the main entrance where we explored the bigger gift shop. It had way more items like tower coin chocolates, bakery items and an ice cream shop. There was also a gallery and restrooms.  Overall we had a wonderful time here. Enjoyed the sight and the shopping. It's very clean and maintained. Absolutely recommend for anyone visiting Tokyo.",

Though it was a unique and stunning experience, there were really no surprises. Some have said you can easily spend three hours there however I found after an hour I'd had enough. I went at the end of the day so my feet were sore and I was getting tired which didn't help. I have to admit I found the exhibits though visually amazing they lacked meaning. The reason most of the great works of art from the middle ages are religious is because they inspired people on more than just the visual level. Here it was something of an empty, soulless place which unfortunately mirrors the secular society we are living in. This place could have had amazing potential however I found it a little underwhelming. Despite this I would recommend going if you feel it's your thing.",

I was honestly overwhelmed at first, but once I took a breath and followed the signs, it all started to make sense.\n\nThe amount of food available inside is almost ridiculous (in the best way). PLENTY of options, which is on I believe the East? side of the station. Along with a row of giftshops, I forgot what they called it, but you can't miss it.\n\nFrom quick snacks to full meals, you could easily get lost in the station's many underground food halls and still not try everything. There's a lot to explore, so arriving early is a smart move, especially if you're unfamiliar with the layout. It gives you time to find your platform, maybe grab a bite, and even store your bags.\n\nSpeaking of which, the locker system is amazing - easy to use and super convenient if you're carrying luggage or shopping bags. I had a Shinkansen to catch, and the reserved seats were a lifesaver. I used a kiosk to print my ticket, which saved time and stress. Despite the crowds, Tokyo Station delivers a smooth, well-managed experience. It's intense, but it works.",

Somehow, so many this year great for photography.  The feel of the thousands of wind chimes and sounds gives a one of a kind experience!

One of the things I appreciated most was that it wasn't overly crowded, which made the whole experience feel more peaceful and enjoyable. Out of all the parks I visited in Tokyo, this one easily had the most stunning scenery-lush greenery, serene water views, and beautifully maintained landscapes that felt almost like stepping into a painting. The air was noticeably fresh and clean, adding to the overall sense of calm. I highly recommend trying the boating experience here-it was both relaxing and fun, offering a unique way to take in the natural beauty of the park. It's definitely a hidden gem and a great escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.",

We planned to come here a week before, but it was raining for days. Good thing we waited for that beautiful, sunny day.\n\nDefinitely coming back here in the future.\n\nTips:\n- The best route is from the exit of Kudanshita Station.\n- There are approximately 1,000 sakura trees. According to their billboard, you can donate to the park if you want to help protect these poor trees from the effects of climate change.\n- According to the signs, you can't use tripod.\n- The line for the boat is already long when we passed by at 8am. They start operations at 9am.\n- Night lights turn on from sunset to 10pm.",

As a group, we bought some souvenirs, but quickly realized that better or cheaper options were just a few meters away, so a bit of patience pays off.\n\nThe street is lively and vibrant, with plenty to see, but the highlight is at the end: a beautiful shrine that reminds you to be respectful and mindful of local customs. Overall, it's worth visiting for the atmosphere and sights, but go prepared for crowds, heat, and careful shopping.\n\nTip: Bring water, go early to avoid the peak sun, and take time to enjoy the shrine at the end.",

He was a Japanese poet and calligrapher known as The Poet of Zen. Even though I couldn't read his work in Japanese, the museum translated it into English. I was still able to understand his meaning and enjoyed my visit.",
