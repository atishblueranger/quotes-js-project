To get to the top, head to the cable car entrance, buy your ticket, and take the first cable car followed by another small train-like lift. The whole journey doesn't take too long, and the view at the top is absolutely worth it. It gets quite chilly up there, even in summer, so bring an extra layer. There's also a restaurant at the summit, but you'll need to book several weeks in advance. Just be prepared for a bit of a queue when heading back down after sunset. Would definitely recommend it.",

By the time we got to the top it was dark (beautiful view) but also very cold. The line to get back down went up 2-3 stairways and outside in the freezing cold. Probably around a 2-3 hour wait. We panicked. We finally figured there was a road to the middle larger lift so walked down the stairs to two small glass exit doors and went out. Used our phone flashlights to take us down a beautiful path to the middle level. Saved the day, but the people there said there was no way to walk down. Wrong! Thank goodness, we got down in good time but they were still allowing hundreds up. Bypass this is you care about time or kids who might suffer in long lines.",
