The main highlight was the beautiful panoramic view of the ocean with the buildings below surrounding the coast. You could also get some regular and limited edition goshuin here as well.\n\nOverall, highly recommend spending some time here to soak in the peace and tranquility with an epic view of the ocean and breather in the fresh air without being overwhelmed by tourists!",
