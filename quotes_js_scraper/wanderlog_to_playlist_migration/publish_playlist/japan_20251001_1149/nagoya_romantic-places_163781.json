It is one of the most important shrines in Japan, as it enshrines Kusanagi no Tsurugi, one of the three sacred treasures of the Japanese imperial regalia.\n\nThe moment you step into the shrine grounds, you can feel the peaceful and serene atmosphere. Centuries-old trees surround the area, creating a calming environment. Despite being located in a bustling city, entering this place feels like stepping into another world.\n\nAtsuta Shrine is deeply revered, especially among the Japanese, who often come here to pray for good fortune, protection, and success in life. The shrine features worship areas and a grand torii gate, a symbolic element of Shinto shrines.\n\nI am truly delighted to have visited this remarkable place and to have experienced the beauty and deep cultural heritage of Japan.",

I suggest you go early as the zoo and botanical garden has wide area. Also, bring in some onigiris or any conbini food as these are much cheaper. I went in Sakura Season! I happen to witness Sakura in this area, so beautiful!\n\nAs you enter the Zoo, take the Zoo Map with you as ur guide around :)\n\nPS. You should also try to go to Sky Tower while you're in the zoo for a complete experience :)",

Compared to zoos around the Tokyo area, the entrance fee here is really affordable - only 640 yen for a combined ticket to the zoo and the Higashiyama Sky Tower. It's a great deal for everything you get to see and do.\n\nOne thing that really impressed me was how close you can get to the animals. You get a much more personal view compared to many other zoos. It made the experience very memorable!\n\nThere's also a nice food court area in the middle of the park with a good variety of restaurants, perfect for taking a break and enjoying a meal.\n\nThe park is spacious, full of greenery, and has a relaxing atmosphere. The view from the lake area with the swan boats and the Sky Tower in the background was beautiful too.\n\nHighly recommend visiting if you're in Aichi Prefecture - great for families, couples, or anyone who loves animals and nature!",

After leaving Mexico City's free zoo and botanical gardens I figured I wouldn't be able to give out anymore 5 star reviews for paid experiences. I was wrong...\n\nThis combo pack makes the San Diego Zoo feel like even more of a confusing experience for the price paid. Maybe it's an exchange rate thing, maybe it's about the number of animals, in the end I just don't know.\n\nI made it clear in my last review that I was not a huge fan of animals in captivity, but being on an island made me feel less bad about it. It's not like this Japan is so big that a theoretical habit could exist for these animals somewhere else on the island.\n\nI wasn't visiting the zoo, but the layout of the habits was so well done, I found myself stopping by to see some rare sights. In other zoos, the line to see koalas is so long that I've never actually seen a live one, so it was quite the experience.\n\nThe weather was cold so bears had climbed the trees to sleep in the sun and I think it could have been the cutest thing I've ever seen.\n\nI also stopped by to see the giraffes, which were close to the front, but when feeding happens they eat right in front of you as the hanging baskets of food draw them towards visitors. Very smart placement.\n\nI saw some other animals, but I was really there for cherry blossoms, and the botanical gardens didn't disappoint. The cherry blossoms, along with many other flowers, were in full bloom and everyone was enjoying themselves.\n\nThe garden section is way bigger than I imagined and I admit fatigue kicked in so I didn't even get to see everything I wanted.\n\nThe venue also includes a wedding hall that makes you look like you're a baller, a huge glass atrium, an observation deck, and a train that tours the park. As a visitor, you definitely get your money's worth.\n\nWild...",

As with all theme parks of course.\n\nSo a couple of things to expect like all theme parks: food will be more expensive, tickets will be of a price tag.\n\nFor this, car park, follow the instructions by the website where you park nearby within walking distance with a good rate, especially weekday. Lots of car park, if you can get the floor where the connecting bridge that would be great but not necessary.\n\nTickets, recommend to buy online in advance for discounts.\n\nAll the rides are within the costs of your tickets so have fun inside. Lots of kiddies rides but adults can have fun too, weekdays have less crowds so not much queue.\n\nThe park has different themes so go to everyone to discover, some maybe closed, check on the updates on website. Note the closing time. Look out for mascots to have pictures with them.\n\nThere's a little Japan where I recommend to go view their amazing works.\n\nFood while a little more expensive, but still as yummy and interesting way to order for one particular restaurant .",

I loved the idea of playing with blocks while waiting in the line for an attraction. Small kids don't like waiting and they are not used to spending waiting time on smartphones like adults, so putting there Lego to play was an  amazing idea. I wish other places were also that thoughtful about small kids.\nOn the other hand, it's quite expensive and the food is really really bad (if possible do not eat there at all!). I wish the management redesigned the menu and focused on the taste and not just the appearance.",

The entire park is filled with structures and characters built from LEGO bricks - it's not just fun for kids, even adults can enjoy it just as much.\n\nThe park isn't overly large, but the layout is well-designed. Each themed area, such as Adventure Zone, Miniland, and the water park, has its own charm and offers great photo opportunities. The attractions range from thrilling roller coasters to gentle rides for younger children. Many of the activities are interactive and involve building or solving puzzles, which makes the experience both fun and educational for kids.\n\nThere are also plenty of souvenir shops throughout the park, and if you're a LEGO fan, you'll probably end up taking home more than you planned.\n\nGetting there is easy: from Nagoya Station, you can take a train directly to the park. I recommend arriving early and spending the whole day there, especially if you're visiting with children - they won't want to leave!\n\nAll in all, LEGOLAND Japan is a wonderful theme park filled with imagination and creativity. Whether you're traveling with family, on a date, or just looking to rediscover your inner child, it's absolutely worth a visit. I'll definitely be back again!",

A note that the 4th/5th floors are not 4th/5th floors per se, as they are all the way at the top of the tower and there are no other floors in between.\n\nAlso, only thing is that if you are not familiar with Nagoya's buildings (which I am not), the night view can look quite generic. By the way, if you are going to and fro the tower, I personally find walking from Higashiyamakoen Station easier and more straightforward (see blue route in one of the photos).",

As someone who enjoys both history and leisure, I found the transformation of this former factory into a beautifully landscaped shopping mall to be truly fascinating.\n\nThe grounds are lovely, with well-maintained gardens that make for a peaceful stroll. You can still see traces of its industrial past, which adds a unique character to the site. There are several interesting exhibits about the history of Noritake ceramics, allowing visitors to learn about the craftsmanship and legacy of this famous brand. The historical displays are both educational and visually appealing.",

The museum was a real highlight for me-it's packed with gorgeous Noritake porcelain pieces that showcase incredible craftsmanship. It's amazing to see how their designs have evolved over the years.\n\nThe garden itself was so peaceful. I loved walking along the paths, surrounded by greenery and the sound of the fountain. It's the kind of spot where you can take a deep breath and just relax.\n\nClose to Nagoya Station, it's the perfect place for a mix of culture and calm. Highly recommend!",
