I also saw a huge pufferfish.\n\nParking isn't free, but it's organized, and you can also rent a table, chairs, and an umbrella at a reasonable price. I rented a life vest from a friendly guy in the parking lot - he also shared some great tips about other beaches around the island, which was super helpful.\n\nThere are snacks available right by the beach, including Okinawa soba. We tried the hot dogs, and they were surprisingly good and affordable. Overall, a relaxing place with a unique wildlife experience.

It's worth visiting as you can enjoy schools of beautiful fish in tranquil bay. Many snorkeling tours start from this beach. My 5yo and 4yo enjoyed snorkeling here too. You might be able to see sea turtles too (according to the hotel concierge there are 3 to 4 turtles around in the bay) .\nYou can rent snorkel gears at the beach house. Otherwise make sure to bring your own snorkel and safety systems including life jacket and reef shoes.\nBe aware of the tide conditions and timings, when I visit there in July I was told by the hotel concierge that you need to snorkel in the morning not the afternoon.\nConveniently located for those who stay at the Shigira Beach Resort.
