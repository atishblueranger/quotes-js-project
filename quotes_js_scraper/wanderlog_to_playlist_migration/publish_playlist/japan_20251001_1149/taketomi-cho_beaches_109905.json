I went there a couple of weeks ago and it was absolutely beautiful.\n\nI'm from a warm and humid climate, but this place still put me to the test, as I went in early June, which is part of the rainy season, so the humidity can be quite wild (and UV apparently, too, which I found out after getting burned). I'd recommend sunscreen even if it might rain that day and no less than a few bottles of electrolyte water.\n\nI chose to circumnavigate most of the island on foot (I'm crazy for this), but most people rent bikes here. I recommend picking the bike unless you're ready to walk for miles. Either way, it was a beautiful walk, and there's a few cool little sites you can stop by on the island as you wish.\n\nThis is not a very touristy island IMHO. Even the local tourist advertisement stuff from my hotel on Ishigaki Island barely mentioned this island. It's mostly farming and quiet beaches. It's a 1.5 hour ferry to here, or a 1 hour version for the faster boat that may get very bumpy like it did for me.\n\nThis was one of my favorite rural experiences in Japan. When the local music came on at noon, I thought that was cool.\n\nExpect to see lots of crows, goats, and butterflies on this island. There were literally hundreds of butterflies flying around me when I walked on some unnamed roads in the southeast part of the island. In the north, there is a territorial crow about 100m-200m south of the ferry port on the main road (guesstimate), so be careful of that one. The goats were curious and nice. A kind local farmer showed me where a turtle was hiding too.\n\nThere's also mangrove areas and beaches. The southernmost vending machine was cool too! And I was able to spot Nakamigami island from the northwest corner of Hateruma. (I thought it was Yonaguni at first)\n\nThis was one of the most memorable walks I have done in Japan.\n\nAttached photo: view of Iriomote island from northern Hateruma.",

The beach is super shallow at certain time to the point it does not suit for swimming at all.
