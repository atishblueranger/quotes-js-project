Local people say this is a place you need to see in all four seasons, and I’m happy to have experienced what seems to be the rarest (winter) during my most recent trip. My favorite part about this most beautiful of Kanazawa things to do is how diverse it is horticulturally, from the twisty pines that line the shores of Kasumigaike Pond, to a lush  ume plum grove that boasts bursts of bright pink in winter.",

In the evening, only a few restaurants are open for dinner and they close quite early at around 7-8pm.\nThere is a good variety of fresh seafood ranging from oysters to snow crabs, uni, sashimi and abalone. On average a bit pricey but worth it for the quality and freshness.\nHighly recommend checking out the restaurants at the first floor only. We tried the restaurants on level 2 but they are way more expensive and simply do not provide the variety of seafood that the restaurants on level 1 offer.",

The carvings, silk screen doors, courtyard, and gardens give a glimpse as to the decor. The structure is deceiving and larger than appears. The gardens tranquil with 3 large koi drifting casually in pond. Other houses have beautiful entries. It's clearly now an upmarket area in which to live. The alleyways offer the idea with narrow lanes walled on either side. It's not a large area but easy to pass 2-3 hours. Shopping runs parallel to area.

Very centrally located next to the train station that you can walk even when it's raining. The food is the best and they offered two locations for two nights. They have a public bath that's not onsen but still help us to relax. Room on the small side I think. Service is very accomodative which is what I love.\n\nTop rating!",
