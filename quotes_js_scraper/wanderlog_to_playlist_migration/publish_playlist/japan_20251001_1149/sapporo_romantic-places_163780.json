Honestly, the free tour is pretty short - it's mainly about the history of how Sapporo Beer was founded, along with a small exhibit showing what the brewery looked like in the past. You can finish the tour in about 10–15 minutes, depending on how much time you spend reading the panels.\nThe highlight was definitely the beer tasting afterward. Theres a queue to purchase the ticket but it's quite fast like 5-10mins. We tried three different beers for around 1200 yen because we were curious about the different flavors. Our favorite was the “Black Label” - super smooth and easy to drink. The “Classic” had a slightly bitter aftertaste, which wasn't really to our liking. As for the “Kaitakushi,” we'd rank it last - it was quite bitter, especially at the end, so it might appeal more to those who like stronger, more bitter beers.\nThere are seating areas for tasting, but they can get crowded, so we ended up standing at a table in the back, which was perfectly fine.\nRight next to the museum, there's a large shopping mall with stores like Uniqlo, GU, and more - definitely worth stopping by for a quick browse!",

Tour is well laid out, and flows from start to finish. There is a beer tasting hall at the end with an exclusive Sapporo Beer Museum brew only available at this location and not sold anywhere else.\n\nShop is also available for souvenirs.

To get to the top, head to the cable car entrance, buy your ticket, and take the first cable car followed by another small train-like lift. The whole journey doesn't take too long, and the view at the top is absolutely worth it. It gets quite chilly up there, even in summer, so bring an extra layer. There's also a restaurant at the summit, but you'll need to book several weeks in advance. Just be prepared for a bit of a queue when heading back down after sunset. Would definitely recommend it.",

By the time we got to the top it was dark (beautiful view) but also very cold. The line to get back down went up 2-3 stairways and outside in the freezing cold. Probably around a 2-3 hour wait. We panicked. We finally figured there was a road to the middle larger lift so walked down the stairs to two small glass exit doors and went out. Used our phone flashlights to take us down a beautiful path to the middle level. Saved the day, but the people there said there was no way to walk down. Wrong!

Moiwa Ropeway is where it's at.\n\nThe ride up is smooth, scenic, and quick. First, you hop on a ropeway that glides over lush green hills, and then transfer to a cute little mini cable car that brings you right to the summit. At the top? A 360° panoramic view of Sapporo, the mountains, and on clear days, even the sea. It's a whole vibe-especially as the sun starts to dip and the lights of the city flicker on.\n\nThere's a café and a small observation deck (which can get crowded at golden hour), but honestly, the view does all the heavy lifting. There's even a “lovers' bell” and lock wall if you're feeling romantic-or just want an excuse to ring a bell and make a wish.\n\n💡 Pro tip: Time it right-arrive about 45–60 minutes before sunset to beat the crowds and snag the best spot. And bring a jacket. Even in summer, that mountain breeze means business.",

The restaurant was small and cozy.\nThere were quite a lot of customers when I went there at 7.30am.\nThere were several seafood bowl shops and restaurants, and prices were moderate. The prices were moderate.\nAsparagus and potatoes were also available at\n.\nThe market is close to the downtown area\nso it was good to be able to use the market easily.",

The taste was delicious, but the price was quite high. I think the strawberries bought in the food zone on the lower floor of Daimaru are tastier and cheaper.",

Stalls were lined with beautiful displays of crabs, scallops, sea urchins, and more-it was a feast for the senses even before tasting anything.\n\nAfter browsing around, we decided to sit down for lunch at one of the small stalls inside the market. We ordered fresh kaisendon and grilled seafood-everything was incredibly fresh and flavorful. The seafood bowl was overflowing with tuna, salmon roe, sweet shrimp, and uni, and it was easily one of the best meals we had during our Hokkaido trip. The staff at the stall were warm and welcoming, even helping us with recommendations.\n\nThe kids also enjoyed walking around afterward, checking out other stalls and watching the seafood being cleaned and grilled on the spot. There's a very local, down-to-earth feel about the whole place, which made the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nNijo Market is more than just a place to buy seafood-it's a window into Hokkaido's food culture and a great spot for a satisfying, authentic lunch in Sapporo.",
