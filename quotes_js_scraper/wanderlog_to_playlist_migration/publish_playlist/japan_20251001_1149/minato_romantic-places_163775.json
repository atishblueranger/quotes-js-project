The observation decks provide clear, panoramic views of the city, and on a good day, you can see Mount Fuji in the distance. While the tower itself is a well-known landmark, the visit inside is calm and organized. The different levels offer good photo opportunities of the surrounding area. It's a solid choice for anyone looking to see the city from above without the feeling of being rushed.",

            "text": "I had been looking forward to visiting Tokyo Tower, especially at night, having seen so many beautiful photos of the city lights stretching endlessly into the horizon. Seeing it in person absolutely lived up to expectations. The view from the Main Deck at 150 metres was stunning, with a full panoramic scene of Tokyo's sparkling skyline. I stayed up there for around 40 minutes taking in the sights and snapping photos from multiple angles.\n\nTokyo Tower stands at 333 metres tall and was inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, though it's slightly taller. Built in 1958, it originally served as a television broadcasting antenna and remains one of the city's iconic landmarks. Its red-and-white design stands out beautifully, especially when lit up at night.\n\nThe atmosphere on the observation deck was relaxed, and there was plenty of room to enjoy the views without feeling crowded. The night lighting changes seasonally, which adds something a little different if you visit at various times of year. You can also explore souvenir shops, grab a drink, or check out the FootTown building underneath with its mini attractions and eateries.\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Tokyo, I'd definitely recommend adding this to your evening plans. It's especially ideal for photographers and anyone wanting a breathtaking, elevated view of the city.",

Other than observation decks, there are multiple gift shops, restaurants and gallery at this location. We bought our tickets online few days in advance to reserve the date and time. Upon arrival we checked-in at the counter. Guests need to arrive during their ticket slots or they might not allow them to get in at another time.\n\nThe walkway to the elevator was a nice historical gallery of how the tower was made. Then the elevator took us to the first observation deck where we were greeted with juices and alcohol drinks. Here we also took a souvenir photo that was included with the ticket. We hopped on another elevator that took us the higher observation deck. It had some really nice 360 view of Tokyo. Because of the haze, the skyline was not so clear. We spent about 15 minutes here, since there wasn't much to see other than the city skyline.\n\nThen we head back to the lower deck that had gift shop, glass see thru floor and larger windows with city view. Here we spent about another 20 minutes. The gift shop had excellent items. I got a small replica of the tower and few other stuff from the shop.\n\nFinally we head down the main entrance where we explored the bigger gift shop. It had way more items like tower coin chocolates, bakery items and an ice cream shop. There was also a gallery and restrooms.  Overall we had a wonderful time here. Enjoyed the sight and the shopping. It's very clean and maintained. Absolutely recommend for anyone visiting Tokyo.",

It's also spacious, making it a great spot for running or jogging. While it's especially popular during cherry blossom season, the park is just as enjoyable in the summer, with its wide greenery and relaxing atmosphere.\n\nThat said, I don't really enjoy the presence of a few loiterers in certain areas, which can make the park feel a bit less comfortable at times. Still, overall it remains a pleasant place to spend time, whether for a walk, some light exercise, or simply to sit and enjoy the surroundings.",

After a quick and easy train ride, we arrived and had dinner in the surrounding complex before heading toward the ticket counter. Unfortunately, we arrived just a few minutes before closing and missed the last admission time, so we weren't able to go up the tower that night.\n\nEven though we didn't make it to the top, the visit still turned out to be worthwhile. The tower itself is massive and really impressive, especially at night. It was fully illuminated and the colours changed periodically, cycling through purples, blues, reds, and a stunning rainbow display at one point. I was able to get several photos from different angles on our walk up to the tower, and it still felt like a great experience even without going to the top.\n\nThe whole area around the base is clean, modern, and easy to navigate, with shopping, restaurants, and a very open plaza for photos. I'll definitely come back earlier next time to enjoy the observation deck and views over Tokyo, but even just seeing the tower up close was worth the visit.",

It's really impressive!\n\nThe location is very convenient, with many train lines nearby, so it's easy to get there from anywhere in the city.\n\nOn the lower floors, there are lots of shops and restaurants.

Despite this I found this shrine and its bridges amazing.  Able to walk around space and would love to see this with wisteria either in bloom or just filled out with leaves.  Neighborhood is packed with restaurants and cool shops.  Even saw one small bloom that I'm pretty sure was a plum blossom. No wait to walk around but I expect at least 90 minutes if getting or returning a bull finch figure.",

The bullfinch charms and wisteria themed charms and ema are very pretty. It's very striking seeing the Skytree in the distance contrasting with the shrine grounds.  Unfortunately the main shrine was under maintenance when I visited,  but that gives me a reason to visit again sometime!

The air was noticeably fresh and clean, adding to the overall sense of calm. I highly recommend trying the boating experience here-it was both relaxing and fun, offering a unique way to take in the natural beauty of the park.

We planned to come here a week before, but it was raining for days. Good thing we waited for that beautiful, sunny day.\n\nDefinitely coming back here in the future.\n\nTips:\n- The best route is from the exit of Kudanshita Station.\n- There are approximately 1,000 sakura trees. According to their billboard, you can donate to the park if you want to help protect these poor trees from the effects of climate change.\n- According to the signs, you can't use tripod.\n- The line for the boat is already long when we passed by at 8am. They start operations at 9am.\n- Night lights turn on from sunset to 10pm.",
