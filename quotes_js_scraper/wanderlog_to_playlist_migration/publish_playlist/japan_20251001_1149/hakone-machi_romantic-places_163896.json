Said to bring luck in battle, its powers have been trusted by the likes of shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu and 12th-century ruler Minamoto no Yoritomo. For a double dose of spiritual clout, continue your walk for another ten minutes to Kuzuryu Shrine, which draws on the legend of a nine-headed dragon that managed to calm a poisonous monster that terrorised Lake Ashi way back in the Nara period (710-794).",

I loved how the tall trees towered over our heads and the way the green of the forest mixed with the redish orange colors of the shrine. The architecture was simply stunning. And of course the torii gate on the lake is the main celebrity here. Just know that there's a crazy long line to get a picture with it at all times, some saying it was an hour of waiting. We didn't wait, we decided to admire the main part of the shrine instead.  Don't forget to get some water from the shrine spring, it's said to bring good luck.",

The iconic red torii gate, emerging from the lake like a spiritual submarine hatch, is Instagram bait but somehow still sacred.\n\nFounded in 757 AD, back when Fuji was still updating her firmware, the shrine once drew samurai warriors seeking divine WiFi before battle. These days, it draws influencers in linen shirts whispering “so zen” before posting a Reel with lofi beats.\n\nThe walk up through ancient trees is calming except when the fog gets too thick and you start questioning your life choices and the location of your travel group. Bonus: there's also a side shrine for a nineheaded dragon deity. Because oneheaded dragons are just too basic for Hakone. 1200 years of vibes and foggy drama, blessed.\n\n📸 Tip: Come early morning for mist, mystery, and minimal humans. Otherwise, enjoy the queue to touch a gate.",

The Picasso exhibition is very nice, mostly the second floor with his bullfighting pieces. I felt like you can experience a lot of Japan's unique nature in one place, they have a little foot bath with hot water to experience the “onsen”, a small but charming bamboo forest, you can see the mountains, it is totally worth it. My kids had a lot of fun and enjoyed the play area and interactive spaces",

I think it kept people away, which means it was fairly quiet, even on autumn Sunday. They are also very strict about not bringing in phones or other camera devices, all the way to having a metal detector. There's lots of lockers at the entrance.

The flowers are medium sized (about 2.5 cm in diameter) and have a faint crimson tint. Plum blossoms with a faint crimson color like this give a sense of profundity and fragility. The tips of the petals are lightly wavy, the stamens are yellowish, and the bottom of the flower is yellowish brown. Is the name derived from the song \"Kayoi Komachi\"? When I look at the flower again with this in mind, it seems to be filled with an ethereal atmosphere.\n\n24 May, 2023 :\n\nLovely roses are in full bloom, dazzling in contrast with the fresh greenery. It is the best time to see them!\nAlso, don't miss the tuberous fruits on each of the plum trees.\nMoreover, if you sit still for a while along the creek, you will be able to enjoy Orthetrum albistylum speciosum(Shioka Tombo), Cercion hieroglyphicum(Ito Tombo) and Butterflies.\nAnother must-see is Hydrangea(Ajisai), although there are only a few plants, which seem to be eagerly waiting for their season to arrive.\nFurthermore, in the early morning, Irises and Lotus flowers are also blooming beautifully.",

It looks sturdy and cold but you will see the concierge guys coming to you with a warm welcoming smile to greet you and help you with yr luggages! Such a perfect welcome! When you enter into the modern style hotel, you will be impressed by the interior design and gently greeted by the check in staff. We were very blessed to be upgraded to a junior suite. This being our final hotel stay before flying home, we were absolutely awed by this treat from HH! Thank you indeed from the bottom of our hearts!\nWe loved the view of the lake from our room with a balcony. The beds n pillows are too comfortable & there were plenty of amenities. Very generous. It's the first for us to be told to switch onsens at different time of the day so that both genders can experience the different features of each onsen. Very good idea! 👍 But I personally find these onsens a tat too hot for my relaxation. I think 2-3 C degrees lower will be ideal.\nThe breakfast buffet was just excellent tho we wondered what happened to Japanese since we are in Japan 🤭. Around the HH there's plenty to do- Pirate ship cruise down Lake Ashi, Togendai ropeway, hiking on either sides of HH around the lake, walking the skywalk suspension bridge etc… a perfect location. Thanks Hakone Hotel staff for this unforgettable experience! You will be highly recommended!",

It's also one of my last nights in Japan so it's a shame I ate here.\n\nThe place itself is cool. This is the only place I didn't like the food in Japan.\n\nHonestly would not recommend, the food quality is cheat Chinese all you can eat in the USA type of vibe. Even the sashimi was bad.
