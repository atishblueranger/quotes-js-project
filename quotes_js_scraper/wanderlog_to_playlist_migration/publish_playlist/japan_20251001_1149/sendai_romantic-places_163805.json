The tataki was also outstanding, with a delicate texture and deep umami taste. To complete the meal, we added tororo to the rice, which made everything even more satisfying.\n\nIf you love gyutan, this is a must-visit spot. Highly recommended!",

We paid 500 yen per person.\n\nThe good thing is that there are free parking spots very close to the entrance and it is enough to show them the tickets you bought when coming back.\n\nI would say that if you have an hour to space in Sentai this one might be a good alternative to consider.",

It is the building complex of the burial chamber of Date Masamune, feudal lord and founder of modern Sendai city, and his heirs.\n\nThe building complex is rich colorful splendid in design and elegantly painted, while outside roads to the Zuihoden are surrounded by tall trees and quasi forest.\n\nIt seems that Zuihoden is more attractive, especially for foreign visitors, for area outside the worship hall, such as forest-style roads which have stylish beauty.  On the contrary, the worship hall and grave inside is rather contemporary rebuilt with historical importance and meaning perhaps for local residents, but it may be a stranger historical anecdote which is less attractive for foreign visitors or even out-of-town Japanese visitors for remote association of the local lord. This reflection and comment are based on observation that fewer visitors took photos in front of Zuihoden worship hall and nearby building, while most visitors did have photo taking at forest-style roads.\n\nCompared to other tour attractions in Sendai, Zuihoden probably has the best bilingual explanation postings at its site, and it does help foreign visitors for viewing.\n\nThe entrance ticket for Zuihoden is $570 Yen, although it can be reduced to $460 Yen for Sendai Loople ticket holder.",

It links Sendai City Center to Sendai Airport and other major tour attractions, such as Matsushima Island, and other cities with bullet trains.\n\nThere is a tourist information office, located inside with JR ticketing customer office.\n\nWhile Sendai Station is very clean and well maintenance, it is very crowded at space near certain specific exits, probably because locals, friends, etc., like to use Sendai Station as gathering points for parties, dinner, shopping and other activities. Thus, when Sendai has hotter weather, Sendai Station can be even more crowded with young people waiting at near Exits.\n\nFor people who stop over Sendai Station in early August, they may get the chance to enjoy the view of Sendai Tanabata [Starlight] Festival, with Tanabata Decoration [Streamer] displays. Compared to more colorful and more exaggerated styles of Tanabata decorations at other sites, such as Chuo-dori and Ichibancho-dori in the Sendai city center, Tanabata decorations at Sendai Station are relatively compact, shorter and thinner, less exaggerated.  But they probably serve as the first shock of experiencing Tanabata decorations for the tourists who stop over Sendai, either they visit Sendai by JR bullet trains or by airplanes and transfer to Sendai by train again.\n\nThere are gift shops, restaurants, bakeries, etc. at the 1st and 2nd floors of the Sendai Station, and almost every exit will lead visitors to different dining quarter or shopping mall's food courts.",

            "text": "The Sendai Tanabata Festival, annually celebrated on August 6th, 7th and 8th, is a personal and family favorite from throughout the years.  From my childhood to youth, the Kroehler family traveled to our summer cottage on the Shichigahama shoreline in Miyagi Prefecture, just due east, outside of the Sendai metropolitan area.  As a family, we often drove into Sendai (or took the train from Tagajo Station) in order to attend the festival.  The iconic, mesmerizing very colorful streamers annually invited (welcomed) large local crowds and visitors from around the world.\n\nI knew the general love-story, which underpinned this remarkable annual celebration.  There were reasons for the countless ferverent prayers and pleas for good weather throughout the night on August 7th.  But, not until now, have I carefully researched the underlying background to this very popular Japanese celebration with deep historical Chinese roots and legacy.  Here then, is my first attempt, to describe the important highlights of this popular star-studded ancient Chinese poem.\n\nThe Tanabata Festival in Sendai, based upon an ancient Chinese love-story, now widespread throughout Japan, is celebrated (according to the Chinese calendar) each year over the three days of August 6th, 7th and 8th.  Others in Japan attend Tanabata events on July 7th.  This romance is a bitter-sweet, hopeful account of an fleeting-moment rendevous under ideal, good weather circumatances. Visitor from throughout Japan and around the world, press into the arcade to view these spectacular, lively streamers. They gracefully hang from high arcade arches above (and, perhaps, some would say reach into the heavens). Individuals of all ages stand below their beautiful stunningly individually crafted, very special, colorful unforgettable forms.  But, the underlying amazing and captivating ancient Chinese poem is equally remarkable as well as awe inspiring.\n\nI wanted to carefully investigate the history of this awe-inspiring legend, which I have have heard throughout my childhood, youth and now into my adult life.  What I found, deeply impressed me.  The contours of this very popular legendary account, kept it's basic highlights and storyline.  But, the specific details of the fairy- tale poem varied substantially.  Also, I wanted to devine Asian attitudes toward the magpies, which play a critical, all-important role in this narrative.  I came across remarkable findings about East Asian Chinese, Korean, and Japanese views about this very special, lucky bird.  These results follow in my narrative.  May you, my reader, become infatuated, and yes fully, hopelessly immersed in the story / poem details, storyline and final joyful outcome.\n\nMy research reveals these facts.  This love story, from records, goes back 2,600 years ago to the Chinese Han dynasty dated (202B.C.-220A.D.) in one account (206B.C.-220A.D.) in another.  Later, the storyline evolved in \"Classic of Poetry,\" more than 2,500 years ago, a Tang Dynasty (618-907A.D.) Era poem, called the \"Tian He\" or \"The Heavenly River.\" And, still later during the Song Dynasty (960-1279), the Que Qiao Xia or \"Immortals At The Magpie Bridge\" added further details.  The storyline evolved.\n\nIn time, Sendai embraced the Tanabata Star Festival under Sendai Daimyo (Warlord) Date Masamune (1567-1636).  Sendaians celebrate this festival according to the Chinese lunar calendar on August 7th (including 6th and 8th), other regions across Japan observe Tanabata on July 7th, under the modern Roman calendar.\n\nTruly, in this context, folk-tales and poems too can offer forward-looking benefits regarding pride of hard work, persistence and a sincere eternal hope in future possibilities and good fortune.  HINT:  How many different types of values can YOU identify, which underpin this remarkable story?  I count at least seven (a lucky number). And, YOU?\n\nPlease carefully study my images and accompanying commentary.  So YOU too, my reader, can star-gaze, dream and envision your own optimistic future. What wonderful future opportunities await you on the horizon?",

            "text": "(Translated by Google) One of Tohoku's four major festivals, the Sendai Tanabata Festival is a magnificent traditional festival that dates back to the time of Date Masamune. Gorgeous Tanabata decorations adorn the streets, seven kinds of wish sticks with various wishes draw attention, and a variety of events are held to entertain the public.\n\nSendai City in Miyagi Prefecture, the largest city in the Tohoku region and known as the \"Mori no Toku\" (Mori-no-Mori), hosts the Sendai Tanabata Festival for three days each year from August 6th to 8th. This spectacular festival attracts approximately two million tourists, and not only downtown Sendai and its surrounding shopping districts, but also throughout the city itself, is adorned with magnificent Tanabata decorations.\n\nTanabata originates from Chinese legend, narrating the annual meeting of the stars Altair and Vega across the Milky Way. The practice of \"Qiqiaodian,\" which encourages people to emulate the skilled weaver girl and improve their craftsmanship, is said to have been introduced to Japan during the Nara period.\n\nThe most compelling theory regarding the origins of the Sendai Tanabata Festival is that it was popularized as an annual festival by Date Masamune (1567-1636), the founder of the Sendai clan.\n\nThe festival's Tanabata decorations include the \"Seven Decorations.\" Traditionally, Japanese people write wishes on long strips of paper called \"tansho\" (prayers) and then hang them on bamboo branches as decorations.\n\nThe Sendai Tanabata Festival features seven decorations: \"tansho\" (prayers), which pray for academic advancement and calligraphy; \"kinsho\" (wealth and savings); \"kinsho\" (drawstring bags for coins and small items); \"shirō\" (cleanliness and thriftiness); \"casting nets\" (a bountiful catch); \"paper cranes\" (safety and longevity for the family); \"wind banners\" (improvement in weaving techniques); and \"paper clothes\" (improvement in tailoring skills and protection from misfortune).\nA distinctive feature of the festival is the three-dimensional sphere, resembling a \"kaedo,\" atop each of the seven decorations. As these Tanabata decorations reach nearly five meters in length, the spectacle is truly breathtaking. The traditional wind streamers, made of Japanese paper, rustle in the wind, bringing a refreshing coolness to the sweltering summer heat.\nWalking along the beautiful streets, one can almost feel the joyful atmosphere of the time, and the overwhelming emotion lingers deeply in one's heart, leaving behind everlasting memories.\n\n(Original)\n東北四大祭典「仙台七夕祭」：始於伊達政宗時代的華麗絢爛的傳統祭典。華麗絢爛的七夕裝飾點綴整條街道・寫上各種願望的「七種祈願籤裝飾」引人矚目・同時舉辦各式多彩的活動，讓人樂在其中。\n以「杜之都」之名為人所知的東北地方最大都市・宮城縣仙台市，每年8月6～8日會舉辦為期3天的「仙台七夕祭」。吸引約莫200萬人的觀光客前來共襄盛舉的一大祭典，除了仙台的市中心和周邊商店街，市內各地也都點綴著「七夕裝飾」，美輪美奐。\n\n「七夕」的典故來自中國傳說，牛郎星和織女星每年一次會渡過銀河相見的故事。希望向擅長織布的織女看齊，祈求手藝精進的「乞巧奠」活動，據傳是奈良時代傳到日本的。\n\n關於「仙台七夕祭」的起源，最有力的說法是在仙台藩祖・伊達政宗（1567～1636年）的推廣下，成為年節慶典普及開來。\n\n祭典的七夕裝飾有不可或缺的「七種裝飾」。通常，日本的七夕會在被稱為「短冊」的長條紙上寫下心願－－祈願籤，然後掛在的竹枝上做為裝飾。\n\n仙台七夕祭有祈求學問和書法進步的「短冊」（祈願籤）、「巾著（富貴、儲蓄）」（巾著是指收納零錢或小物的束口袋）、「屑籠（整潔和節儉）」（屑籠指裝紙屑的容器）、「投網（漁獲豐收）」、「紙鶴（闔家平安、長壽）」、「風幡（精進織布技術）」、「紙衣（裁縫技巧精進、消災解厄）」，由這7種裝飾來點綴。\n7種裝飾的最頂端會裝上像「彩球」這樣的立體球型，是一大特色。因為這些七夕裝飾的全長接近5公尺，所以景象頗為壯觀，為之震撼。習慣使用和紙製作的風幡，隨風搖曳，發出沙沙的聲響，為炎熱的夏天帶來一陣涼爽。\n走在美麗的街道上，仿佛可以感受到當時愉悦的氣氣氛，滿滿的感動仍留在心底深處，永遠的回憶。",

You can try the zunda shake, based on edamame (I know it doesn't sound right but, trust me, try it).\nThe \"hike\" to the top is quite physical so it's a nice little challenge.

The previous one was at the Sendai City Museum, and it left a strong impression on me. It was relocated and can now be seen in contrast with the statue at Sendai Castle.\n\n(Original)\n金属供出で撤去された初代で残っていた部分。よく残っていたと思います。前は仙台市博物館にあって強く印象に残っていました。移設され仙台城にある像との対比で一緒に眺められるようになりました。",
