The location we visited was near the entrance of the Higashimuki Shopping Street (東向商店街) near the Kintetsu Nara Train Station (近鉄奈良駅) and just a couple of minutes’ walk from the Nara Prefectural Building. We opted for the 7-piece lunchbox, which comes with two pieces of tai sea bream (鯛), two pieces of sake salmon (さけ), and three pieces of saba mackerel for ¥1,177 after tax (US$10.60).",

The set comes with a most refined dash soup and a cup of tea. And they will provide diners with carriers to takeout any sushi they cannot finish\n\nA most pleasant dining experience here as their staff were all very affable and professional even though we are not conversant in Japanese",

Personally, I found it a bit underwhelming-perhaps because my expectations were high.\n\nFor takeaway, it's important to consume the sushi as soon as possible and keep it at the recommended temperature, as the flavor changes noticeably if not stored properly. I'd recommend grilling or heating it up, following the instructions provided in the packaging.\n\nThe price is slightly higher than other similar stores, likely due to the detailed and thoughtful packaging. However, it's worth trying if you're nearby and curious about this traditional delicacy. There's also a eat-in area within the store.",
