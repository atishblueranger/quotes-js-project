It felt like the quietest place in Tokyo, probably because it was.\n\nI have cycled here hundreds of times, watched the boats, planes and fishermen go by. It's a real treat as the sun goes down over the bay.\n\nIt has a camping area, really good cycle path where the kids and adults can rent bikes and a fishing area with tackle shop.\n\nIf you walk up to the car park, it's worth checking to see if a car club is there. If you like cars you can sometime see some great cars here.\n\nUnfortunately you can't cycle over the bridge, maybe this will change after the other area is redeveloped.",
