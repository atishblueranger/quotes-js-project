            "text": "Mukojima-Hyakkaen Gardens\n\nI had high hopes when visiting this garden on a lovely March day, especially because the brochure explains that the word “Hyakkaen” in its name, means, “garden where hundreds of flowers bloom all four seasons of the year.”  In my experience, Japanese tourist information is remarkably helpful and accurate. In this particular case, however, on this late winter day, I regret to report that that description was hyperbole. It was just too early in the season this year, (I'm writing this in mid March, 2025), and instead of hundreds of blossoms, I saw only one camellia in bloom, a single bush of perhaps 50 flowers. Unfortunately for me, the rest of the garden was still largely in a dormant winter state. Despite this disappointment, it was clear that in the space of a couple of weeks, it will be a spectacular place to visit. I shall have to return, because it is obvious that it will explode with floral color when spring finally hits Tokyo. While I am unable to provide a rapturous account of glorious blossoms, I can say that the garden is quite small and easy to navigate. It is almost entirely flat, with only a few elevated sections that allow you to gain a better view in certain areas. The narrow little stream that runs through it is charming, with little bridges that allow you to easily cross. I can't wait to come back later in the spring when everything is in full bloom. I have no doubt it will be a spectacular place to visit. Unfortunately, in winter, it doesn't live up to its name.",

But my visit here was just before the Covid19 pandemic and according to some Japanese friends there, many of the businesses have shuttered down. I feel sad for them. One of them is Naritaya, a Halal Japanese Restaurant, serving Muslims from Malaysia and around the world.\n\nOverall, there are quite a few interesting shops to discover in this street, one of them being a Ninja Shop! Or a traditional Japanese weapons shop, where they sell all kind of Japanese weapons. Others include ice cream, cakes and several small restaurants and clothes shops. Well worth the walk when you visit Senso-ji Temple.\n\nAlso, don't be surprised to see loads of tourists in Kimono and Yukata walking  around. You can actually rent them for the day and go take lots of photos around here.",
