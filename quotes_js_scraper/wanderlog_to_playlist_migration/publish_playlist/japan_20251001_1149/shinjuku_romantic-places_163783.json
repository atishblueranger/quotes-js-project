The path itself feels like a peaceful journey away from the city's noise. Once you reach the shrine, a sense of silence and tranquility takes over. People are respectful, and even tourists naturally adapt to the calm, disciplined atmosphere of the locals. One lovely activity is writing your wish on a wooden plaque and hanging it on the wall beneath the sacred tree. It's a quiet, meaningful moment. Please remember to stay silent and be respectful of those praying at the shrine. You can film and take photos throughout the forest area.. .many beautiful videos come out of this serene place.",

Seeing it in person absolutely lived up to expectations. The view from the Main Deck at 150 metres was stunning, with a full panoramic scene of Tokyo's sparkling skyline. I stayed up there for around 40 minutes taking in the sights and snapping photos from multiple angles.\n\nTokyo Tower stands at 333 metres tall and was inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, though it's slightly taller. Built in 1958, it originally served as a television broadcasting antenna and remains one of the city's iconic landmarks. Its red-and-white design stands out beautifully, especially when lit up at night.\n\nThe atmosphere on the observation deck was relaxed, and there was plenty of room to enjoy the views without feeling crowded. The night lighting changes seasonally, which adds something a little different if you visit at various times of year. You can also explore souvenir shops, grab a drink, or check out the FootTown building underneath with its mini attractions and eateries.\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Tokyo, I'd definitely recommend adding this to your evening plans. It's especially ideal for photographers and anyone wanting a breathtaking, elevated view of the city.",

Other than observation decks, there are multiple gift shops, restaurants and gallery at this location. We bought our tickets online few days in advance to reserve the date and time. Upon arrival we checked-in at the counter. Guests need to arrive during their ticket slots or they might not allow them to get in at another time.\n\nThe walkway to the elevator was a nice historical gallery of how the tower was made. Then the elevator took us to the first observation deck where we were greeted with juices and alcohol drinks. Here we also took a souvenir photo that was included with the ticket. We hopped on another elevator that took us the higher observation deck. It had some really nice 360 view of Tokyo. Because of the haze, the skyline was not so clear. We spent about 15 minutes here, since there wasn't much to see other than the city skyline.\n\nThen we head back to the lower deck that had gift shop, glass see thru floor and larger windows with city view. Here we spent about another 20 minutes. The gift shop had excellent items. I got a small replica of the tower and few other stuff from the shop.\n\nFinally we head down the main entrance where we explored the bigger gift shop. It had way more items like tower coin chocolates, bakery items and an ice cream shop. There was also a gallery and restrooms.  Overall we had a wonderful time here. Enjoyed the sight and the shopping. It's very clean and maintained. Absolutely recommend for anyone visiting Tokyo.",

Though it was a unique and stunning experience, there were really no surprises. Some have said you can easily spend three hours there however I found after an hour I'd had enough. I went at the end of the day so my feet were sore and I was getting tired which didn't help. I have to admit I found the exhibits though visually amazing they lacked meaning. The reason most of the great works of art from the middle ages are religious is because they inspired people on more than just the visual level. Here it was something of an empty, soulless place which unfortunately mirrors the secular society we are living in. This place could have had amazing potential however I found it a little underwhelming. Despite this I would recommend going if you feel it's your thing.",

Despite being near bustling Tokyo Station, the gardens provide a peaceful oasis with large landscaped areas and remnants of Edo Castle's defense structures. In a city where green spaces are limited due to urbanization, these gardens serve as valuable outdoor space for urban residents.",

This hidden gem offers a nostalgic atmosphere, reminiscent of Japan's post-war era, where small bars that can only accommodate a few patrons at a time provide an intimate setting for drinks with friends. While the area has gained popularity among international visitors, it still retains its local charm and may have some establishments with 'Locals Only' signs.",

That said, the experience was still worth it: the building is impressively designed, easy to access, and most importantly, not crowded at all.\n\nA rare find in Tokyo.\n\nInside the observation deck, there's a small souvenir corner, some vending machines, and, for those who like collecting them, four official ink stamps to mark your visit. It's a nice touch for stamp collectors or anyone who enjoys small, meaningful travel mementos.\n\nIf the weather cooperates, it's a must for budget-conscious travelers who still want that “top of Tokyo” moment. But even on a foggy day, the calm atmosphere and lack of tourist chaos make it a worthwhile stop.",
