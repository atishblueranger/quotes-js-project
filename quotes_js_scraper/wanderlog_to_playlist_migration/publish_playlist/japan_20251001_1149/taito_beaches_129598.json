Next to the thousands of furin wind chimes and fantastic lotus flowers that have bloomed; great this summer, I have come in past summers, usually the flowers would seem to have withered in the sun.  Somehow, so many this year great for photography.  The feel of the thousands of wind chimes and sounds gives a one of a kind experience!  Come for the lotus flowers and furin wind chimes and stay for a dusk and sunset meal from the Yatsu stalls, so many foods to sample!  I had a MEGA melon Soda, regular and Chu hi alcohol versions available! Skewers, Long French fried, you name it, they got it.  Only some booths open in the afternoon but as dinner time rolls around it starts getting busy, even on a weekday!",

It's easy to imagine how beautiful it would be during peak bloom, when everything is lush and green.\n\nThat said, even off-season, it's a nice place to walk around, and the views of Bentendo Temple on the little island in the middle of the pond are worth seeing.\n\nIf you're visiting Ueno, it's definitely worth strolling through - especially if you catch it in spring or summer.",

It's also spacious, making it a great spot for running or jogging.

Still, overall it remains a pleasant place to spend time, whether for a walk, some light exercise, or simply to sit and enjoy the surroundings.",
