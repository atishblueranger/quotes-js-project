Walking through the area, you'll find small shrines, ponds, and historical artifacts that offer insight into Samurai culture and the region's history.\n\nThe entrance fee is 1,600 yen for an adult (as of March 2025).

While the limited waiting area seating was a bit of a challenge, and I observed many locals opting to wait in their cars, the eventual reward was worth it.\n\nThe staff's kindness, especially towards foreigners, was truly exceptional. Their patience and attentiveness made the long wait more bearable. Once seated, both the chefs and waitresses were incredibly welcoming, consistently checking on my preferences and ensuring a delightful dining experience.\n\nAnd the sushi? fantastic! The fish was incredibly fresh, and the flavors were simply outstanding. The quality of the ingredients and the chef's skill. But some in menu is so-so.\n\nDespite the extended wait, the overall experience I love is superb service, coupled with the delectable sushi. Just be sure to plan your visit accordingly and be prepared for a potential wait.",

I walked in and was immediately ushered to the counter since I was alone. I grabbed sushi as it went around and asked for wasabi from the chefs. The soup was delicious, the variety of sushi was outstanding. I'll definitely be back next year.",
