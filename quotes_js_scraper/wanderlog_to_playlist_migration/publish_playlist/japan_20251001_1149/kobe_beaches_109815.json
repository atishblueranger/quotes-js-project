What shocked me most was that a security guard came over and told us not to swim. This was September 14, it was 32°C outside, the water was warm, and right nearby lifeguards were training. I asked him why, and he explained that the official swimming season had ended - it was open only until the end of August. The park is covered with thousands of prohibition signs, but not a single one mentioning this. So basically, you're not allowed to swim in perfect conditions just because the calendar says “season's over.” Absolutely ridiculous.",

            "text": "Suma Beach in Kobe is a popular destination for both locals and tourists looking to relax by the sea, especially during the summer months. I recently visited this beach and had a great experience overall, though there are some points to keep in mind before planning a trip.\n\nThe beach is easily accessible, just a short walk from Suma Station on the JR Kobe Line, making it convenient for those traveling from Osaka or Kobe. Upon arrival, I was impressed by the long stretch of sandy shoreline and the beautiful view of the Seto Inland Sea. The water was calm and warm, making it ideal for swimming, though it may not be the clearest compared to beaches in Okinawa or Shikoku.\n\nOne of the highlights of Suma Beach is its lively atmosphere during summer. Beachside restaurants and bars set up temporary stalls, serving delicious seafood, yakitori, and refreshing drinks. Many people were enjoying BBQs, playing beach volleyball, or simply relaxing under umbrellas. The music and entertainment from nearby beach clubs also added to the vibrant energy of the place.\n\nHowever, one downside is that the beach can get quite crowded, especially on weekends. Finding a good spot might be challenging if you arrive late in the day. Additionally, while the beach is generally clean, some areas can have litter left behind by visitors, which slightly takes away from the natural beauty. The city does make efforts to clean the area, but more awareness among visitors would help maintain the beach better.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun and social beach experience close to Kobe, Suma Beach is a great option. It's perfect for a day of swimming, sunbathing, and enjoying the summer vibes. However, if you prefer a quieter, more pristine beach, you might want to explore nearby Awaji Island or other parts of the Seto Inland Sea.",

Apparently during the summer for 6 weeks they mark off a specific area for Smile Beach with strict rule enforcement. If we stayed on the other side of the rope we'd be fine. That's what we were told I think, and saw others there with tattoos.\n\nBut then along the walkway I saw a map a rule sign which said Google translate uses) don't intimidate others, including showing tattoos on the beach. But yet others were there with tattoos on the beach. So I think as long as you avoid the roped off area you should be fine.",
