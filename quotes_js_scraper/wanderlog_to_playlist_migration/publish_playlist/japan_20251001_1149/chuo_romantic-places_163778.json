Seeing it in person absolutely lived up to expectations. The view from the Main Deck at 150 metres was stunning, with a full panoramic scene of Tokyo's sparkling skyline. I stayed up there for around 40 minutes taking in the sights and snapping photos from multiple angles.\n\nTokyo Tower stands at 333 metres tall and was inspired by the Eiffel Tower in Paris, though it's slightly taller. Built in 1958, it originally served as a television broadcasting antenna and remains one of the city's iconic landmarks. Its red-and-white design stands out beautifully, especially when lit up at night.\n\nThe atmosphere on the observation deck was relaxed, and there was plenty of room to enjoy the views without feeling crowded. The night lighting changes seasonally, which adds something a little different if you visit at various times of year. You can also explore souvenir shops, grab a drink, or check out the FootTown building underneath with its mini attractions and eateries.\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Tokyo, I'd definitely recommend adding this to your evening plans. It's especially ideal for photographers and anyone wanting a breathtaking, elevated view of the city.",

Other than observation decks, there are multiple gift shops, restaurants and gallery at this location. We bought our tickets online few days in advance to reserve the date and time. Upon arrival we checked-in at the counter. Guests need to arrive during their ticket slots or they might not allow them to get in at another time.\n\nThe walkway to the elevator was a nice historical gallery of how the tower was made. Then the elevator took us to the first observation deck where we were greeted with juices and alcohol drinks. Here we also took a souvenir photo that was included with the ticket. We hopped on another elevator that took us the higher observation deck. It had some really nice 360 view of Tokyo. Because of the haze, the skyline was not so clear. We spent about 15 minutes here, since there wasn't much to see other than the city skyline.\n\nThen we head back to the lower deck that had gift shop, glass see thru floor and larger windows with city view. Here we spent about another 20 minutes. The gift shop had excellent items. I got a small replica of the tower and few other stuff from the shop.\n\nFinally we head down the main entrance where we explored the bigger gift shop. It had way more items like tower coin chocolates, bakery items and an ice cream shop. There was also a gallery and restrooms.  Overall we had a wonderful time here. Enjoyed the sight and the shopping. It's very clean and maintained. Absolutely recommend for anyone visiting Tokyo.",

After a quick and easy train ride, we arrived and had dinner in the surrounding complex before heading toward the ticket counter. Unfortunately, we arrived just a few minutes before closing and missed the last admission time, so we weren't able to go up the tower that night.\n\nEven though we didn't make it to the top, the visit still turned out to be worthwhile. The tower itself is massive and really impressive, especially at night. It was fully illuminated and the colours changed periodically, cycling through purples, blues, reds, and a stunning rainbow display at one point. I was able to get several photos from different angles on our walk up to the tower, and it still felt like a great experience even without going to the top.\n\nThe whole area around the base is clean, modern, and easy to navigate, with shopping, restaurants, and a very open plaza for photos. I'll definitely come back earlier next time to enjoy the observation deck and views over Tokyo, but even just seeing the tower up close was worth the visit.",

It's a perfect example of controlled chaos - thousands of people moving through the space, yet everything is clean, organized, and remarkably efficient. I was honestly overwhelmed at first, but once I took a breath and followed the signs, it all started to make sense.\n\nThe amount of food available inside is almost ridiculous (in the best way). PLENTY of options, which is on I believe the East? side of the station. Along with a row of giftshops, I forgot what they called it, but you can't miss it.\n\nFrom quick snacks to full meals, you could easily get lost in the station's many underground food halls and still not try everything. There's a lot to explore, so arriving early is a smart move, especially if you're unfamiliar with the layout. It gives you time to find your platform, maybe grab a bite, and even store your bags.\n\nSpeaking of which, the locker system is amazing - easy to use and super convenient if you're carrying luggage or shopping bags. I had a Shinkansen to catch, and the reserved seats were a lifesaver. I used a kiosk to print my ticket, which saved time and stress.

Still, overall it remains a pleasant place to spend time, whether for a walk, some light exercise, or simply to sit and enjoy the surroundings.",

Neighborhood is packed with restaurants and cool shops.  Even saw one small bloom that I'm pretty sure was a plum blossom.

But there are also other flowers in bloom, you can watch the koi, ducks and turtles swim in the water,  and enjoy the tranquility of the garden. The bullfinch charms and wisteria themed charms and ema are very pretty. It's very striking seeing the Skytree in the distance contrasting with the shrine grounds.  Unfortunately the main shrine was under maintenance when I visited,  but that gives me a reason to visit again sometime! Kameido in general is very nice area that feels like a 'town' and was a nice break from central Asakusa",
