Why do they make it a spot when there is no place to stand here. Just a bunch of people doing business and looting people in the name of a spot. Nainital tourism did great to highlight useless places as a spot otherwise there is nothing here apart from the lake. The view was great from here though but the whole Nainital was not a great place for tourists, not well maintained spots, steep curves, locals drive rashly. Many chances  for an accident. And why are people taking their kids with them, It's a crowded place not safe for children and someone who could not walk more than 10kms a day. I'll not visit again. Bye",

You can reach here by the ropeway from Mallital or by road - both are enjoyable, but the cable car ride is definitely more exciting and scenic.\n\nOnce you reach the top, the view is just incredible - peaceful, panoramic, and perfect for clicking pictures. There are also a few small shops, snacks, and a temple up there, making it a pleasant place to spend some time.\n\nHighly recommended for couples, families, and solo travelers.

It's not overcrowded, not too commercial, and offers a panoramic view of Nainital town, the lake, and the Himalayan range-especially on a clear day.\n\nThis spot truly feels like a hidden picnic patch carved out by nature, meant for those who enjoy peace, panoramic views, and a little bit of effort.\n\n🧭 How to Reach / Transportation:\n\nOption 1: Trekking (most popular & rewarding)\n\n!Ticket price is 50 rupees per head by walking\n!Ticket price with horse ride 100rupees per head\n\nStarting Point: Ayarpatta / Sherwood College area\n\nDistance: ~4 km uphill from Mallital (one way)\n\nTime Required: 40 to 90 minutes depending on fitness level and weather\n\nTrail is shaded with trees, birds chirping, and occasional monkeys (don't carry loose food in hand).\n\nOption 2: Horse Ride\n\nAvailable near Cave Garden or Mallital\n\nCost: ₹600–₹800 (round trip, may vary seasonally)\n\nGreat option for those who can't hike but still want the view\n\nOption 3: By Car (partial)\n\nYou can drive or take a local taxi up to a point, then walk ~15–20 minutes\n\nRoads are narrow and parking is limited\n\n🌄 What You'll See at the Top:\nA beautiful stone bench (Dorothy's Seat) made in memory of an English artist who died in a plane crash.\n\nA large open area surrounded by trees-ideal for a tiffin picnic, reading, or simply sitting in silence.\n\nBreathtaking views of Nainital Lake, forest ridges, and the Kumaon hills.\n\nOn clear mornings, you may even glimpse snow-capped peaks in the distance.\n\n⚠️ Trekking Precautions:\n🥾 Wear proper shoes – trail can be slippery during monsoon.\n\n💧 Carry water – there are no vendors once you're on the trail.\n\n🧥 Bring a light jacket or shawl – weather turns cool quickly, even in summer.\n\n🕒 Start early (before 10 AM) – for best views and to avoid afternoon cloud cover or fog.\n\n🐒 Avoid feeding monkeys – they can get aggressive.\n\n🍃 Why Tiffin Top is Special:\nUnlike commercial viewpoints, this one offers quiet beauty, not chaos. It's ideal for travelers who:\n\nWant a calm place to sit and enjoy nature\n\nLove photography, sketching, or meditation\n\nPrefer nature over noise\n\nTiffin Top is not for the lazy tourist. It's for the nature lover.\nYou won't find stalls, music, or crowd selfies here. You'll find wind through the trees, raw mountain air, a story in every stone, and a view that makes the climb worth it.\n\nGo for the hike. Stay for the peace. Return with calm.",

The surrounding hills, covered in lush greenery, rose majestically from the water's edge, their reflections rippling gently on the lake's surface. The clear blue sky above added to the tranquility of the scene, making it a perfect moment to unwind and connect with nature. The gentle lapping of the water against the boat's hull and the occasional call of a bird were the only sounds that broke the silence, creating a sense of peacefulness that was both calming and rejuvenating.\n\nAs I gazed out at the lake, I noticed the way the sunlight danced across the water, creating a mesmerizing display of light and shadow. The surrounding mountains, with their rugged terrain and verdant forests, seemed to stretch up to the sky, their grandeur a reminder of the natural world's majesty. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming flowers and the earthy smell of the forest floor, adding to the sensory experience.\n\nAs I sat there, I felt my worries and concerns slowly drifting away, like the ripples on the lake's surface. The peacefulness of the surroundings seemed to seep into my soul, calming my mind and soothing my spirit. I felt grateful for this moment of solitude, this chance to disconnect from the world and reconnect with nature.\n\nThe boat gently rocked back and forth, creating a sense of gentle motion that seemed to match the rhythm of my breathing. I closed my eyes, letting the tranquility of the moment wash over me, and felt my senses come alive. The sounds, sights, and smells of the lake all blended together to create a sense of harmony and balance.\n\nIn this moment, I felt a deep connection to the natural world, a sense of oneness with the universe that was both exhilarating and humbling. The beauty of Naini Lake was more than just a visual experience – it was a spiritual one, a reminder of the magic and wonder that lies just beyond our daily lives. As I sat there, surrounded by the majesty of nature, I felt my spirit lift, my heart fill with joy, and my soul rejuvenate.",

Once there, he & Bhagwati didi made us feel comfortable and at home.\n\nGanesh bhaiya regaled us with stories about Nainital while Bhagwati didi was always there, with a smile, to serve us whatever we wanted.\n\nCalling the hospitality ‘inviting' is an understatement. Speaking about food, simple, home-cooked meals tasted wonderful and were made with love.\n\nIf you do not want to step out, you can order food in too. Zomato is available; Ganesh bhaiya can provide a few restaurant numbers too.\n\nComing to the house itself, it is a cottage from the British era. It has been painstakingly maintained. The artifacts, from Corbett's lives, are an absolute delight.\n\nWe had a happy time walking around the house, seeing & appreciating each of the artifacts. Hushstay x Gurney House has a small garden where our dog loved to play.\n\nThe surrounding trees are teeming with birds. The location is winning too. In spite of being in the heart of Nainital, it felt exclusive & secluded.",

The 360-degree bird's-eye view of Naina Lake from the top, which made the trek truly worthwhile.\n\nAt the summit, we relaxed with a warm cup of tea and Maggie at the sole shop, taking in the tranquility of the surroundings.\n\nA humble request to all fellow trekkers: please refrain from littering, as it's essential to preserve the pristine beauty of the mountains. Let's work together to keep our environment clean.\n\nThis track comes highly recommended for anyone visiting Nainital, offering an unforgettable experience amidst nature's splendor. ♥️ congratulations you are at 8622 feet above the sea level .",

You can rent a scooty and ride up to the point, which takes around 10-15 minutes from Mall Road. Alternatively, you can take a 45-minute hike to the top.\n\nThe trail is well-marked and enjoyable, with scenic views along the way. At the top, you'll find several eating options and shops to explore. We enjoyed a meal at one of the eateries while taking in the stunning views of the snow-covered mountains.\n\nOverall, Snow Point is a fantastic spot to visit, with its picturesque views, convenient amenities, and exciting hiking trail. It's an absolute must-visit when in Nainital! ♥️",
