This modern shopping center is a breath of fresh air, offering a clean and comfortable environment to shop, dine, and relax.\n\nOne of the standout features for me was the impeccable cleanliness of the toilets. It's not always a given in shopping malls, but Aeon Mall Long Biên definitely gets a thumbs up in this department!\n\nPrices were also very reasonable, making it an excellent destination for those on a budget. From affordable fashion to delicious eats, there's something for everyone here.\n\nHowever, I did notice one slight drawback: the ventilation on the third floor seems to be a bit off. The smell of fried meat from the restaurants wafts through the air, which can be overwhelming at times. Not a deal-breaker, but definitely something to be aware of.\n\nAll in all, I'd give Aeon Mall Long Biên 4 out of 5 stars. It's a fantastic shopping destination with plenty to offer, and with a bit of tweaking to the ventilation system, it could easily become a 5-star favorite!",

It's a great place to spend a few hours whether you're looking to shop, dine, or simply relax. The mall is spacious and well-designed, with multiple floors dedicated to different categories, from high-end brands to affordable stores, catering to all types of shoppers.\n\nWhat I really appreciate about Vincom is the variety of dining options. Whether you're in the mood for a quick bite or a sit-down meal, there are plenty of choices available, from local food stalls to international chains. The food court is particularly convenient for a quick meal while shopping, and the quality of food is generally good.\n\nThe mall is also home to a cinema, making it a great destination for a day out. There's a vibrant atmosphere, and it's always buzzing with people, especially on weekends. However, it can get quite crowded during peak hours, which sometimes makes the shopping experience a bit less enjoyable.\n\nOverall, Vincom is a reliable shopping center with everything you need under one roof. It's not overly luxurious, but it's modern, convenient, and definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",
