The grounds begin with a peaceful garden filled with flowers and fruit trees, followed by an area selling religious and gemstone items.\n\nWe entered the main worship hall next (note: shoulders and knees must be covered and shoes removed). Inside stood a serene golden Buddha with a halo, surrounded by ornate pillars and wall murals.\n\nThe bell tower is another highlight. Visitors can write wishes on slips of paper, attach them to the protective film wrapped around the bell, and ring it for good luckyI rang it twice, just in case!\n\nThe most breathtaking part was the giant standing Buddha, surrounded by rows of golden statues across multiple levels.

Additionally, large ugly resorts have gated off and developed a large part of the lakeshore, well other \"hidden\" areas are littered with trash, but if you can look past that fact and try to get closer to the water, I've been told locals will report you.\n\nSo yes, this lake is romantic and scenic, however, it isn't what it seems. It did offer me a nice drive, although you can encircle the entire lake. Over all, this experience was so disappointing for a natural-born lake girl.",

It was fascinating to walk through the home where Emperor Bao Dai and his family once lived, surrounded by pine forests and beautifully manicured gardens.\n\nThe palace is well maintained and still holds much of its original charm. Inside, the rooms are decorated with the original 1930s–1940s furniture and layout, giving a glimpse into the royal lifestyle. You can explore two levels of the residence, including the reception areas, bedrooms, study rooms, and even the old bathroom and kitchen - all kept as they were when in use.\n\nThe rooms are roped off but visible, and many have informative signs or portraits to give historical context. What stood out were the vibrant carpets, mid-century armchairs, and elegant views out to the lush gardens. Outside, the gardens are immaculately landscaped and full of bright flowers, trimmed hedges, and stone walkways - a peaceful place to slow down and take it all in.\n\nSet aside at least 60 to 90 minutes to explore properly. It's not only a palace-it's a time capsule, and definitely worth visiting while in Da Lat.",

I encountered Hun, one of the professional gardeners of the Pagoda with whom we could have a conversation about the Pagoda and its feelings towards his dedication and hard work towards the house of Buddha. You may also cross path with him, and you'll definitely know that it's him. Wearing a traditional hat and rubber gloves, humble and yet the largest smile i got to see from a vietnamese person. Born on the 4th of June 1953, he showed me the way to the other side of the Pagoda where some pictures and videos had been taken. Hope you will go there and get the experience that is unique, profound, and unforgettable.",

After that, we purchased an additional jeep ticket for 120,000 VND per person to ride to the top. Each jeep carries six people, so we had to look around and find other visitors to join us and make a full group of six.\n\nThe Jeep Ride & Stunning View\n\nOnce we got on the jeep, the ride was exciting and bumpy as we made our way up the steep mountain. The fresh air and surrounding greenery made the experience even better. When we reached the top, we were greeted with an incredible panoramic view of Da Lat-perfect for taking photos!\n\nImportant Things to Remember\n\nMake sure to check your jeep number before getting off so you can find the right vehicle for the return trip.\n\nThe last jeep leaves at 4:55 PM, so don't be late!\n\nAfter enjoying the view and capturing some beautiful moments, we headed back down just in time. Visiting LangBiang was a simple yet fun experience, and we definitely recommend it if you love nature and scenic views!",

Roughly half way up the mountain you will pass a small checkpoint, where i was asked by an old man to show my ticket and write down my name and phone number. From there its around 1 hour more to the peak. The hike takes around 3.5 to 4 hours and is somewhat challenging, specially the last part is kinda steep and was slippery, as it had rained the day before. You can check the hike in all trails app for navigation. Make sure you find the right entry to the trail (outside the entrange gate on the right side there is a arch gate - see photo).  Most of the hike goes through needle tree forest and is a little bit uninspiring. Later it goes through rainy type forest. The view on the peak is nice though. If you are looking for a small challenge or outdoor activity go for it. But if you have other hikes planned on your travel, you can also skip it.",

There's also a 2 hour personal driver but it's an extra 1mil dong to rent.\n\nIt's just about taking pictures and what not.

Inside, you'll find stall after stall stacked with colorful dried fruits, preserved snacks, herbal teas, artichoke products, and local specialties. The chilli mango was a standout and my favorite -sweet, spicy, and addictive. You'll also spot giant jars of freeze-dried strawberries, passionfruit jam, and fruit-infused candies that make perfect souvenirs or snacks for exploring.\n\nOutside, the atmosphere shifts into overdrive as the sun sets. The market square becomes a sea of people, at times we found it hard to move at any pace-locals and tourists alike-enjoying grilled street food like sausages cooked over hot stones, cups of juicy Da Lat strawberries selling for 20,000 VND for a small cup or 40-45,000 VND for a large cup and they were delicious, and other quick bites. There's something thrilling about being among the crowds, especially on the steps overlooking the night market. It feels like the heart of Da Lat pulses here.\n\nFresh produce vendors offer immaculate boxes of strawberries, and the variety and presentation are photo-worthy. Whether you're shopping, tasting, or just soaking in the atmosphere, Da Lat Market is not just a place to visit-it's an experience.\n\nIf you're in Da Lat, set aside a few evenings to come here. It's chaotic in the best way possible and full of delicious discoveries.",
