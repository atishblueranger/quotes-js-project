Perched on a hill overlooking the Perfume River, it's a place where history, spirituality, and stunning architecture all come together.\n\nThe star of the show is, of course, the seven-story pagoda itself. Standing tall and proud, it looks like a guardian watching over the city. As you walk through the entrance with its fierce guardian statues, you can't help but feel a little humbled - and maybe slightly judged for all your past sins (don't worry, they seem forgiving).\n\nInside the grounds, there's so much to see: intricate statues, the ancient bell that's as impressive as it is photogenic, and peaceful gardens perfect for a reflective stroll. The atmosphere is calm, even with visitors around, and it's easy to imagine what life must have been like centuries ago when this was a bustling center of worship.\n\nPro tip:\nWear comfortable shoes - the steps are historic (translation: uneven), and take a moment to just sit quietly and enjoy the breeze by the river. It's also a fantastic spot for photography, so bring your camera or phone fully charged.\n\nOverall, Thien Mu Pagoda is a must-visit while in Hue. Whether you're there for the history, the architecture, or just a bit of soul-soothing calm, you'll leave feeling like you've gained a little perspective… and probably a lot of great photos. 📸",

The lighting setup is really well done-tasteful, modern, and enhances the whole riverside area.\n\nDefinitely worth visiting just before dusk so you can catch the transformation as the lights begin to glow.

There was grass under the trees despite the shade, which made it feel lush and relaxing.\n\nThe grounds were so enjoyable to wander around and so well kept, you can imagine what a fine place this was for an emperor, just beautiful.

It's a beautifully laid-out complex with lots of open space to walk around, relax, and take in the views.\n\nThe area is well maintained and shows great care in its restoration efforts. Everything from the stone paths to the wooden pavilions feels thoughtfully preserved. The large lake in the center reflects the buildings and trees beautifully, adding to the tranquil atmosphere.\n\nWe spent about 45 minutes here, but you could easily stay longer if you enjoy photography or just want to soak up the peaceful surroundings. It wasn't too crowded when we went, which made it even more enjoyable.\n\nHighly recommend this one if you're visiting Hue-especially if you're only picking one or two mausoleums to explore. It combines natural beauty, history, and serenity all in one place.\n\nTuesday\t     7 am–5:30 pm\nWednesday.    7 am–5:30 pm\nThursday\t     7 am–5:30 pm\nFriday\t            7 am–5:30 pm\nSaturday\t     7 am–5:30 pm\nSunday\t            7 am–5:30 pm\nMonday\t     7 am–5:30 pm",

Nestled in the heart of the ancient imperial city, this pagoda is not only a place of worship but also a cultural and historical landmark that reflects the deep roots of Vietnamese Buddhism.\n\nWhat makes Từ Đàm Pagoda especially meaningful to me is the legacy of one of its most revered monks: Venerable Thích Trí Quang. I have long admired him for his intellect, his dedication to Buddhism, and especially his work translating and interpreting many important Buddhist texts into Vietnamese. His influence on Vietnamese Buddhism, both in spiritual and cultural terms, is profound. Though he has passed away, his spirit and teachings are very much alive in this sacred space. It was incredibly moving to walk through the grounds and know that this was a place he once walked, taught, and meditated.\n\nThe pagoda itself is beautiful - quiet, clean, and filled with the scent of incense. The architecture is traditional yet timeless, with a large main hall, well-tended gardens, and statues that inspire a deep sense of calm and reverence. The monks and caretakers are kind and respectful, and there is a genuine atmosphere of compassion and wisdom here.\n\nIf you are in Huế and seeking a meaningful spiritual experience - or simply want a quiet space to reflect - I highly recommend visiting Từ Đàm Pagoda. For me, it was more than a visit; it was a moment of connection with history, faith, and the legacy of a great teacher.",

Its tile-roofed architecture and ornate dragon motifs make it a great example of traditional Vietnamese design. It's a peaceful spot to admire the craftsmanship and relax by the water.\n\nThat said, the surrounding village area felt quite deserted and underdeveloped. There are hints that it once had more tourist potential, but today it's very quiet and feels somewhat forgotten. Still, if you're looking to explore something different outside of Hue city, it's worth a short visit.\n\nWe walked the 4.5km from Hue, which made for a decent workout under the sun! While the walk is long and the attraction is relatively small, it's a pleasant side trip-especially if you enjoy historical architecture or scenic photography.\n\nTip: There are some lovely photo angles from across the canal and under the trees. If you're already in Hue and have time to spare, it's a nice detour.",

Aside from being very clean and having all the necessary amenities, the rooms were spacious, and extremely thoughtfully decorated.\n\nWe also had the pleasure of dining at their Vietnamese restaurant. The food was wonderful and copious and allowed us to try a nice variety of Vietnamese dishes.  Special mention for the incredible edible arrangements that decorated the plates!\n\nLast but not least, a big thank you to the kind staff that took care of us during our stay, always efficiently and always with a smile ! We hope to be able to visit again in the future !",
