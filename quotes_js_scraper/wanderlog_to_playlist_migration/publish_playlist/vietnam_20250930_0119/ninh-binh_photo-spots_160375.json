It all started well, quiet and peaceful. However, when we were about to reach the highlight spot - the complex in the middle of the water, it was also pitch dark. And the journey back to the starting point was eerie. At one point, we were the only boat. Two other boats that were with us also left.\n\nOur poor boat lady, and all of us tried to row now and then, but it wouldn't move any faster. 🤣 But it was also a story to laugh about now!\n\n3 pm would have been the perfect time! Nevertheless, we enjoyed the tour. The booking office looked super pretty in the evening with all the colourful lanterns.",

It is one of the most impressive temples I have seen during my trip to Vietnam. The territory of the temple is large, so you can climb for about 10 minutes to see statues representing different stages of Buddha's life. As a solo traveler, I was unsure if I should spend time at this temple standing aside from main touristic places, but I fell in love with it. It's a magical place I want to return to!\n\nA main hall is dedicated to Buddha, with a large statue surrounded by several smaller ones. There are also two temples dedicated to Ksitigarbha Bodhisattva, and a beautiful Canon temple with a stunning statue. Between them all, you will find elegant altars with statues of Manjushri and other Bodhisattvas made from white jade.",

Interestingly, some scenes from the movie Kong: Skull Island were filmed here, and you can still see some of the filming locations.\nHowever, the boat riders are local villagers who don't speak English and don't explain anything during the ride. When I asked about Kong: Skull Island, they only responded with hand gestures. If I hadn't asked at the right moment, they wouldn't have even pointed it out.\nThe bamboo boat ride lasted around 2.5 hours, with one stop in between and a chance to explore a few beautiful caves.

A guy in a uniform near the pagoda entrance points you into a shack  where an olderly couple gives out tickets and throws random numbers at people. They refuse to tell you how much beforehand, mumbling numbers like 1, writing 5 on the ticket and then asking 10 000 per a bicycle. That's way more than anywhere else. I just laughed and said no, it's too much, auntie and gave them 5k. They didn't get upset at all, meaning they're just trying what people are willing to pay. At the same time a couple with a motorbike was told to pay 25k for their motorbike even though they apparently agreed on 20k beforehand which is still way more than normal. It's okay wanting to make a little money while providing a shade for the bikes but just be honest and upfront, gee. Just park on the street/buy a drink at one of the \"free\" parking places.",

If you go to Ninh Binh, must visit for Christian especially Catholics!\nPhat Diem Cathedral  consisted of one big central church and 4 smaller ones surrounding this main architecture. The churches were beautifully blended of the traditional Vietnamese culture and architecture and the Western religion reflecting in every single corner. The stand out is a pagoda style roof. The interior is very brightly decorated.\nThe interior has a well recognizable Romanesque-like arrangement with its central nave and side aisles separated by wooden columns, terminating in the raised sanctuary. While the interior particulars may be distinctly oriental or Vietnamese in most regards, the basic architectural structure are thoroughly rooted in the Roman basilica.\nYou will feel the youthfulness, vibrant atmosphere of Mass when compared to attending Mass at the western hemisphere churches where there are no young people willing to spend their Sunday morning at church anymore. Here 75% of the Mass attendance are young people,  kids and children!\nWe also met very nice people who greeted us with warmth.",

Our room was described as a “Mountain View” room but the only window was full up against a rock face and so there was no natural light. I found this a bit misleading. We didn't eat at the restaurant as it was very overpriced compared to restaurants in Tam Coc which were fantastic.\n\nOne thing that annoyed me was that one of the manager approached on our first morning. He asked me to give the resort a review despite on being there a few daylights hours. I scanned the QR code and clicked 5 start but wasn't going to submit as it was not honest but he leant over me and clicked submit on my phone. I thought it was very rude and dishonest. In addition to this when we were leaving he put his phone in my girlfriend's face and asked how our stay was. We realised he was voice recording her completely un solicited. We have notice this sort of thing in Vietnam but never like this and from somewhere that wasn't to brand themselves as a high end resort, I thought it was a bit distasteful.",

The boat rides were great and the scenery was amazing.\n\nWe then decided to get the pass for the pool, however, we are now regretting it as 32 teenagers have descended on the place and it's turned into what can only be described as a kindergarten. They are screaming at the top of their lungs, sitting down on other people's loungers, and splashing people and their things. The adults accompanying them and the staff don't seem to care and are allowing this behaviour to continue. If you are expecting a relaxing experience it might be best to save your money and avoid this space. Not what you should expect from a resort.\n\nReply to business: There is no time like the present to review these guidelines. We are still here and the adults leading the group can be told how their kids should act.",

We enjoyed the ride nevertheless.\n\nWe gave the lady on the boat a tip because she did a great job showing us around. Unfortunately, she seemed displeased with the amount, and was not shy to show us her dissatisfaction. I am not sure if they are used to receiving way bigger tips....or why she was so upset. Either way, it was a good experience.",

We cycled to the far end which was fairly challenging, took about 1:45 with some short stops, taking it easy on the downhill stretches as the ground was wet) - the road is overall uphill on the way into the park. Enjoyed a rest for coffee at the park centre, then hiked the loop at the end (took 2:20 including time exploring the cave). Almost had the hike to ourselves. Lunch back at the park centre was fresh, cheap and enjoyable. Cycled back (very grateful for the downhill gradient, apart from a few steep uphill sections) and explored prehistoric cave on the way. Long and tiring day but very worthwhile. The road was mostly free from any traffic - only a few cars and motorbikes passed us all day - and the road surface was good.",

I came up from Ninh Binh and can only recommend doing so if you are in the area it is a quite relaxing drive with the scooter without any traffic.\n\nMake sure to visit the prehistoric human caves and the ancient tree. The tree might not sound too spectacular, but it was probably my favorite thing to do! You have to take a small path into the jungle and you can continue on this path deeper into the jungle if you want (a guide i met on the way told me it goes on for 10km). It is really amazing to experince the jungle this way and no worries, you cannot get lost, the path is quite easy to follow.\n\nAt the end of the road through the park you can find a restaurant for lunch.\n\nThere is also a monkey reservatory but i was too late to visit (it is only open from 13:30 to 16:30).\n\nI highly recommend visitinf this park if you are in the Ninh Binh area!",

The scenery was stunning, and we had an excellent hiking experience with rangers guiding us through the trails.\nHowever, there were some challenges. The insect bites took weeks to heal, and leeches were abundant, we counted around 35 in a single day of hiking, fall down several times as we got a bit of rain and wet.. Outch :). It was still an adventurous and memorable experience, but proper boots and leech socks are essential. Even with those, we were bitten quite badly.\n\nWe didn't encounter any large wildlife, but the night safaris were still a highlight. Thousands of fireflies lit up the forest, a beautiful sight. We also observed a few snakes chasing frogs, birds settling into the leaves for rest, and a variety of fascinating insects and bugs. Toward the end, we were lucky to come across a group of deer.\n\nThe food at the restaurant was generally good, though there is room for improvement. Overall, a rewarding stay for nature lovers, but be prepared for the elements.",

It's about 500 steps up, and while it starts off easy, it definitely gets tougher near the top-so wear something comfy and be ready to sweat a bit.\n\nThe climb is totally worth it though, with stunning scenery once you reach the peak. It's a popular spot, but still feels peaceful in its own way.\n\nPerfect for a quick adventure that gives you a real sense of achievement. 🥾🌄",

If you come in the Lotus flowering season, your eyes will feast on the beautiful flowers that are accessible for endless photo opportunities by several board walks the totality of which are formed when seen from above in a lotus flower. There are lovely little places to sit also and buy some refreshments.  There is also a spa and even a swimming pool te refresh yourself at a reasonable price.\n\nI highly recommend this place for a visit to take your time and enjoy this part of Vietnam.",

Located in Ninh Binh, it offers stunning limestone karsts, lush rice fields, and peaceful waterways that make you feel like you've stepped into a postcard.\n\nThe highlight of Tam Coc is the boat ride along the Ngo Dong River. A friendly local rows the boat-sometimes with their feet!-as you float through three magical caves surrounded by towering cliffs and endless greenery. The scenery is so peaceful and beautiful that you won't want the ride to end.\n\nApart from the boat tour, Tam Coc has so much to offer. You can explore the ancient Bich Dong Pagoda, which is built into a mountain, or rent a bicycle and ride through the golden rice fields. The local food is also amazing, with fresh goat meat and crispy rice being must-tries.\n\nTam Coc is perfect for nature lovers, photographers, and anyone looking to escape the busy city life. Whether you're exploring caves, riding bikes, or just enjoying the peaceful views, this place will leave you in awe. It's truly a hidden gem of Vietnam!",

It's quite serene and unique - going with the row boat through the river, through a cave and then into an open space, surrounded by mountains.\n\nThe ladies rowing the boat are farmers I am told and after their work, they do this as an additional hustle. They row with their feet which is a sight to see, they're quite experienced.\n\nBe warned! And be ready for them to hard sell you trinkets and souvenirs when they reach the end of the river (before turning back). We didn't bring any money but we felt almost hijacked when she wouldn't move the boat until she was truly convinced we couldn't buy anything. The other boats did the same thing, stopped the boat for about 10 minutes until someone bought something (or couldn't).\n\nIt detracted from the overall good experience from the row boat ride. We tipped her generously at the end when we were done and back in land where the money was available but we shouldn't have been held “hostage” for quite a bit of time with the rower giving us a disapproving and unhappy, sour look because we couldn't buy her trinkets.",

Wear appropriate footware as it can be slippery. The amount of want to be  influencers in heels trying to get that instagram worthy picture is the only down side in my opinion.\nIf your after an almost spiritual connection,  go when it opens (before 6am) theres something magical about being on the summit as the day breaks or soon afterwards, you will enjoy peace, incredible views,  and an uncrowded  climb.\nOhh and take your rubbish down with you .",

The climb was alittle steep at points but not too bad, when you get to the junction, the left route takes you higher. Overall a brilliant day. Allocate at least 2 hours for both climbs and the cave.",

The views from the upper level are stunning and truly rewarding. Be prepared though-the stairs are quite steep and can be slippery, even during dry weather, so wear proper shoes.\n\nThe hike to the top can be quite tiring, especially in the hot weather, but once you reach the viewpoint, the breathtaking scenery makes it all worthwhile. It's a perfect spot for photos and enjoying the natural beauty of Ninh Binh from above.\n\nHighly recommended if you're visiting the area-just go early or late in the day to avoid the heat.",
