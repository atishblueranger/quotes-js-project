I went in expecting to learn about history, but I left with something much deeper: a profound reflection on humanity, suffering, and resilience.\nThe exhibits-especially the photographs-were deeply moving. Some images were so raw and disturbing that I almost cried while walking through the galleries. I found myself needing to pause and take time to process what I was seeing. The human cost of the Vietnam War, especially for civilians, was heartbreaking.\n\nWhat struck me most was how personal the museum felt. It doesn't just present facts or military artifacts; it shows the faces, names, and lives of people affected-both Vietnamese and foreign. The section on Agent Orange and its lingering effects across generations was particularly difficult to take in.\n\nI left with a heavy heart but also with a greater understanding of Vietnam's past and an even stronger appreciation for the strength and kindness of its people today. Despite everything the country endured, I was met everywhere with warmth and openness. This visit changed the way I think about war, history, and reconciliation.\n\nIf you're in Ho Chi Minh City, I believe this museum is a must-visit. It's not easy, but it's important.",

            "text": "Amazing little museum. 3 floors of information pertaining to the Vietnam war and it's lasting effects. In particular, I found the “War Photographers” section to be captivating…a lot of stories in there about journalists all over the globe that were intent on capturing the war and the brutality therein, often times paying the ultimate price for their attempts to broadcast the truth. The entire museum could easily take 2-4 hours if you're intent on reading all the descriptions (provided in Vietnamese and English).\n\nOne small note - I didn't see any warnings, but some of the content in here can definitely be unsettling. I'm glad they haven't shied away from this, as it's important to show the horrible effects of the war directly. But there are quite a lot of pictures of dead and mutilated bodies, especially within the “War Crimes” room. Also, there's a large section dedicated to the health ramifications of Agent Orange, showing the deformities (in both children and adults, Vietnamese and foreign) and mental conditions caused by that horrible chemical. I saw a lot of families with young kids in here, and a lot of the children had slightly terrified looks on their faces. I assume if it was affecting to me, it may have been doubly so for them. Again, I recommend coming and not turning your face away from the horrible facts and effects of the war, but if you're sensitive or have young children who may not be mentally prepared for such imagery, you may want to avoid certain exhibits that you feel could include such photographs (mainly War Crimes and Agent Orange are the two areas that are disturbing, I haven't included any pictures from them below).\n\nIf you're in Saigon even a little bit interested in the history and lasting effects of the war, this is a must-visit museum. I visited on a Saturday afternoon and it was crowded, but still easy to see everything.",

The building has 3 levels consist of 7 rooms of war history timeline, consequences, and what's happening now. Some of the contents can be very scary especially the photos captured during the war.\nThe ground floor outside has the replica of jail (Tiger Cages) and torture chamber used by the Vietnamese government to deal with local rebellious. Many army tanks, planes and transport were displayed in front of the building.\nDefinitely interesting to see the war history from the perspective of Vietnamese at this museum.",

            "text": "I recently visited Independence Palace, and I must say, the experience was quite memorable. The palace is absolutely huge much bigger than I had expected. It felt like I was walking through a never ending maze of grand halls, historic rooms, and long corridors. After a while, I actually started to feel tired from all the walking! If you're planning to explore the entire palace, definitely wear comfortable shoes and be prepared to spend a good few hours there.\n\nOne thing I noticed and something that did affect the experience was that many parts of the palace didn't have air conditioning. Given how hot and humid the weather was during my visit, it got quite uncomfortable in several sections. Some rooms were noticeably stuffy, and at times I found myself rushing through just to get back to cooler areas.\n\nThat said, the architecture and historical significance of the palace are undeniable. The design is both elegant and symbolic, and each room seems to hold a story of its own. I especially enjoyed the presidential meeting rooms and the war command center in the basement both were fascinating glimpses into Vietnam's past.\n\nOverall, while the lack of AC in many areas made the visit a bit exhausting, the sheer scale, historical richness, and grandeur of the Independence Palace still made it worth the trip. I'd recommend it, but maybe plan your visit during cooler parts of the day.",

The venue itself is stunning - a beautifully preserved French colonial building, elegant yet intimate, right in the heart of the city.\n\nThe show was nothing short of magical. Through acrobatics, contemporary dance, and live traditional music, it told a wordless yet deeply emotional story - from peaceful village life to the hustle of modern urban Vietnam. The performers were not only skilled but full of soul, using bamboo props and body language to convey meaning with grace and creativity.\n\nAs a Vietnamese, I felt truly proud to see our cultural identity portrayed so artfully on an international stage. What moved me the most was the audience's response - endless applause from visitors across the globe. Those claps weren't just for the show; they were a powerful recognition of the beauty and depth of Vietnamese culture.\n\n🎭 Highlights:\n– Mesmerizing visual storytelling with no spoken words\n– Authentic live music and impressive choreography\n– Intimate atmosphere, perfect lighting and sound\n– Deep emotional connection, regardless of nationality",

Watching the city sparkle from that height would be an unforgettable sight, perfect for a romantic or reflective evening. (There is also a VR experience available, just didn't get to try!)

I highly recommend visiting between 17:30 and 19:00, so you can experience the city transform: first in daylight, then watch the sunset, and finally see the skyline light up at night.",

It's a great place to explore if you're into local culture, street food, and souvenir shopping. The market is packed with stalls offering everything from traditional Vietnamese clothing and silk scarves to spices, coffee, and handmade crafts.\nThe food section is especially exciting-plenty of local dishes like pho, fresh fruit smoothies, and sweet treats. It's a great place to try authentic Vietnamese flavors in a lively setting.\nThe market can get busy and a bit overwhelming, but that's part of the charm. Bargaining is common, so don't hesitate to negotiate prices. There are also fixed-price stalls if you prefer a more straightforward shopping experience.\nCentrally located and open until late, it's a convenient stop whether you're shopping, eating, or just soaking in the local vibe.\nTHERE IS NO AC PLEASE TO WEAR Sleeveless DRESS",

Visitors come not only to shop but also to soak in the vibrant pulse of the city.\n\nHowever, prices at Bến Thành Market are often not fixed. Many stalls tend to quote higher prices, especially to foreign tourists or those unfamiliar with bargaining. To get a fair deal, it's best to check prices at several stalls, compare, and negotiate comfortably – after all, haggling is part of the authentic Vietnamese market experience!\n\nOverall, Bến Thành Market is well worth a visit if you want to catch a glimpse of old Saigon, pick up some local specialties, or find unique souvenirs. Just remember: don't rush to buy from the first stall you see.",

            "text": "We visited the Cu Chi Tunnel on Sunday. It is one of Vietnam's most significant and popular historical attractions, located approximately 55 km (around 1.5 hours) from Ho Chi Minh City.\n\nI highly recommend visiting with a guided day tour rather than going on your own. There is so much detailed history to learn about the Vietnam War that only a knowledgeable guide can explain effectively. The tunnel system here is incredibly extensive, stretching over 250 km underground as our guide shared.\n\nWhat you will see and experience here:\n•\tNarrow tunnels built for escaping and hiding during the war\n•\tSmall spaces and hidden rooms where soldiers used to stay undetected\n•\tUnderground kitchens with cleverly camouflaged smoke outlets\n•\tWeapon-making rooms and storage areas\n•\tSleeping areas, meeting rooms, and various underground living setups\n•\tModels explaining war strategies, traps, and daily life of Vietnamese soldiers\n\nThe most fascinating part is experiencing the tunnels yourself. The tunnels are extremely narrow, dark, and complexly interconnected. It is truly unbelievable how soldiers moved and lived inside them. It was difficult even for us to crawl a short distance, and experiencing it gives you an immense sense of respect for their courage and endurance.\n\nAdditional notes:\n•\tThe entire site is located amidst a dense forest area. If the weather is hot, it can feel extremely humid and uncomfortable, so carrying water, a cap, and wearing comfortable shoes is highly recommended. In pleasant weather, the walk becomes enjoyable.\n•\tThere is a large souvenir shop to buy local items and handicrafts.\n•\tYou can also try shooting at the shooting range (note: this activity is chargeable and not included in the entry ticket).\n•\tEntry ticket costs around 125,000 VND, and I have uploaded a photo of the ticket for reference. This was included in our day tour package.\n\nOverall, visiting Cu Chi Tunnel was an inspiring and humbling experience, showcasing the intelligence, resilience, and determination of Vietnamese soldiers during the war. If you are in Ho Chi Minh City, this place is a must-visit to witness an extraordinary part of Vietnam's history.",

Some of the tour offers you will find on Klook have guides who will take you there and share some basic information, but if you want to enjoy the experience, make sure you find a knowledgeable guide.\n\nThat said, we still enjoyed being able to see the tunnels, the displays, and the bunkers. You will have the option to walk through some of the tunnels aside from the famous photo op where you lift the cover of the manhole. There are tanks there and also a shooting range, but we didn't opt to try that out.\n\nIt's hot, so bring a cap and water, and a mini-fan if you have it. Expect a lot of walking and dust. Remember that it's a literal part of a jungle so don't expect it to be like other museums or educational experiences!",

The place was peaceful and nearly empty, allowing us to explore without any crowds. By the time we left, more visitors had started arriving, so if you prefer a quiet and calm atmosphere, definitely try to go when the doors first open.\nThe museum is beautifully arranged, guiding you step by step through the fascinating history of Vietnam. From ancient civilizations to more recent events, each section flows naturally into the next. We especially enjoyed the displays on ancient wars, traditional weapons, and the evolution of Vietnamese culture. Seeing swords, armor, and other artifacts up close gave us a deeper appreciation of the country's resilience and rich heritage.\nWhat really stood out was how everything is laid out in a way that's easy to follow, even if you're not a history buff. It feels like traveling through time  and learning about Vietnam's past in one thoughtfully curated package.\n\nThe museum itself is housed in a beautiful colonial era building, and the peaceful garden outside adds to the charm. It's not a massive museum, but it's packed with meaningful displays and doesn't overwhelm you with too much at once.\nOverall, it was a highlight of our trip. Whether you're just curious about Vietnam's roots or already passionate about Southeast Asian history, this museum is well worth a visit. Just remember to go early for the best experience!",

The ticket purchase process was also quite long, though it's probably possible to buy them on-site.\n\nTicket prices varied depending on the seating category (indoor, outdoor, rooftop), ranging from around 100k to 350k, if I remember correctly.\n\nOverall, a great experience.",

It only takes about 20 minutes from Bach Dang Port to Binh An Port, but the views along the way are beautiful. You'll pass through some of the city's most modern and charming residential areas.\n\nThe boat moves slowly, which gave me time to enjoy the cool breeze and take in the riverside scenery.\nDefinitely a great little experience for anyone who enjoys discovering new sides of the city.",

The meats are perfectly cooked. The sauces are so well prepared, glossy and sufficiently assertive without being overwhelming. The ratatouille (served with the Patagonia Tooth Fish) was melting, but still had a bit of structure to give an added dimension to the dish.\n\nWe will be back (probably during every visit to HCM).",

No need to learn the Vietnamese because mostly are in actions and sounds. Light and choreography of the puppets were excellent. Worth your money. We bought our ticket online and claimed the physical ticket thru one of the staff in front of the kiosk. Souvenirs were sold outside after the show and it was not that expensive especially the toys and post cards. Definitely all souvenirs were unique and you can buy it only at that place.",

The meal included tea or coffee, but additional drinks could be ordered at an extra cost. The live music performance started indoors, and later, the musicians moved to the open-air upper deck for another performance.\n\nThere were multiple ways to enjoy the scenery-you could step outside to the lower deck's outdoor area or go up to the open-air section on the upper deck. Personally, I found the lower deck to be a great choice. The dining area was well-lit, and stepping outside immediately offered a beautiful river view with no obstructions. Additionally, the lower deck was less crowded and quieter, allowing for a peaceful and uninterrupted experience of the scenery.\n\nThe staff member, Monica, was very warm and welcoming, providing a detailed introduction to the entire cruise. The live performance was also very professional, and the overall ambiance was excellent. Initially, I considered visiting some well-known seafood buffet restaurants in Ho Chi Minh City, but in the end, I chose to take a river cruise on the Saigon Princess, and it turned out to be absolutely worth it. Highly recommended!",

It's a mix of Hindu and Buddhist deities and way of praying. I'm amazed that many locals come here to pray too. It's a beautiful vibe. Sit down for a few minutes and soak in the architectural beauty of the temple, the blend of culture and religion, read the history of the temple (Which I think could be improved) and just pray in which ever practise you follow.",

Nestled in the heart of District 1, this Hindu temple is dedicated to Mariamman, the goddess of rain and disease, and serves as a spiritual hub for both locals and visitors.\n\nThe temple's vibrant and intricate architecture stands out with its colorful statues, detailed carvings, and ornate decorations. Upon entering, you're greeted by the scent of incense and the sound of soft chants, which help create a peaceful ambiance that contrasts sharply with the surrounding urban activity. The temple's peaceful atmosphere invites you to pause and reflect, offering a sense of tranquility that feels almost otherworldly amid Saigon's fast-paced energy.\n\nDespite its relatively small size, the temple is a vital part of the local Hindu community, and visitors often come to pay their respects, pray for blessings, or seek protection from ailments. The temple also serves as a cultural touchstone for the Indian diaspora in Vietnam, preserving ancient rituals and traditions that have been passed down for generations.\n\nWhat makes the Mariamman Temple especially unique is its location in one of the most dynamic areas of the city. Walking through the busy streets, where street vendors and motorcycles bustle by, then stepping into the quiet sanctuary of the temple creates a striking contrast and a reminder of the city's rich cultural and spiritual diversity.\n\nOverall, the Mariamman Temple is an exceptional spot for those interested in exploring the spiritual side of Saigon. Its divine presence amidst the chaos offers a unique experience of serenity and reflection, making it a hidden gem for both spiritual seekers and curious travelers alike.",

The French cuisine is top-notch - perfect for a casual yet dressy dining experience. The duck magret is always cooked to perfection, juicy and full of flavor. I'm absolutely in love with the anchovy chicken salad - it's perfectly balanced and so well made.\n\nWe also tried the cauliflower soup, which was divine, and both the salmon and swordfish. The swordfish had a slightly fishy taste, but the flavors were still incredibly well balanced. And the ratatouille? Genuinely better than what we've had in France - no exaggeration!\n\nAnother thing we love is that they serve a simple hot lemon and honey drink - so hard to find elsewhere! And the juices are always fresh and delicious, made without any added sugar or syrup, which we really appreciate.\n\nThe staff speaks excellent English and always gets the orders spot on. Manager Mathew has been there every time we visited, keeping everything running smoothly and making sure the service is top-notch. Highly recommend",

Really fond of the toasted potatoes, slightly crispy on the cover and well cooked on the inside, the pasta can use some improvements but an Italian dish at a French restaurant is never a right choice to make, but still pretty decent.

Tucked away off an alley in a quiet little courtyard under cover in the rain is cool and feels like you're miles away from the chaos of the city. Cold beer, warm fresh bread and butter when you sit down 🍞🍺 Simple things done right.\n\nJuices were good too especially liked the super orange one.\n\nService was friendly and chill and the whole vibe just felt easy and relaxed.\n\nThey also have indoor dining but outside wasn't hot.

It's like someone thought, “Hey, let's put a giant turtle in the middle of a lake and see what happens!” And it worked brilliantly.\n\nBy day, it's a peaceful spot where you can catch your breath. By night, it turns into a street food haven, with vendors serving up everything from fried squid to corn on the cob.\n\nWhether you're there for the oddball charm or just to grab a bite and chill, this place has got you covered. It's a bit of quirky bliss in the middle of Saigon!",

There's only 2 floors to the Musuem, but the non-sheltered areas house the tanks & the planes.\n\nFound the Museum to be pretty cool, worth the money and experience. Advice would be to stay there, take your time to leisurely look around the items, it really contains a lot of stuff from the past that's really interesting haha.",
