Perched on a hill overlooking the Perfume River, it's a place where history, spirituality, and stunning architecture all come together.\n\nThe star of the show is, of course, the seven-story pagoda itself. Standing tall and proud, it looks like a guardian watching over the city. As you walk through the entrance with its fierce guardian statues, you can't help but feel a little humbled - and maybe slightly judged for all your past sins (don't worry, they seem forgiving).\n\nInside the grounds, there's so much to see: intricate statues, the ancient bell that's as impressive as it is photogenic, and peaceful gardens perfect for a reflective stroll. The atmosphere is calm, even with visitors around, and it's easy to imagine what life must have been like centuries ago when this was a bustling center of worship.\n\nPro tip:\nWear comfortable shoes - the steps are historic (translation: uneven), and take a moment to just sit quietly and enjoy the breeze by the river. It's also a fantastic spot for photography, so bring your camera or phone fully charged.\n\nOverall, Thien Mu Pagoda is a must-visit while in Hue. Whether you're there for the history, the architecture, or just a bit of soul-soothing calm, you'll leave feeling like you've gained a little perspective… and probably a lot of great photos. 📸",

Our guide was a middle-aged man and he spoke so passionately and his knowledge of the place is amazing. One important note is that you should visit this tomb around 3 to 6 PM to avoid hot sun during the day. the sunset light is beautiful. Also noted that the whole place is open for visitors, but the tomb itself is forbidden. Only royal relatives can enter the tomb area once a year to pay tributes. Highly Recommended.",

This attraction was so wonderful, from the gorgeous grounds to wander around to the grand tombs and memorials, everything here seemed ready for an amazing photograph.  The memorials were grand with many steps up to impressive gates, towering columns, and the forests were so peaceful. There was grass under the trees despite the shade, which made it feel lush and relaxing.\n\nThe grounds were so enjoyable to wander around and so well kept, you can imagine what a fine place this was for an emperor, just beautiful. Highly recommended if you are in Hue.",

It's a beautifully laid-out complex with lots of open space to walk around, relax, and take in the views.\n\nThe area is well maintained and shows great care in its restoration efforts. Everything from the stone paths to the wooden pavilions feels thoughtfully preserved. The large lake in the center reflects the buildings and trees beautifully, adding to the tranquil atmosphere.\n\nWe spent about 45 minutes here, but you could easily stay longer if you enjoy photography or just want to soak up the peaceful surroundings. It wasn't too crowded when we went, which made it even more enjoyable.\n\nHighly recommend this one if you're visiting Hue-especially if you're only picking one or two mausoleums to explore. It combines natural beauty, history, and serenity all in one place.\n\nTuesday\t     7 am–5:30 pm\nWednesday.    7 am–5:30 pm\nThursday\t     7 am–5:30 pm\nFriday\t            7 am–5:30 pm\nSaturday\t     7 am–5:30 pm\nSunday\t            7 am–5:30 pm\nMonday\t     7 am–5:30 pm",

The ever-changing lights transition between vibrant green, purple, red, blue, yellow, and even a rainbow sequence, making it a photographer's dream at night.\n\nThe bridge itself is an iconic structure connecting the two sides of Huế, with easy access for pedestrians. It's not a long walk, but it's one you'll want to take slowly to enjoy the views and atmosphere. The lighting setup is really well done-tasteful, modern, and enhances the whole riverside area.\n\nDefinitely worth visiting just before dusk so you can catch the transformation as the lights begin to glow. A great spot for an evening stroll, night photography, or just soaking in Huế's riverside charm.",

            "text": "Từ Đàm Pagoda in Huế is one of the most peaceful and spiritually significant places I've ever visited. Nestled in the heart of the ancient imperial city, this pagoda is not only a place of worship but also a cultural and historical landmark that reflects the deep roots of Vietnamese Buddhism.\n\nWhat makes Từ Đàm Pagoda especially meaningful to me is the legacy of one of its most revered monks: Venerable Thích Trí Quang. I have long admired him for his intellect, his dedication to Buddhism, and especially his work translating and interpreting many important Buddhist texts into Vietnamese. His influence on Vietnamese Buddhism, both in spiritual and cultural terms, is profound. Though he has passed away, his spirit and teachings are very much alive in this sacred space. It was incredibly moving to walk through the grounds and know that this was a place he once walked, taught, and meditated.\n\nThe pagoda itself is beautiful - quiet, clean, and filled with the scent of incense. The architecture is traditional yet timeless, with a large main hall, well-tended gardens, and statues that inspire a deep sense of calm and reverence. The monks and caretakers are kind and respectful, and there is a genuine atmosphere of compassion and wisdom here.\n\nIf you are in Huế and seeking a meaningful spiritual experience - or simply want a quiet space to reflect - I highly recommend visiting Từ Đàm Pagoda. For me, it was more than a visit; it was a moment of connection with history, faith, and the legacy of a great teacher.",

Its tile-roofed architecture and ornate dragon motifs make it a great example of traditional Vietnamese design. It's a peaceful spot to admire the craftsmanship and relax by the water.\n\nThat said, the surrounding village area felt quite deserted and underdeveloped. There are hints that it once had more tourist potential, but today it's very quiet and feels somewhat forgotten. Still, if you're looking to explore something different outside of Hue city, it's worth a short visit.\n\nWe walked the 4.5km from Hue, which made for a decent workout under the sun! While the walk is long and the attraction is relatively small, it's a pleasant side trip-especially if you enjoy historical architecture or scenic photography.\n\nTip: There are some lovely photo angles from across the canal and under the trees. If you're already in Hue and have time to spare, it's a nice detour.",

            "text": "Diệu Đế Pagoda is one of the national pagodas with a long history and unique architecture in Hue. Based on the information I found, my impression of this pagoda is as follows:\n\nRegarding history and culture: Diệu Đế Pagoda holds an important position in the history of Buddhism in Hue, being one of the three pagodas that were declared \"national pagodas\" by Emperor Thiệu Trị and directly patronized by the Nguyễn Dynasty. This demonstrates the pagoda's rich history and profound cultural value. Coming here, you can feel the solemnity and sacredness of an ancient pagoda that has witnessed many ups and downs of the history of the Citadel.\n\nRegarding architecture: Diệu Đế Pagoda impresses with its unique architecture, different from many other pagodas in Hue. It is famous for the \"Nine Dragons Hidden in Clouds\" painting, the largest of its kind in Vietnam. The pagoda's campus is spacious, shaded by green trees, creating a cool and peaceful feeling. Structures such as the Great Awakening Hall (điện Đại Giác), Đạo Nguyên Pavilion (Đạo Nguyên các), Wisdom Room (phòng Trí Tuệ), and Auspicious House (nhà Cát Tường) are harmoniously arranged, bearing the imprint of ancient imperial architecture. In particular, the pagoda also has four low towers at the main gate and two on either side of the main hall, creating a distinctive beauty.\n\nRegarding experience: When you set foot in Diệu Đế Pagoda, you will feel the serene and peaceful atmosphere. This is not only a place of spiritual activities for monks and nuns but also a destination attracting tourists who want to learn about the Buddhist culture, history, and architecture of Hue. Strolling through the pagoda grounds, admiring the ancient buildings, and listening to the sound of the pagoda bell, you can find peace in your soul.\n\nIn summary, Diệu Đế Pagoda is a worthwhile destination to experience in Hue, where you can discover distinctive historical and cultural values and find tranquility in the peaceful space of an ancient temple.",
