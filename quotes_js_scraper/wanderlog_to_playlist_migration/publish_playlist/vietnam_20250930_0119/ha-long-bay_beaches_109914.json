The highlight here is the massive limestone cave - an extraordinary natural wonder. The stunning formations inside the cave are truly breathtaking and worth the experience. However, a friendly but important warning: if you're not ready for a bit of physical effort - like walking up steps, going through a long cave path, and getting down into the island - think twice before getting off. Once you step out, the cruise won't wait. It will sail to the other side of the island to pick you up. That means you must complete the entire walk through the cave to reach the exit point where the cruise will be waiting. So, make sure you're physically ready for a bit of walk, but totally worth it!",

You may also want to spend an overnight here before the cruise or afterwards. (downside is that there is a lot of trash and debris in the water which is disturbing as a “westerner”. There appears to be no effort by the government to require the local operators of the day cruises or the local fisherman to keep the water clean. Vietnam should follow the example of the Philippines in Palawan, where the beautiful waters are treasured, and the scuba diving and snorkeling is phenomenal.)\nWe stayed at the Moon Boutique which is affiliated with Cat Ba Ventures. It's very cute hotel and reasonably priced with a very good breakfast. Cat Ba Ventures will also arrange for your transportation from Hanoi or Ninh Binh/Tam Coc . However, if your budget is a bit higher, consider staying at the 5 star   Perle d'Oriente hotel, which is adjacent to Cat Co 3 beach with a lovely pool, a nice beach, a full pool side bar. Just a note, there is a lot of construction going on by Son world of a huge hotel complex with a man-made beach and yacht Harbour, which commenced in late 2024, and as I understand, it is scheduled to be a five-year project. But if you take the cruise boats, you will not see or be bothered by the construction.(Moon Boutique does look out on the construction. The five star hotel, Perle does not. )",

This small island is a popular stop for cruise ships, and it's easy to see why. Whether you're into hiking, swimming, or just soaking in breathtaking scenery, Titop has something for everyone.\n\nFor those who love a challenge, the climb to the top of the mountain is a must. It's about 400 steps to the summit, and while the hike can be steep and demanding, the panoramic view from the top is absolutely worth the effort. The sight of Ha Long Bay from above, with its emerald waters and scattered islands, is truly awe-inspiring and makes the climb more than rewarding.\n\nIf you prefer a more relaxed experience, the island's beach is a great place to unwind. The white sand is soft and clean, continuously washed by the tide, and the water is clear and inviting for a swim. Whether you choose to lounge on a deckchair or take a dip in the sea, the beach offers a peaceful escape from the bustling tourist spots.\n\nThe island also holds historical significance, named after a Russian general who helped Vietnam during the war, adding a unique cultural layer to the visit.\n\nOverall, Titop Island is a must-visit destination in Ha Long Bay. Whether you're climbing to the top for a breathtaking view or relaxing on the pristine beach, this island offers an unforgettable experience. Highly recommended for anyone exploring the bay!",

It is clean, with shallow water perfect for swimming. The sand here is softer and better than Cat Co 2, with no rocks at the bottom. While Cat Co 2 has slightly clearer water, it also has a rocky bottom. A nearby market within walking distance offers great food and shopping options. You can also use a public shuttle service to the main market for just 5,000 dongs PP. The big hotel in the back ruins the view. One can use loungers, shower or pay for food and drinks from these very hotels. I personally feel bathroom and shower can be used in these hotels. It is decently charged.",

The breakfast and brunch on the second day was also Great with a really wide range of choice, You could carry on going up buffet style until you were full.\nThe staff constantly topped up our water and made sure we were satisfied. The cocktails were brilliant and they would come and find you on the deck once they had made your drink.\n\nYou must try the Vietnamese coffee onboard this was also really good.\n\nHonestly our only regret was that we didn't book a longer stay with them. I would happy go back and stay on the Dragon Legend again and I would recommend it to anyone.",

            "text": "We did the 3 day 2 night tour on the Dragon Pearl 1 and had an amazing time - it was definitely a highlight of our Vietnam trip!  Peter, our guide, was fantastic!  He was very knowledgeable and had the best energy.  The ship staff is so kind and accommodating as well.  The food and drink on the boat are amazing - you will not go hungry!  Great itinerary, I'm glad we did the 3 day tour because it allowed us to see more and enjoy a bit of a slower pace.  Would definitely recommend Indochina Junk, they're a very well run company.",

Beautifully designed with a cozy, elegant interior and a bathtub facing a huge window with the most stunning views. Taking a bath while watching the limestone cliffs glide by was something truly special.\n\nThe boat was beautiful in every corner, with a calm and quiet atmosphere that made the whole experience feel luxurious and relaxed.\n\nThe staff were incredibly friendly and professional, always smiling and ready to help, and our guide Kenny was truly amazing -knowledgeable, kind and made every part of the trip enjoyable.\n\nWe loved the mix of activities, kayaking, cave visits, and just enjoying the peaceful scenery. Every meal was delicious, fresh, and thoughtfully presented. Even as a vegetarian I received my own menu with the most delicious meals and felt really well taken care of.\n\nIf you're looking for a more intimate, off-the-beaten-path cruise with comfort and heart, Indochina Junk is the best choice. We are so thankful for the experience and will always remember it!",

Potable water is the biggest concern.\n\n- Most of them are fisherman and currently due to tourism they took up the role of boatman/boatwoman which is better paying than fishing.\n\n- Overall good experience to understand the life in middle of water and mountains.",

Once you board a row boat, all the sound disappears and and all that can be heard is birds calling and the sound of the oars stirring the water.  The views are great and the rowers will take the boats very close to the rocks giving brief chances to see sea life.",

But they didnt last on land long and moved back to the floating village. They survive on tourism and their fishing although stocks appear to be dwindling. Make sure you give them a good tip as they only get one tour per day. Yes that one boat ride is only chance they have to earn money.",
