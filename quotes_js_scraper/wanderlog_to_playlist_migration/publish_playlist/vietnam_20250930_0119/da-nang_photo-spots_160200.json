On every ride, it was either just a couple of other people or no one else at all. Most of the attractions were closed, but honestly, we went there mainly for one thing – The Queen Cobra. And it didn't disappoint – super thrilling, a bit scary in a good way, and definitely worth it.\n\nThere are more rides available for kids, and I think they'd enjoy the park more overall. If you're planning to go on the Ferris wheel, do it after sunset or around golden hour – the city views are way better with the lights on or with the sun going down.\n\nThe park itself is really beautiful, clean, and well-designed – definitely some cool spots to take photos or just walk around. But don't expect to spend a whole day there – 2 to 4 hours tops is more than enough, especially since a lot of stuff isn't operating.\n\nImportant tip: bring cash. None of the food or shops inside the park accept cards, which was a bit inconvenient.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice park, more suited for families with kids, but I'd still recommend getting the ticket with rides – even if it's just for the Queen Cobra. Totally worth it for that one ride alone.",

Bottled water and fizzy pop is around 20k VND, snacks are sold around the park too which are equally inexpensive. We paid for the unlimited tickets at 250k VND for each adult and 125k VND for kiddo - which in comparison to UK theme parks is really cheap. I'm not convinced we kicked the butt out of the 'unlimited' rides but we certainly had a good time. Highly recommended!",

The Dragon Bridge itself is already impressive by day, but at 9:00 PM on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, it truly comes alive.\n\nThe show started right on time and lasted about 10–15 minutes. First, the dragon breathed fire-giant bursts that lit up the night sky. Then came the water spray, which was just as fun (though be warned: if you're standing close, you will get wet!).\n\nAm also visit Son tra night market which is walkable",

We attended on a Sunday and discovered that standing on the road beneath the bridge provides a much better view, as standing too close doesn't give you the full perception of the dragon breathing fire.\n\nThe show lasted for 15 minutes, during which the dragon breathes fire and sprays water. Be prepared to get wet if you stand close, or stay further back if you want to remain dry.\n\n- The entire road gets blocked during the show\n- You might not be able to get Grab taxis immediately after\n- It's better to walk about 1 km away from the bridge to book cabs for better availability\n- The distance also gives you a better overall view of the spectacle\n\nOverall, it's an impressive display worth seeing, just plan your transportation accordingly!",

            "text": "Han River Bridge, Da Nang – A Mesmerizing Nighttime Marvel\n\nAs the sun sets and Da Nang's skyline begins to glow, the Han River Bridge transforms into a stunning spectacle of light and movement, capturing the soul of this modern coastal city. Known as Vietnam's first swing bridge, it spans the Han River in the heart of Da Nang, serving both as a functional passage and a symbolic icon of the city's growth and innovation.\n\nAt night, the bridge comes alive in brilliant colors. LED lighting systems illuminate the structure in shifting hues-blues, purples, golds, and reds-that reflect beautifully on the water below. These glowing reflections ripple with the movement of the river, creating a scene that's both peaceful and dynamic. The constant color transitions add a layer of visual drama, making it a favorite spot for photographers, couples, and nighttime strollers.\n\nOne of the most magical experiences is witnessing the bridge swing open, which typically occurs around midnight on weekends and public holidays. The central span slowly rotates on its axis to allow large vessels to pass-a rare and captivating event that attracts both locals and tourists alike.\n\nSurrounding the bridge, Da Nang's riverside promenade is equally enchanting. Buildings, hotels, and nearby attractions like the Dragon Bridge and Tran Thi Ly Bridge are also lit up, creating a continuous chain of lights along the riverbanks. Streetlights, cafés, and rooftop bars add to the vibrancy, offering plenty of places to sit, sip, and soak in the view.\n\nThe Han River Bridge at night reflects Da Nang's unique blend of technology, culture, and natural beauty. It's not just a way to cross the river-it's a celebration of modern Vietnam under a starlit sky.",

The food was outstanding and beautifully presented, the scenery is amazing and atmospheric. Worth the price, which isn't that bad at all. 1.5m dong for 5 people mains and desserts, and drinks.",

It's not just a tourist spot-it's a really important part of daily life for the locals, too. Its unique design has really helped put Da Nang on the global travel map.\n\nThe best part? The middle of the bridge actually swings open at 11:00 PM on weekends and holidays. It's a cool sight that a lot of tourists love to watch!",
