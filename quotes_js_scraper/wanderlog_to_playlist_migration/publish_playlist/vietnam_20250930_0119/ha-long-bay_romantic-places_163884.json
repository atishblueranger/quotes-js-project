He was an absolute star: kind, resourceful, always ready to help, and incredibly smart. He made our trip even more special!\nThe boat itself is a vision of luxury, yet it maintains a wonderfully intimate atmosphere. Our room was spacious and gorgeous, and the shower room was out of this world-truly a highlight! Evenings were a blast, especially the fun karaoke nights.

There were also no kids, and most of the other travelers were couples. It was the best decision- we loved the small and intimate setting. David and Mina and all of the staff provided excellent service and we enjoyed the value of the many happy hours (buy one get one free drinks). The weather was pretty cloudy during our trip but that didn't stop us from having an amazing time.\n\nIf we could do it again, I would pick the same boat and the same trip duration. We passed by a lot of other boats that we had considered and many of them just seemed too loud or didn't look as nice as they did online. There were people on our boat who only did the one night stay and I think they felt like it was a little rushed. If you have the time, I recommend 2 nights.",

We were very pleased to find we had been upgraded to the King suite which was beautifully decorated in traditional style with a jacuzzi tub in the bathroom and a large private deck. Jimmy was an excellent cruise manager.  We enjoyed the kayaking around the bay and the tai chi at sunrise was a great experience. The food was plentiful and well presented although it was mainly seafood which we enjoyed but it may not be to everyone's taste. The staff in the restaurant took great care of us,especially Kent. We had fun dressing up in traditional costumes for dinner. We would have liked to have cruised through more scenery as we did spend a lot of time at anchor but this was the same for all the cruise companies by the looks of it.  I am glad we chose Nostalgia as their 2 vessels only have 10 cabins.  Many others carried more passengers. The smaller ships offer a more personal service.",

Though, there was a communication difficulty when it came to ordering room service. Also, the breakfast spread was bountiful and delicious, offering a great variety of local and international options. Special mention of the coffee where it had hints of cocoa.

Ha Long Bay itself isn't very busy during certain seasons, so if you're looking to unwind without the hustle and bustle, this place works well. The staff were truly wonderful-friendly, welcoming, and very accommodating. They even upgraded our room, which was a lovely gesture and very much appreciated.\n\nHowever, a few things didn't quite live up to the standard you might expect from Novotel or Accor more broadly. The property feels like it needs some maintenance and refreshing-it's starting to show its age in both the common areas and the rooms.\n\nBreakfast was okay-decent variety and quality-but again, not quite on par with other Accor hotels I've stayed at. It felt more basic and lacked the polish or wider selection you usually see in similar properties.\n\nThere's also not a whole lot to do around the hotel, so if you're planning to stay here, just be mindful that it's more suited for a short, quiet stay rather than an action-packed holiday.\n\nOverall, the staff really elevate the experience, but the hotel could use some improvements to meet the usual standards of the Novotel brand.",

The area's colorful culture is evident in the floating villages, where we observed local life. With fewer tourists, Lan Ha Bay provides a more intimate experience of Vietnam's natural wonders. It's an ideal destination for those seeking tranquility and unspoiled beauty in a romantic setting. We paid the tour 650k from our Hotel: The Wave View Hotel. Tour starts 8.30am and finishes at 5pm.

This small island is a popular stop for cruise ships, and it's easy to see why. Whether you're into hiking, swimming, or just soaking in breathtaking scenery, Titop has something for everyone.\n\nFor those who love a challenge, the climb to the top of the mountain is a must. It's about 400 steps to the summit, and while the hike can be steep and demanding, the panoramic view from the top is absolutely worth the effort. The sight of Ha Long Bay from above, with its emerald waters and scattered islands, is truly awe-inspiring and makes the climb more than rewarding.\n\nIf you prefer a more relaxed experience, the island's beach is a great place to unwind. The white sand is soft and clean, continuously washed by the tide, and the water is clear and inviting for a swim. Whether you choose to lounge on a deckchair or take a dip in the sea, the beach offers a peaceful escape from the bustling tourist spots.\n\nThe island also holds historical significance, named after a Russian general who helped Vietnam during the war, adding a unique cultural layer to the visit.\n\nOverall, Titop Island is a must-visit destination in Ha Long Bay. Whether you're climbing to the top for a breathtaking view or relaxing on the pristine beach, this island offers an unforgettable experience. Highly recommended for anyone exploring the bay!",

You may also want to spend an overnight here before the cruise or afterwards. (downside is that there is a lot of trash and debris in the water which is disturbing as a “westerner”. There appears to be no effort by the government to require the local operators of the day cruises or the local fisherman to keep the water clean. Vietnam should follow the example of the Philippines in Palawan, where the beautiful waters are treasured, and the scuba diving and snorkeling is phenomenal.)\nWe stayed at the Moon Boutique which is affiliated with Cat Ba Ventures. It's very cute hotel and reasonably priced with a very good breakfast. Cat Ba Ventures will also arrange for your transportation from Hanoi or Ninh Binh/Tam Coc . However, if your budget is a bit higher, consider staying at the 5 star   Perle d'Oriente hotel, which is adjacent to Cat Co 3 beach with a lovely pool, a nice beach, a full pool side bar. Just a note, there is a lot of construction going on by Son world of a huge hotel complex with a man-made beach and yacht Harbour, which commenced in late 2024, and as I understand, it is scheduled to be a five-year project. But if you take the cruise boats, you will not see or be bothered by the construction.(Moon Boutique does look out on the construction. The five star hotel, Perle does not. )",

There were no pillows on them.\n\nThe route was not as advertised; instead of going to Cat Ba, we went to Ha Long and it was a shorter trip.\n\nThe buffet food was cold and not very special. They tried to serve Western-style food like spaghetti, but it wasn't a success.\n\nThe rooms were very good and, along with the staff, perhaps the only aspects of the cruise that felt five-star. However, note that the beds consist of two single mattresses that tend to slide apart.\n\nThe staff was extremely friendly and did their best to make the stay as pleasant as possible.\n\nThere were some enjoyable activities such as kayaking and fishing, which added a nice touch to the experience. However, the gym on board was very small, poorly equipped, and the air conditioning didn't work, making it uncomfortable to use.\n\nWe paid $140 per person for a senior suite. It was advertised as a five-star cruise.\nPerhaps it qualifies as five stars by Asian standards, but definitely not by European ones. The food in particular was far below expectations.",

Thanks so much, you were so kind!\n\nFOOD | sometimes way too much food for 4 people on activities on the Cat Ba Island. About the buffet, the first served lunch is really good but then the self service buffets are redundant and a lot of fried things. Cocktails are really good and not expensive\n\nCLEANLINESS | I had to ask for other bedsheets because they seemed grey-ish and stained. Also asked for more toilet paper and towels. Everything was fine about that. The bath is impressive with the window. The pool looks disgusting would not go in it.\n\nOverall, it's not like the American or European cruise lines we usually use, but really great for Vietnam!!!! :)",

            "text": "Bái Thơ Mountain (Núi Bài Thơ) is one of the most famous tourist destinations in Ha Long, Quang Ninh, offering both stunning natural beauty and historical significance. Located in the heart of Ha Long City, the mountain stands as an iconic landmark, attracting visitors with its breathtaking views and cultural heritage.\n\nThe mountain, with an elevation of 200 meters, is not particularly high, but it provides a magnificent panoramic view of Ha Long Bay, which is known for its emerald waters and thousands of limestone islands. From the summit, visitors can enjoy a 360-degree view of the bay, the bustling city, and nearby islands, making it an ideal spot for photography and sightseeing. The view from Bái Thơ Mountain is especially mesmerizing at sunset, when the sky is painted with shades of orange and pink, creating a peaceful and scenic atmosphere.\n\nIn addition to its natural beauty, Bái Thơ Mountain is also historically significant. At the top of the mountain, there is an ancient stone inscription with the words “Bái Thơ,” which means “poetry offering,” created by King Le Thanh Tong in 1468. The inscription honors the natural beauty of Ha Long Bay and the poetic spirit of the region. It is said that the king visited the mountain to enjoy the view and compose poetry, which further adds to the cultural appeal of the site.\n\nFor those visiting Ha Long, climbing Bái Thơ Mountain is a must-do activity. The hike is relatively easy and takes around 20-30 minutes, making it accessible to most visitors. The trail is lined with trees and steps that lead to the top, where the magnificent view awaits. Whether you're a nature lover, a photography enthusiast, or a history buff, Bái Thơ Mountain offers an unforgettable experience.",

            "text": "I seldom leave review but I think it is necessary to provide some useful guidance for those hiking enthusiasts.\n\nA big thanks to Theresa Lou (the last review before me) who had clearly pointed out that the entrance to the mountain is 106 Hang Noi, which is totally different from the information that can be found on the website (which mentions the blue door beside a photocopy shop).\n\nIn fact, I have passed by the blue door when taking a grab. If you are taking a grab, you can put the address as 86 Hang Noi. Do note that 106 Hang Noi is not directly facing the main street. So after you alight, look for a lady and say the word ‘mountain'. She will respond to you if she is the right person and she will ask you to walk through the alley and she will meet you at the behind of her house.\n\nYou will enter her house and climb the stairs to the third floor which leads to the outside gate. The lady will continue to guide you and you will see a long ladder which you will need to move it together with her and put it against the rock wall. She then asked for money, and I directly gave VND100K and she accepted it.\n\nThe most challenging part is to climb the ladder and hike towards the left direction until you see a proper walk path with wooden fence. Then just continue the path until to the top of the mountain. I spent around 20 minutes from climbing the ladder to the summit, which was considerably fast.\n\nRest assured that the view is totally rewarding and you will be amazed by the scenery!",

I used the house number 86. Most of the trail has a good path made of concrete but no maintenance, I think they made that to reach the internet antenna up on the viewpoint. After entering house number 86 I paid 100.000 and started my walk. The beginning is hard as you can see in the first video. You have to use the ladder and then climb the mountain slightly. This part is dangerous, but after that, it's okay. I recommend you do the trail early in the mourning because there is no shade at all and it was so hot up there",

Everyone was so friendly and made us feel so welcome and special.\n\nWe really enjoyed the food and were always well-fed. The activities were also quite enjoyable. I can understand that some aspects are repeated so I don't recommend more than maybe 2 nights (3 max). 1 night does feel a bit rushed.\n\nThe things that were repeated included some lunch buffet items, cooking demo, squid fishing. However daytime excursions didn't have overlap and there were still enough things you could do to try a bit of a variety.\n\nThe rooms were beautiful and clean. We slept very comfortably in these beds. There was also a lot of space and we were lucky enough to have an adjoining room for our family of 4.\n\nThis cruise is also the only one we found here that had a water slide. That was a must-do for sure! Great for both kids and adults alike. The jacuzzi and pool were fantastic for relaxing in too.\n\nOur excursion on Cat Ba Island with the bike riding was so much fun and very beautiful.\n\nI highly recommend this cruise!!!",

The staff is very nice and they are extremely efficient. They offer basic drinks and there is a small shop behind the shop if you want additional food or drinks before you board the boat shuttle (about 45 mins to the main boat). There is indoor and outdoor seating. There are toilets here as well. There are also several shops nearby. We bought a bottle of wine to take on the boat. You can drink your personal liquor in your room.\n\nAs for the boat…\n\nWe weren't sure which cruise line to select because there are so many. Halong Hub helped us select this cruise ship based on our desires, and it was a great choice.  We had a wonderful time. The crew was excellent. We particularly loved Roy, who took care of us in the dining room.  He has a wonderful personality and made sure we were taken care of.  The food options were great, and all of the food was very good. The boat is in good shape. We decided to splurge and book the Presidential Suite. It was well worth it. We had the entire front end of the boat which worked perfectly because our son and daughter-in-law had another room. They were able to spend quality time with us in our room and on our own deck.",

Just two days before the cruise, my partner and I got engaged, and the staff made our stay feel extra special. During dinner, they surprised us with a beautifully decorated table and a fun singing ritual that made the moment even more memorable.\n\nEverything on board was perfectly organized, from the activities to the meals. The food was delicious, and we were especially well taken care of by Ann, who served us during dinner. She was incredibly professional, knowledgeable, and warm. Thank you for teaching us a few Vietnamese words along the way, that made it even more fun!\n\nA special thank you also to Tam, who made sure everything ran smoothly. I had a really lovely conversation with her and felt a genuine connection. The way she treated both me and my fiancé was heartwarming and sincere.\n\nWe absolutely recommend Mon Cheri Cruise to anyone visiting Ha Long Bay. Thank you all for making this such a meaningful and beautiful memory for us.",

From a private car pickup to the waiting area at the marina to boarding the boat we were welcomed and appreciated. Everyone was friendly and they were ready for us.  As always, I love a welcome drink (refreshing cold green tea) and a cool towel upon arrival.  The food was outstanding, especially their salad. We had different seafood and meats, lots of fruit and spring rolls. I loved their oysters! They offer a large selection of ice cold beer and delicious mixed drinks. EXCURSIONS ARE AMAZING!!! During our 24 hours we went to a huge cave that was astounding, mountain climbing to the top of an island with breathtaking views, swimming at the beach, learned how to make spring rolls, toured  a Pearl Farm, Kayaked and attempted squid fishing with bamboo polls. We even started the morning with a personal Ti Chi class after a picture perfect sunrise. Through out the adventures Quang shared stories with us, told us history and pointed out unique sights along the way.  We enjoyed talking to him and he was great at answering our questions.  It was sad to leave him as he was so much fun to be around.  This trip is worth every penny.  There is a lot of development in the area so be sure to go ASAP!!! Pro Tip: bring water with you, you can buy small bottles on the boat for about $1.50 US.",

With a whole range of options to choose from we selected Paradise as they came well recommended. Additionally we chose the smaller vessel (Peak) anticipating a more personalised and private experience and we were not disappointed! The registration point is about 45 minutes from Haiphong airport. Grabs easily available. Avoid the taxi guys who try and cancel your grab booking at the ‘same price'! From the welcome staff, butlers, safety briefing to our final goodbye on day 3, we were superbly taken care off by the service crew. Shout out to Genesis, Crystal, the Chef and always smiling Captain! The suites were well appointed and large. The spa/jacuzzi was great too. Food was superb and always overflowing. We were stuffed to the gills. For some reason the chefs assumed that we had dietary restrictions (vegetarian) and when we made it very clear that we had none, they worked well to ensure that we had a full menu. A nice choice of wines (sparkling and regular) as well as spirits and cocktails kept us buzzing till late in the evening! The excursions were nice - a bit touristy but as this was a small vessel we were ahead of the crowds many times so had peace and tranquility for a bit before things got congested. Ha Long Bay was a unique and unforgettable experience.",

If this constitutes 3 young girls, who 90% of the time were on their phones chatting or nowhere to be seen or heard, then wonderful, but it's not what I'd expect. Yes, they were lovely people, but no, they not did provide any service or care. Utter marketing rubbish.\n\nThe boat itself was so tired and battered. I slept for 2 hours as I spent the entire night trying to wedge the windows with toilet paper as they rattled so much. The bathrooms had more mould in them than a vintage cheese. The jacuzzi in the bathroom didn't work and when it nearly did, I'm surprised I wasn't electrocuted!\n\nBar staff and drinks?… nope. Yes, drinks were offered after dinner, but when sitting outside for post drinks, we were sat in darkness with no bartender to be seen and this was at 21:00!\n\nWe struggled to find and then make up our own sun loungers and seating on the sun deck. Oh woah is you, I hear you say. But when paying £600 per night, yes £600 per a night, I'd expect something so simple to be prepared!\n\n‘You will spend the night in a secluded bay relaxing and enjoying the fresh night air'. No, we did not. We were sat in a bay with around 30 other huge boats, with all their sound systems screaming and dazzling lights glaring away. Congested and polluted. It was actually very sad. The air was thick with fumes, so much so, I resorted to my inhaler to breath! Again, whilst trying to sleep, I couldn't, as lights the brightness of Time Square shone into my room!\nIt's a shame. As this area is so unbelievably beautiful (in pictures) but in real life it's the perfect example of cash cow tourist.\nThe only saving grace for me, was a seaplane ride the following day. This was soooo much fun and allowed me to actually see for myself the beauties Ha Long Bay has to offer.\nI will add… the reasons for 2 stars. 1 star for the staff and if useless, were at least very kind and friendly. The 2nd star for the fresh bed linen!",

Paradise Peak boat is stylish, elegant while displaying real style and culture. The room was exceptional with big views out to the bay, even in the bathroom. The food was also magnificent, with huge amounts of seafood, Vietnamese and western food on offer. The variety and choice available was fabulous, as was the choice of drinks available.\nThe crew were courteous, kind and could not do enough for us, from explaining the details of the bay and the boats to taking photos and looking after us on excursions.\nIt is truly a trip of a lifetime and an experience we will never forget. Thank you so much.",
