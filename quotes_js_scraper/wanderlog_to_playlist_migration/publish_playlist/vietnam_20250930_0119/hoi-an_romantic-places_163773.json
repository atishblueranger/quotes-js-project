I received the bamboo tension massage and I thought the whole time ( or most of the time) would be used with the bamboo. It was more like a nice finishing touch. Which is fine because my massage therapist's hands were magical. Just an FYI the bamboo is similar to a hot stone massage, just a bit at the end. Yummy mango when you finish as well. Overall I was very pleased and would recommend!",

She made the entire process smooth, fun, and stress-free.\nIn just two days, they tailored two suits for my boyfriend and created three bottoms and three tops for me, all perfectly fitted and beautifully made. The quality, attention to detail, and level of service exceeded our expectations.\nWe highly recommend Two Ladies Tailor to anyone visiting Hôi An.

I ended up getting a semi-formal dress and a wrap top. I needed a couple of extra fittings for the dress and we only had 1.5 days to have it correctly fitted. Lee was super helpful in suggesting adjustments and getting it to look just right before we took it home. I really appreciate that they worked so hard and quickly to make sure we left as happy customers, and I'm so happy with the results. Would definitely recommend.",

We cruised through the busy streets of Da Nang and then headed out to some quieter, scenic spots. Vu took us to some really cool places-hidden temples, local villages, and some incredible views of the coastline. We even stopped for lunch at this great little spot near the beach.\n\nVu's riding skills were top-notch, and he made sure we were safe and comfortable the whole time.

            "text": "My friend and I, visiting from the USA, had strongly considered getting a tailored suit made for each of us while visiting Hoi A last year in April 2024. We ended up not - and regretted it! 🥲\n\nWe waited an entire year to make sure we could do it this time! Lana Tailor had many good reviews on Google, plus we liked a coffee and juice shop next door to it. So all roads lead to Lana Tailor!\n\nWe casually walked into the shop in the morning around 9:30am and we were greeted so warmly and kindly by Enzie. She was smiling, spoke English clearly [which was important, as we know so little Vietnamese!], and immediately launched into explaining the process, in detail, of having a suit tailor-made. She presented so much information to us, yet never pressured us to make any sale. It made us feel valued as potential customers in the experience, rather than just about a transaction. We told her we would think about it and return if we decided to move forward.\n\nReflecting on how Enzie was the most thorough in explaining the process and seemed to be so highly skilled in it, we decided we wanted to return and commit to Lana Tailor. Gosh, are we so glad that we did. 🥰\n\nBeyond the product itself, we felt like we had an entire experience! And every phase was so much fun. The total timeline for two suits - one for a man and one for a woman - was about 32hrs. One Day One, we were working with Enzie and her team by about 11:00. We gave a general idea of the design and color we each desired and she and her staff assisted us in determining the best fabrics, colors, and patterns to fulfill that vision. In moments of being indecisive, there was no pressure – only enthusiastic expertise and joyful guidance offered. “It's important you get what you want - you've come all this way!” she'd remind us. It was clear that Enzie genuinely cared about us being pleased and having a positive experience. We felt like she really came alongside of us in the process and invested with her heart.\n\nAfter we selected the fabrics, it was closer to 11:40. Enzie and her staff then took our measurements. Each person maybe required about 15 minutes of her time to capture all of our sizing. She was very focused and detail-oriented to make sure that the suites would fit us perfectly.\n\nWe wrapped up with pricing and gave half the amount in cash at that time; we would present the other half when we picked up the completed suites. They did offer to take credit card, but it would require a higher percentage of fee, so we therefore elected to stop at the ATM about one block up from them. Enzie kindly gave us directions. A woman's suit starts around $120/$135, depending on upgrades in fabrics and cosmetic stitching details. It seemed very fair and competitive to other places to which we compared. My friend's men's suit was ten dollars higher in total….\n\n[continue into photos for full, positive review caption]\n\n****GOOGLE REViEW limited the character count for this review. 🙈 My full account is in the photos as screenshots pages 1 through 4. 🙂",

I came to Lana with my wife after checking out a few shops in Hoi An.\n\nWhat brought me here was the staff's friendliness, knowledge of clothes-making and the reasonable price that the shop quotes for different grades of suit/clothings. I would like to thank Enzie for the incredible assistance to my wife and I. We ordered several pieces of clothings (men/women)and had the 1st fitting for all in just four (4) days.  Thereafter, minor adjustments were made and the clothings were ready to be collected within the same day.  The efficiency of this shop is amazing.\n\nEnzie is very friendly, patient and approachable.  She is also very experienced in this trade and her style and tailoring advice were on point. Please come to Lana Tailor whenever you are in Hoi An if you wish to make suits/clothings. Remember to look for Enzie.",

Awesome choreography, combined with world class sound, lighting, laser works and pyrotechnics. The performers work extremely hard for this performance, often starting with the mini shows around the theme park until the grand finale show from 5-9pm.\n\nThe show ticket allows you to enter the theme park around 4pm. You may feel underwhelming as you may be the only person there at this time. Good for picture taking at good spots without the crowd. Then at close to 5pm, the crowd starts to trickle in, when the mini shows start and keep you entertained until 7pm, where you have 1hr dinner time at the many restaurants. They are reasonably priced. 8pm is where the grand finale show starts at the main stadium. I'd recommend you buy the Hi-class ticket for the best experience. It's situated right at the middle with good height and distance. VIP seatings may be a little too high up and far to experience the sight and sound, but you get individual chair and table though.\n\nWill definitely return to watch the show again in the future.",

As it cooled on the table, there's no way one could pass up a slice.   Two slices later and we now can't wait to try their other home baked goodies!  You can feel the pride in the owners? staff…And that's really special yet uncommon !!!!\n\nThank you for a great morning and we will see you again very soon!!!",

I have to give him the best credit because he pulled of a very difficult song from AC/DC Thunder Struck. I don't think even native Australia could pull this off. He is awesome . Every note, screaming he did it well . The whole audience scream and laughing at the same time because he is that good. The guy has a voice. I'll definitely be back.

The space is vast, with different rooms and sections, yet it manages to feel warm and inviting despite how busy it can get.\n\nThe service is excellent - well-organized and attentive, even at peak hours. As for the food, everything we tried was flavorful and well-executed. A special highlight was the sizzling beef with black pepper - bold, aromatic, and deliciously peppery. Some of the other dishes also leaned towards strong, punchy flavors, which we personally enjoyed.\n\nOverall, a great dining experience with rich tastes and a vibrant setting. Definitely worth a visit when in Hoi An.",

If you enjoy strong, savoury tastes, you'll likely appreciate their offerings more. Highlights include the fried turmeric noodles and baby calamari - both well-executed and flavorful. However, the grilled scallops were a miss for us; they were overwhelmingly salty, masking the natural taste of the scallop.\nDesserts offered a pleasant surprise with a wide selection that wasn't overly sweet - a nice balance to the savory dishes. Their signature cocktails are also worth trying: reasonably priced, well-mixed, and notably not watered down. You can really taste the alcohol distinctly. Lastly, great river view if you sit at higher floors. Definitely a good bonus!",

We noticed that the taste of the teriyaki unagi sauce was slightly different from what we're used to, but it was still flavorful and delicious. The presentation of the dishes is impressive, from the thoughtful little sauce holders to the overall restaurant setup. Every detail counts, and it all comes together to make this a fantastic dining experience.",

Although we are not big fans of Japanese food, but dishes and drinks here were so delicious!\n\nWe tried Kaiso salad, Umibudo salad, Edamame, Misoshiru soup, Unadon, Sesame Ice Cream, Special Japanese ice cream YUZU lime, passion fruit and watermelon fresh juices and Oolong Ginseng. These food and drinks were enough for 2 ladies :) Sesame ice cream was so great so we ordered it 2 more times :)) I'm happy I tried Chargrilled Japanese eel for the first time here because if it's not enough grilled, it can be dangerous for your health. But here I was calm about the quality and taste.\n\nDecorations and details were beautiful.\n\nThank you so much Nhi, Nhan, Mui, Nhung for our amazing dinner! Food, drinks and service were just amazing.",
