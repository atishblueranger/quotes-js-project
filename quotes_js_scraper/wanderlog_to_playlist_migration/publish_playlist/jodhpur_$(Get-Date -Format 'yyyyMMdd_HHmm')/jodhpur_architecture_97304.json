The Guide informed that this palace was built during the famine in the 1920s when the then Maharaja Umaid Singh offered the people food for their work so that people would not sleep without food. People worked in building the palace and in lieu of it they received food. Construction work started in 1929 and was completed in 1943. The museum opens at 10 am and closes at 5 pm on all the days of the week. So one has to reach at least before 3 pm to visit this museum completely.",

They have a toy train service to transport one to the other end of the mandore. The garden premises consists of Cenotaphs, temples, museum, palace, recreation place, large mughal style water fountain and few amenities to cater to the tourists. The entrance fee per person is 40 bucks. The toilets can be much better in cleanliness. The museum inside has a separate entry fee of 20 bucks per head. Overall it will take around 2 to 3 hrs to explore this garden if one is a lover of art and architecture. This place even has a light and sound show in the evening for which one will have to pre book. This is situated at an outskirts of Jodhpur so one will really have to insist the driver to take there. Highly recommended!",

Portraits of Jodhpur's ancestors also grace the walls.\n* Exclusive Use: Unlike some other parts of the fort, Phool Mahal was a private and exclusive chamber, primarily used by the Maharaja for private gatherings, entertainment by female dancers, and as a personal retreat. This exclusivity is reflected in its less accessible location within the fort.\n* Historical Significance: It stands as a testament to the grandeur and artistic patronage of the Rathore rulers of Jodhpur, offering a glimpse into the lavish lifestyle of the royal family.\nToday, Phool Mahal is a key part of the Mehrangarh Fort museum, allowing visitors to step back in time and admire its unique blend of architectural beauty and artistic splendor.",

I must say, it's unbeatable in taste. If you're in Jodhpur or planning a visit, trying their Gulab Jamun is a must. The service is quick, and the Gulab jamun  priced at 500 per kilogram.\nI frequently eat the Gulab Jamun and Rabdi, and I absolutely loved them. The flavors and quality are outstanding.\nOne thing to note is that the entrance is not wheelchair accessible due to small stairs, but it shouldn't be an issue for those who can use stairs. Overall, a delightful sweet shop with top-notch sweets and quick service. Highly recommended for a sweet indulgence in Jodhpur",

Gradually, in the year 1663 by the queen of Maharaja Jaswant Singh I (Hadi Rani Jasrang De), constructed an exquisite lawn and Garden in this area, hence renaming it as \"Raika Bagh\". Later a Place cum Garden Complex was constructed along with Maharaja's Official Guest House, further renaming it as \"Raika Bagh Palace\". It was here that in 1883, Swami Dayanand Saraswati came to Jodhpur. The arrangements for his public audience were made in the public ground of this palace only. He gave his sermons here itself. Even Jaswant Singh used to listen to Swami Dayanand in this palace. But Unfortunately, a tragedy occurred when Swami Dayanand Saraswati was poisoned on 29th September 1883, while being royal guest. It is said it was Dayananda's own cook who conspired with the court dancer to mix crushed Glass in his milk. It is even Rumoured that Queen Zubeida's unsatisfied soul (Second wife of King Hanwant Singh I of Marwar, who died with him in a Mysterious Plane Crash) still  haunts this palace and the royal family's school near the palace.",

            "text": "During my solo trip, I usually prefer walking and using public transport. However, due to the scorching heat in Jodhpur, I decided to book an auto-rickshaw for the entire second day. After visiting the Mandore area and other sites, I asked the driver to head towards Mahamandir Temple. To my surprise, he wasn't familiar with the spot, so I showed him the location on Google Maps.\n\nMahamandir Temple is an ancient and historical site in Jodhpur, but it's not prominently visible from the outside. Interestingly, a government secondary school, primarily for underprivileged children, operates within the complex. The temple was constructed in 1812 under the patronage of the Marwar rulers of Jodhpur.\n\nWhat struck me most about Mahamandir Temple is its design. The temple is renowned for its over 80 intricately sculpted columns, each unique in design and meaning. These pillars support the structure and are adorned with elaborate carvings depicting various aspects of Hindu mythology, nature, and celestial beings. The walls and ceilings are decorated with stunning frescoes, carvings, and sculptures showcasing the artistic brilliance of the artisans.\n\nMany of these sculptures portray scenes from the life of Lord Shiva, his consort Parvati, and other deities from the Hindu pantheon. The artwork also reflects traditional Rajasthani themes, including flora, fauna, and geometric patterns, all etched with remarkable detail.\n\nThe sanctum of the temple, where the main deity Lord Shiva is housed, is a serene and peaceful space. Notably, Shivaratri is grandly celebrated here, along with other related occasions, featuring Rajasthani dance performances and traditional music.\n\nMy driver was thrilled to discover this temple, just like me. He mentioned that he had guided many tourists, including foreign travelers, but was unaware of this temple's existence. He felt sorry for them, saying they might have missed out.\n\nEntry to the temple is officially free, as I had heard earlier. However, an elderly woman asked us for an entry charge of Rs 40 per head. Although the amount might be slightly higher than expected, I gave it to her willingly, understanding that donations or tickets are sometimes necessary to maintain historical and holy sites.\n\nKeywords:  #rajasthan #rajasthantourism #indianheritage #HinduHeritage #jodhpur #jodhpurdiaries #marwari  #temple #templearchitecture #architecture #indiatravelgram #SoloTravel #solo #indian\n\nRajasthan Tourism Rajasthan Tak Indian Solo Trips & Travelers Tourism Department, Government of West Bengal @highlight\n\n©️  Souvik Dasgupta",

The temple was built in 1812 AD by Maharaja Shiv Singh, and it is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple's 84 intricately carved pillars and the detailed sculptures on its walls make it a popular attraction for visitors interested in art, architecture, and religious heritage. However it is now converted into a government school and due to lack of maintenance it is leading to deterioration of the structure and loss of its historical and cultural significance. It's essential for authorities to prioritize the preservation and upkeep of such sites to safeguard their heritage value for the benefit of present and future generations.",

            "text": "The Mahamandir Temple, a 19th-century, beautiful monument built in honor of Lord Shiva, gives visitors an intriguing mix of spiritual peace and architectural grandeur. Constructed during 1812 by Maharaja Shiv Singh, this temple is located roughly 2 kilometers from the city center, a reflection of the artistry, splendor, and religiosity of its era.\nAs soon as they arrive, tourists are awed by the massive structure of the temple, which is made entirely of red sandstone. The walls have exquisitely carved figures of Hindu gods and beautiful traditional Rajasthani designs, depicting the masterful workmanship of that time. The beautiful pictures of Lord Ganesh and Hanuman adorn the main entrance, which opens to a large courtyard that contains shrines to different Hindu gods.\nThe temple's most prominent feature is the assembly hall that is held up by 84 intricately carved pillars. Each pillar is an original work of art, featuring different yogic positions and fascinating stories from Indian mythology. These elaborate sculptures are not only an artistic beauty but also provide insights into the cultural and religious practices of the past. The sanctum sanctorum contains a large black stone lingam, one of the biggest in India, and is well-adorned with paintings and carvings depicting the life and mythology of Lord Shiva.\nThe Mahamandir Temple complex spreads from the principal shrine to include minor temples and a serene garden with a tiny pond, adding to the peaceful environment. Although it is less crowded than some other major temples in Jodhpur, this comparative quiet adds to its peaceful ambiance and makes it a perfect spot for contemplation and prayer.\nFor history, architecture, and religious heritage seekers, the Mahamandir Temple is a travel must. Its beautiful carvings, rich history, and religious importance provide a deep experience, giving a glimpse of Rajasthan's art and culture heritage. To experience it in all its beauty and serenity, visit it in the morning early or late afternoon. Note that recent reports indicate that there is a school on the temple premises, and visits may be limited during school time. It is best to check visiting hours prior to organizing your visit.",
