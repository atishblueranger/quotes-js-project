It stands on a hilltop, rising about 122 m (400 ft) above the surrounding plains, and the complex spans 1,200 acres (486 hectares). It was initially built around 1459 by the Rajput ruler of Rathore clan Rao Jodha,though most of the existing structure is from the 17th century built by his successors. The fort has seven gates, which includes main entrance Jai Pol (meaning 'victory gate'), built by Maharaja Man Singh to commemorate his victories over the Jaipur and Bikaner armies in 1806. The Fattehpol (lit. 'victory gate'), commemorates victory of Maharaja Ajit Singh over the Mughals. The English writer and Nobel Prize winner, Rudyard Kipling, described the fort as \"a palace that might have been built by Titans and colored by the morning sun.\"A beautiful magnificent fort with a magnificent history. Ancient lovely building with multiple floors. For the convenience of tourists a paid lift is installed. It takes you to the top most floor and then you can come down watching museum and temples along the way. Well maintained.\nThere is a museum and 3 to 4 temples inside. You need atleast an hour here. The ticket costs around 200 rupees The fort opens at around 9 am. There is a light & music show too here.\nYou can take a guide too. They are government certified as they say & charge around Rs 400 but you can negotiate to rs 200 to rs 250\nGood place to visit. You feel in awe.\nThere are some decent food outlets outside"

Perched dramatically on a 400-foot-high cliff, this colossal fortress is a masterpiece of architecture, history, and culture that will leave you in awe. From the moment you approach its immense, towering walls, you understand why Rudyard Kipling called it \"the work of giants.\"\n\nThe fort's exterior, carved from burnished red sandstone, seems to merge seamlessly with the rugged hill, creating an image of impregnable strength and natural beauty. But the true magic lies within. The intricately carved palaces, such as the stunning Moti Mahal, Phool Mahal, and Sheesh Mahal, are a testament to the opulence and artistic brilliance of the Rajput rulers. Each courtyard and room tells a story, beautifully preserved and brought to life by the excellent audio guide, which is highly recommended and well worth the minimal cost.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of Mehrangarh is the incredible panoramic view it offers. From the ramparts, you can gaze out over the \"Blue City\" of Jodhpur, a sea of indigo houses that creates a mesmerizing contrast against the arid landscape. The feeling of standing at this vantage point, with the wind carrying the echoes of centuries of history, is simply breathtaking."

They have a toy train service to transport one to the other end of the mandore. The garden premises consists of Cenotaphs, temples, museum, palace, recreation place, large mughal style water fountain and few amenities to cater to the tourists. The entrance fee per person is 40 bucks. The toilets can be much better in cleanliness. The museum inside has a separate entry fee of 20 bucks per head. Overall it will take around 2 to 3 hrs to explore this garden if one is a lover of art and architecture. This place even has a light and sound show in the evening for which one will have to pre book. This is situated at an outskirts of Jodhpur so one will really have to insist the driver to take there. Highly recommended!"

From the moment we arrived at this majestic sandstone marvel, we were transported into a world of regal opulence, impeccable hospitality, and timeless elegance.\n\nThe palace itself is a masterpiece—an architectural wonder blending Indo-Deco style with Rajput grandeur. Set amidst lush gardens and perched high above Jodhpur, the views of the Blue City and the Mehrangarh Fort are absolutely breathtaking.\n\nWhat truly sets Umaid Bhawan apart is the warmth and professionalism of the staff. Every member of the team especially Mr. Gordhan Singh Ji, Mr. Sikander Singh Ji, Mr. Jabar Singh Ji, Mr. Sajjan Singh Ji, Mr. Karan Singh Ji, Mr. Hukum Singh Ji and Mr. Umaid Singh Ji made us feel like royalty. Their attention to detail, genuine smiles, and readiness to go the extra mile made our stay extraordinary.\n\nOur Suite Room was spacious, beautifully furnished, and steeped in history, yet equipped with every modern comfort. The bed was luxurious, the bathroom was grand, and the heritage decor added a unique charm that made us feel like we were living in a bygone era.\n\nDining at the palace was a culinary delight. Each meal at Risala and Pillars was not just delicious, but also beautifully presented, with a menu that honored local Rajasthani flavors while offering international finesse.\n\nWe also thoroughly enjoyed the spa, the vintage car tour, and simply strolling through the manicured gardens. Every corner of the property tells a story, and the history is palpable in the best way.\n\nUmaid Bhawan Palace is more than just a hotel—it’s an experience, a celebration of heritage, and a rare glimpse into a regal lifestyle that most only read about. Whether you're seeking luxury, romance, or cultural richness, this place delivers on every front. We left with hearts full of gratitude and memories to last a lifetime.\n\n5 stars is simply not enough. Highly, highly recommended."

But what really made my stay stand out was the attention to detail -, a complimentary bottle of wine, and a delicious breakfast spread that left me spoiled for choice. The hotel's location was perfect too. If you're looking for a comfortable, luxurious, and genuinely welcoming place to stay, look no further than the this palace.

From the moment we arrived at this majestic sandstone marvel, we were transported into a world of regal opulence, impeccable hospitality, and timeless elegance.\n\nThe palace itself is a masterpiece—an architectural wonder blending Indo-Deco style with Rajput grandeur. Set amidst lush gardens and perched high above Jodhpur, the views of the Blue City and the Mehrangarh Fort are absolutely breathtaking.\n\nWhat truly sets Umaid Bhawan apart is the warmth and professionalism of the staff. Every member of the team especially Mr. Gordhan Singh Ji, Mr. Sikander Singh Ji, Mr. Jabar Singh Ji, Mr. Sajjan Singh Ji, Mr. Karan Singh Ji, Mr. Hukum Singh Ji and Mr. Umaid Singh Ji made us feel like royalty. Their attention to detail, genuine smiles, and readiness to go the extra mile made our stay extraordinary.\n\nOur Suite Room was spacious, beautifully furnished, and steeped in history, yet equipped with every modern comfort. The bed was luxurious, the bathroom was grand, and the heritage decor added a unique charm that made us feel like we were living in a bygone era.\n\nDining at the palace was a culinary delight. Each meal at Risala and Pillars was not just delicious, but also beautifully presented, with a menu that honored local Rajasthani flavors while offering international finesse.\n\nWe also thoroughly enjoyed the spa, the vintage car tour, and simply strolling through the manicured gardens. Every corner of the property tells a story, and the history is palpable in the best way.\n\nUmaid Bhawan Palace is more than just a hotel—it’s an experience, a celebration of heritage, and a rare glimpse into a regal lifestyle that most only read about. Whether you're seeking luxury, romance, or cultural richness, this place delivers on every front. We left with hearts full of gratitude and memories to last a lifetime.\n\n5 stars is simply not enough. Highly, highly recommended."

The name \"Phool Mahal\" itself suggests its vibrant beauty, as its interiors are designed to evoke the essence of a blooming flower.\nHere's what makes it so remarkable:\n* Opulent Decor: The palace is renowned for its extravagant decoration, featuring intricate frescoes, elaborate carvings, and richly colored wall paintings. The walls and ceilings are adorned with gold leaf work, often using gold brought from Gujarat, creating a lavish and regal ambiance.\n* Artistic Excellence: You'll find a stunning display of Rajput and Mughal artistry, including detailed mirror work, delicate filigree, and vivid murals depicting royal life, traditional motifs, and even illustrations from the famous Raga Mala series (Indian classical music compositions). Portraits of Jodhpur's ancestors also grace the walls.\n* Exclusive Use: Unlike some other parts of the fort, Phool Mahal was a private and exclusive chamber, primarily used by the Maharaja for private gatherings, entertainment by female dancers, and as a personal retreat. This exclusivity is reflected in its less accessible location within the fort.\n* Historical Significance: It stands as a testament to the grandeur and artistic patronage of the Rathore rulers of Jodhpur, offering a glimpse into the lavish lifestyle of the royal family.\nToday, Phool Mahal is a key part of the Mehrangarh Fort museum, allowing visitors to step back in time and admire its unique blend of architectural beauty and artistic splendor."

The hall probably served the purpose of a pleasure dome of the Maharajas, and the female dancers used to stay here. Accordingly the room was made to look as beautiful as a magnificent flower, which earned it the name Phool mahal. The ceiling has golden filigree work, for which it is said, gold was brought from Ahmedabad, Gujarat. There are also some beautiful portraits and paintings, especially the raga mala series, and furniture from the British period to enhance the glory of the room."

The Palace was once an area which housed \"Raika Community\" and their camels. Gradually, in the year 1663 by the queen of Maharaja Jaswant Singh I (Hadi Rani Jasrang De), constructed an exquisite lawn and Garden in this area, hence renaming it as \"Raika Bagh\". Later a Place cum Garden Complex was constructed along with Maharaja's Official Guest House, further renaming it as \"Raika Bagh Palace\". It was here that in 1883, Swami Dayanand Saraswati came to Jodhpur. The arrangements for his public audience were made in the public ground of this palace only. He gave his sermons here itself. Even Jaswant Singh used to listen to Swami Dayanand in this palace. But Unfortunately, a tragedy occurred when Swami Dayanand Saraswati was poisoned on 29th September 1883, while being royal guest. It is said it was Dayananda’s own cook who conspired with the court dancer to mix crushed Glass in his milk. It is even Rumoured that Queen Zubeida's unsatisfied soul (Second wife of King Hanwant Singh I of Marwar, who died with him in a Mysterious Plane Crash) still  haunts this palace and the royal family's school near the palace."

Highly recommend this tour for anyone looking for an unforgettable desert adventure with top-notch hospitality.\n\nAdditionally, we were touched by the extended care provided by Sumer’s dad, who ensured our car parked a little away from their house was safe and secure. It truly exemplified their commitment to hospitality and guest satisfaction. Very humble family, and Sumer’s vision of providing free education to kids in his village is a very selfless vision.

The pick up from our hotel (Radisson) was in a quality SUV and the trip upto the Osian desert outskirts was smooth. We also visited the Sacchiyay Mata temple which offered some lovely prayer and ancient architecture. We were met by Samer and the jeep safari that followed through the Osian sand shrubbery and desert outskirts was quite a thrilling experience and could spot some antelope and peacocks. We reached his quaint village and he has a lovely homestay as well. Meeting his family and his own farm camels and goats and talking with the lovely man was a nice experience. My gf (from Thailand) felt at home as she cooked with Samers mom in the traditional village kitchen and we really enjoyed the lovely home cooked meal as well. It was also heartwarming to see his voluntary enterprise to teach his village children English and Computers and meeting the kids was a highlight. And then to end the trip with our lovely camels, Mr. Jigar and Michael Jackson was just stunning in the sunset. The camels are well trained and gentle animals .. the ride very comfortable and fun at the same time ... the location itself through the camel ride just breathtaking. All in all, I would highly recommend this away from the rush and such an earthly and true village experience as you get to interact with the real flavors of the rajasthan and it's beautiful culture. The ride back to our hotel in the car was also well taken care of and our hosts were lovely, polite and extremely hospitable. A 5/5 for a real and truly deeper experience of the camels and culture of rajasthan."

We were welcomed to their small village and shared a delicious meal in their family home. We were amazed at their hospitality and inspired by the local school/education lessons they have set up for children within their home. They use a portion of their family income to fund the education lessons for small children in their village. We wished we stayed for the home stay. We definitely recommend!!"

We got tasty traditional food and even could help a bit in the kitchen. In the night we decided to sleep under the stars, but could have stayed in the hut as well. The hut was very new and the bathroom big and clean."

He wishes to bring development to his village through his business and I would contribute to that by visiting him again. Sumer is very open to feedback and genuinely tries to improve the guest experience. The funniest and the best part was him running with the camels to click excellent photographs. I wish him luck!"

Mr. Sumer, our host, took so many high-quality photos for us.)\n\nAt night, the host mother cooked traditional dinner for us. We could also try to make chapati. After dinner, the beds were prepared outside of our room, and we were lying down and sleeping under millions of stars.\nThe shower room was just renewed, so it was very clean and comfortable.\n\nI strongly recommend you to stay here. You will definitely get a memorable experience in your journey."

Then Mr.Sumer took us on camel ride of 30-40min to his village home stay and as we entered they welcomed us by offering traditional राजस्थानी पगडी to wear. Post that we checked the Hut rooms and we were Awestruck by noticing the clean room and specially western washroom.Then Sumer explained instead of making more huts for tourist he invested that money in opening a FREE computer class in his house for villages kids to learn typing and English which was so Inspiring and motivating for us. Later Sumer's mother served us ultimately tasty Rajasthani food and chaay!(mirchi ki chutney was the best).The whole family was very humble in nature and they provided us with great service. Lastly we took jeep safari to our car location. This was one of the best experience we had in our trip to Rajasthan."

Umaid bhavan is partly open for the public as the royal family stays in the remaining part. The Guide informed that this palace was built during the famine in the 1920s when the then Maharaja Umaid Singh offered the people food for their work so that people would not sleep without food. People worked in building the palace and in lieu of it they received food. Construction work started in 1929 and was completed in 1943. The museum opens at 10 am and closes at 5 pm on all the days of the week. So one has to reach at least before 3 pm to visit this museum completely."

Part of it is still the royal residence, another section is a luxury Taj hotel, and one wing houses a museum open to the public.

The palace gardens are beautifully maintained and perfect for photography.\n\n✔️ Highlights:\n\nBeautiful Indo-Deco architecture\n\nMuseum with artifacts & vintage cars 🚗\n\nTaj Palace hotel experience (for those who stay/dine)\n\nGreat panoramic views of the Blue City\n\n⚠️ Tips:\n\nMuseum is closed on certain holidays – check timings before visiting.\n\nVisit in the morning or late afternoon for best light.\n\nEntry ticket is affordable, but hotel dining/stay is premium.\n\nUmaid Bhavan is not just a palace – it’s a symbol of Jodhpur’s royal legacy, combining history, luxury, and elegance.

The Stambha itself is covered with very beautiful sculptures. It's really very beautiful if you see these particularly. A must place to visit during Chittorgarh Fort Visit."

While the rooms were small but clean, the amenities left much to be desired. The rooms lacked basic essentials like toilet paper, slippers, shaving kits, and handwash. Furthermore, no drinking water was provided, which is quite unacceptable.\n\nAdditionally, there was a lot of noise from the lift mechanism throughout the night, which was very disturbing and made it difficult to sleep.\n\nConsidering the price being asked at ₹2200 per night, it is definitely not worth it. In my opinion, the maximum value for this hotel should be between ₹1000 to ₹1200 per night. After a lot of negotiations, I managed to pay ₹1800, as I was tired and didn’t want to explore other options.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed with the lack of amenities, the high price for what was offered, and the constant noise. I would not recommend staying here unless there are significant improvements."

              "reviewText": "Jodhpur is a city located in the state of Rajasthan in northern India, with a population of 1.03 million (2011). The old part of the city is surrounded by an impressive 9.5 km long wall with 101 bastions and seven gates. The city is renowned for its richly carved stone buildings, especially the red sandstone houses in Sadar Basar and the temple in Dhan Market (the grain market). The newer part of the city outside the wall also features notable buildings, particularly the Umaid Bhawan Palace with its 347 rooms, built between 1929 and 1944, considered a prime example of Indian Art Deco architecture.\n\nMehrangarh Fort, situated on a 125-meter high rock in the old city, dominates the city's skyline. The fort, now a museum, contains several palaces.\n\nApproximately 200 meters northwest of the fort on a plateau lies Jaswant Thada, a memorial to Maharaja Jaswant Singh, built in white marble in 1899.\n\nJodhpur is also known for its small-scale industries and crafts, including textile production, dyeing, leatherwork, metal tools, bicycles, marble work, and carpet weaving. The city is home to an important base for the Indian Air Force.\n\nJodhpur is often referred to as the \"Blue City\" because many of its houses are painted blue. Originally, the blue color signified that the house was inhabited by a Brahmin.\n\nThe city was founded in 1459 by the Rajput ruler Rao Jodha on the trade route between Delhi and Gujarat, which facilitated its rapid growth. Rao Jodha conquered much of the surrounding area and established the princely state of Marwar, which came under the Mughal Empire in 1561. During the 18th century, as Mughal power waned, Marwar fell under Maratha control. In 1818, Marwar came under British rule, and Jodhpur became part of Rajasthan in 1949."

Toorji Ka Jhalra Bavdi is an 18th century stepwell built by a queen.\nOnce a community water source is now a hangout place. Sitting on the steps are quite relaxing or can can climb down to the last step to touch the water. The water needs to be cleaned regularly. We saw a pre wedding photo shoot at the venue too.\nPlease mark this spot if you are visiting Jodhpur and you don't have to pay an entry fee for this place."

From the moment we arrived at this majestic sandstone marvel, we were transported into a world of regal opulence, impeccable hospitality, and timeless elegance.\n\nThe palace itself is a masterpiece—an architectural wonder blending Indo-Deco style with Rajput grandeur. Set amidst lush gardens and perched high above Jodhpur, the views of the Blue City and the Mehrangarh Fort are absolutely breathtaking.\n\nWhat truly sets Umaid Bhawan apart is the warmth and professionalism of the staff. Every member of the team especially Mr. Gordhan Singh Ji, Mr. Sikander Singh Ji, Mr. Jabar Singh Ji, Mr. Sajjan Singh Ji, Mr. Karan Singh Ji, Mr. Hukum Singh Ji and Mr. Umaid Singh Ji made us feel like royalty. Their attention to detail, genuine smiles, and readiness to go the extra mile made our stay extraordinary.\n\nOur Suite Room was spacious, beautifully furnished, and steeped in history, yet equipped with every modern comfort. The bed was luxurious, the bathroom was grand, and the heritage decor added a unique charm that made us feel like we were living in a bygone era.\n\nDining at the palace was a culinary delight. Each meal at Risala and Pillars was not just delicious, but also beautifully presented, with a menu that honored local Rajasthani flavors while offering international finesse.\n\nWe also thoroughly enjoyed the spa, the vintage car tour, and simply strolling through the manicured gardens. Every corner of the property tells a story, and the history is palpable in the best way.\n\nUmaid Bhawan Palace is more than just a hotel—it’s an experience, a celebration of heritage, and a rare glimpse into a regal lifestyle that most only read about. Whether you're seeking luxury, romance, or cultural richness, this place delivers on every front. We left with hearts full of gratitude and memories to last a lifetime.\n\n5 stars is simply not enough. Highly, highly recommended."

You can visit Jaswant Thada then visit this place\n5. Ticket prices are - 200rs, Use ticket counter 2, usually I found it less crowded."

A lift service is available (₹50 one-way) that takes you up to the higher levels of the fort, saving time and effort. From there, you still need to explore some sections on foot, especially to see the Diwan-e-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) and  Diwan-e-Khas (Hall of Private Audience).\nOne of the highlights of the fort is the breathtaking view of the Blue City of Jodhpur, best enjoyed from the top floors where the old cannons are placed. The panoramic view is truly mesmerizing, especially in the evening light.\nIt is highly recommended to hire a local guide. ( Rs.400 for 4 people )They explain the rich history, legends, and architectural details that you might otherwise miss. The fort also houses a well-maintained museum, which displays royal artifacts such as ancient swords, armory, traditional costumes, miniature paintings, palanquins, elephant seats (howdahs), and other treasures of Rajasthan’s royal heritage.\nMehrangarh is a must-visit attraction in Jodhpur, but do keep in mind that the fort is vast and requires time to explore properly. Plan to spend at least\n2–3 hours here to cover the main sections comfortably.\nIf you have more time, you can also enjoy cultural performances and traditional music often held in the fort courtyard, which add to the royal experience."

It stands on a hilltop, rising about 122 m (400 ft) above the surrounding plains, and the complex spans 1,200 acres (486 hectares). It was initially built around 1459 by the Rajput ruler of Rathore clan Rao Jodha,though most of the existing structure is from the 17th century built by his successors. The fort has seven gates, which includes main entrance Jai Pol (meaning 'victory gate'), built by Maharaja Man Singh to commemorate his victories over the Jaipur and Bikaner armies in 1806. The Fattehpol (lit. 'victory gate'), commemorates victory of Maharaja Ajit Singh over the Mughals. The English writer and Nobel Prize winner, Rudyard Kipling, described the fort as \"a palace that might have been built by Titans and colored by the morning sun.\"A beautiful magnificent fort with a magnificent history. Ancient lovely building with multiple floors. For the convenience of tourists a paid lift is installed. It takes you to the top most floor and then you can come down watching museum and temples along the way. Well maintained.\nThere is a museum and 3 to 4 temples inside. You need atleast an hour here. The ticket costs around 200 rupees The fort opens at around 9 am. There is a light & music show too here.\nYou can take a guide too. They are government certified as they say & charge around Rs 400 but you can negotiate to rs 200 to rs 250\nGood place to visit. You feel in awe.\nThere are some decent food outlets outside"

Perched dramatically on a 400-foot-high cliff, this colossal fortress is a masterpiece of architecture, history, and culture that will leave you in awe. From the moment you approach its immense, towering walls, you understand why Rudyard Kipling called it \"the work of giants.\"\n\nThe fort's exterior, carved from burnished red sandstone, seems to merge seamlessly with the rugged hill, creating an image of impregnable strength and natural beauty. But the true magic lies within. The intricately carved palaces, such as the stunning Moti Mahal, Phool Mahal, and Sheesh Mahal, are a testament to the opulence and artistic brilliance of the Rajput rulers. Each courtyard and room tells a story, beautifully preserved and brought to life by the excellent audio guide, which is highly recommended and well worth the minimal cost.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of Mehrangarh is the incredible panoramic view it offers. From the ramparts, you can gaze out over the \"Blue City\" of Jodhpur, a sea of indigo houses that creates a mesmerizing contrast against the arid landscape. The feeling of standing at this vantage point, with the wind carrying the echoes of centuries of history, is simply breathtaking."

              "reviewText": "Mandore Garden is truly one of the hidden gem of Jodhpur. This garden is is big and have lots of things to do within the premises. They have a toy train service to transport one to the other end of the mandore. The garden premises consists of Cenotaphs, temples, museum, palace, recreation place, large mughal style water fountain and few amenities to cater to the tourists. The entrance fee per person is 40 bucks. The toilets can be much better in cleanliness. The museum inside has a separate entry fee of 20 bucks per head. Overall it will take around 2 to 3 hrs to explore this garden if one is a lover of art and architecture. This place even has a light and sound show in the evening for which one will have to pre book. This is situated at an outskirts of Jodhpur so one will really have to insist the driver to take there. Highly recommended!"

It is known for its ancient cenotaphs (chhatris) of Marwar rulers, temples, and the lush green garden that makes it a calm escape from the busy city. The architecture here is unique – tall red sandstone structures with intricate carvings that reflect the grandeur of Rajputana heritage.\n\nThe garden is also home to a museum, statues of deities and local heroes, and lots of monkeys roaming around, which adds a lively touch. It’s a good place for history lovers, photographers, and families looking for a relaxed outing.\n\n✔️ Highlights:\n\nCenotaphs of Rathore rulers\n\nHall of Heroes & museum\n\nPeaceful gardens and greenery\n\nGood spot for photography\n\n⚠️ Tips:\n\nBest visited in the morning or evening to avoid heat.\n\nEntry is free, but keep small cash for museum tickets.\n\nBe careful with food items due to monkeys.\n\nMandore Garden may not be as grand as Mehrangarh Fort, but it has its own charm – a blend of history, culture, and nature worth experiencing when in Jodhpur."

However, due to the scorching heat in Jodhpur, I decided to book an auto-rickshaw for the entire second day. After visiting the Mandore area and other sites, I asked the driver to head towards Mahamandir Temple. To my surprise, he wasn't familiar with the spot, so I showed him the location on Google Maps.\n\nMahamandir Temple is an ancient and historical site in Jodhpur, but it's not prominently visible from the outside. Interestingly, a government secondary school, primarily for underprivileged children, operates within the complex. The temple was constructed in 1812 under the patronage of the Marwar rulers of Jodhpur.\n\nWhat struck me most about Mahamandir Temple is its design. The temple is renowned for its over 80 intricately sculpted columns, each unique in design and meaning. These pillars support the structure and are adorned with elaborate carvings depicting various aspects of Hindu mythology, nature, and celestial beings. The walls and ceilings are decorated with stunning frescoes, carvings, and sculptures showcasing the artistic brilliance of the artisans.\n\nMany of these sculptures portray scenes from the life of Lord Shiva, his consort Parvati, and other deities from the Hindu pantheon. The artwork also reflects traditional Rajasthani themes, including flora, fauna, and geometric patterns, all etched with remarkable detail.\n\nThe sanctum of the temple, where the main deity Lord Shiva is housed, is a serene and peaceful space. Notably, Shivaratri is grandly celebrated here, along with other related occasions, featuring Rajasthani dance performances and traditional music.\n\nMy driver was thrilled to discover this temple, just like me. He mentioned that he had guided many tourists, including foreign travelers, but was unaware of this temple's existence. He felt sorry for them, saying they might have missed out.\n\nEntry to the temple is officially free, as I had heard earlier. However, an elderly woman asked us for an entry charge of Rs 40 per head. Although the amount might be slightly higher than expected, I gave it to her willingly, understanding that donations or tickets are sometimes necessary to maintain historical and holy sites.\n\nKeywords:  #rajasthan #rajasthantourism #indianheritage #HinduHeritage #jodhpur #jodhpurdiaries #marwari  #temple #templearchitecture #architecture #indiatravelgram #SoloTravel #solo #indian\n\nRajasthan Tourism Rajasthan Tak Indian Solo Trips & Travelers Tourism Department, Government of West Bengal @highlight\n\n©️  Souvik Dasgupta"

              "reviewText": "The Mahamandir Temple is a beautiful Hindu temple located in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, India. It is renowned for its intricate architecture and exquisite stone carvings. The temple was built in 1812 AD by Maharaja Shiv Singh, and it is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple's 84 intricately carved pillars and the detailed sculptures on its walls make it a popular attraction for visitors interested in art, architecture, and religious heritage. However it is now converted into a government school and due to lack of maintenance it is leading to deterioration of the structure and loss of its historical and cultural significance. It's essential for authorities to prioritize the preservation and upkeep of such sites to safeguard their heritage value for the benefit of present and future generations."

              "reviewText": "The Mahamandir Temple, a 19th-century, beautiful monument built in honor of Lord Shiva, gives visitors an intriguing mix of spiritual peace and architectural grandeur. Constructed during 1812 by Maharaja Shiv Singh, this temple is located roughly 2 kilometers from the city center, a reflection of the artistry, splendor, and religiosity of its era.\nAs soon as they arrive, tourists are awed by the massive structure of the temple, which is made entirely of red sandstone. The walls have exquisitely carved figures of Hindu gods and beautiful traditional Rajasthani designs, depicting the masterful workmanship of that time. The beautiful pictures of Lord Ganesh and Hanuman adorn the main entrance, which opens to a large courtyard that contains shrines to different Hindu gods.\nThe temple's most prominent feature is the assembly hall that is held up by 84 intricately carved pillars. Each pillar is an original work of art, featuring different yogic positions and fascinating stories from Indian mythology. These elaborate sculptures are not only an artistic beauty but also provide insights into the cultural and religious practices of the past. The sanctum sanctorum contains a large black stone lingam, one of the biggest in India, and is well-adorned with paintings and carvings depicting the life and mythology of Lord Shiva.\nThe Mahamandir Temple complex spreads from the principal shrine to include minor temples and a serene garden with a tiny pond, adding to the peaceful environment. Although it is less crowded than some other major temples in Jodhpur, this comparative quiet adds to its peaceful ambiance and makes it a perfect spot for contemplation and prayer.\nFor history, architecture, and religious heritage seekers, the Mahamandir Temple is a travel must. Its beautiful carvings, rich history, and religious importance provide a deep experience, giving a glimpse of Rajasthan's art and culture heritage. To experience it in all its beauty and serenity, visit it in the morning early or late afternoon. Note that recent reports indicate that there is a school on the temple premises, and visits may be limited during school time. It is best to check visiting hours prior to organizing your visit."

Umaid bhavan is partly open for the public as the royal family stays in the remaining part. The Guide informed that this palace was built during the famine in the 1920s when the then Maharaja Umaid Singh offered the people food for their work so that people would not sleep without food. People worked in building the palace and in lieu of it they received food. Construction work started in 1929 and was completed in 1943. The museum opens at 10 am and closes at 5 pm on all the days of the week. So one has to reach at least before 3 pm to visit this museum completely."

The Palace was once an area which housed \"Raika Community\" and their camels. Gradually, in the year 1663 by the queen of Maharaja Jaswant Singh I (Hadi Rani Jasrang De), constructed an exquisite lawn and Garden in this area, hence renaming it as \"Raika Bagh\". Later a Place cum Garden Complex was constructed along with Maharaja's Official Guest House, further renaming it as \"Raika Bagh Palace\". It was here that in 1883, Swami Dayanand Saraswati came to Jodhpur. The arrangements for his public audience were made in the public ground of this palace only. He gave his sermons here itself. Even Jaswant Singh used to listen to Swami Dayanand in this palace. But Unfortunately, a tragedy occurred when Swami Dayanand Saraswati was poisoned on 29th September 1883, while being royal guest. It is said it was Dayananda’s own cook who conspired with the court dancer to mix crushed Glass in his milk. It is even Rumoured that Queen Zubeida's unsatisfied soul (Second wife of King Hanwant Singh I of Marwar, who died with him in a Mysterious Plane Crash) still  haunts this palace and the royal family's school near the palace."

Walls are one step away from the trails.\nYou can conveniently choose between different trails according to duration, length and sun exposure."

The lake is surrounded by lush green gardens that house groves of trees like mango, papaya, pomegranate, guava and plum. Animals and birds like the jackal and peacock also call this place home.\nBalsamand Lake is an artificial lake that was built way back in 1159 AD by Balak Rao Parihar as a water reservoir to cater for Mandore. One kilometre long, 50 m broad and 15 m deep; the lake is located in the middle of a manicured garden full of mango, papaya, pomegranate, guava and plum trees. Jackal and peacock are the prominent guests in the garden. There is an impressive red sandstone summer palace on the shores of the lake, which is now converted into a five-star property.

Standing near the clock tower you can imagine how well planned the cities would be in ancient times."

It’s located right in the center of Sardar Market and serves as a prominent landmark.\n\nI’ve been visiting this area for over 10 years since my first trip, but unfortunately the dusty conditions remain unchanged. Every time a rickshaw passes by, clouds of dust still kick up from the unpaved roads, which can be quite uncomfortable.\n\nWhile it’s possible to enter the clock tower itself, I didn’t find much merit in going inside, so I chose to skip visiting inside. The tower is impressive enough from the outside and worth seeing as part of exploring the bustling Sardar Market."

Very crowded place during evening and weekends. Lots of famous eateries are there, you can enjoy many famous dishes of Jodhpur in the area. Don't come here by own car as finding parking is almost impossible. The Clock Tower also called Ghanta Ghar looks beautiful during night. We can go up the tower as well (up to a certain point) by taking a ticket of minimal price."

The name \"Phool Mahal\" itself suggests its vibrant beauty, as its interiors are designed to evoke the essence of a blooming flower.\nHere's what makes it so remarkable:\n* Opulent Decor: The palace is renowned for its extravagant decoration, featuring intricate frescoes, elaborate carvings, and richly colored wall paintings. The walls and ceilings are adorned with gold leaf work, often using gold brought from Gujarat, creating a lavish and regal ambiance.\n* Artistic Excellence: You'll find a stunning display of Rajput and Mughal artistry, including detailed mirror work, delicate filigree, and vivid murals depicting royal life, traditional motifs, and even illustrations from the famous Raga Mala series (Indian classical music compositions). Portraits of Jodhpur's ancestors also grace the walls.\n* Exclusive Use: Unlike some other parts of the fort, Phool Mahal was a private and exclusive chamber, primarily used by the Maharaja for private gatherings, entertainment by female dancers, and as a personal retreat. This exclusivity is reflected in its less accessible location within the fort.\n* Historical Significance: It stands as a testament to the grandeur and artistic patronage of the Rathore rulers of Jodhpur, offering a glimpse into the lavish lifestyle of the royal family.\nToday, Phool Mahal is a key part of the Mehrangarh Fort museum, allowing visitors to step back in time and admire its unique blend of architectural beauty and artistic splendor."

I must say, it's unbeatable in taste. If you're in Jodhpur or planning a visit, trying their Gulab Jamun is a must. The service is quick, and the Gulab jamun  priced at 500 per kilogram.\nI frequently eat the Gulab Jamun and Rabdi, and I absolutely loved them. The flavors and quality are outstanding.\nOne thing to note is that the entrance is not wheelchair accessible due to small stairs, but it shouldn't be an issue for those who can use stairs. Overall, a delightful sweet shop with top-notch sweets and quick service. Highly recommended for a sweet indulgence in Jodhpur"

They have a toy train service to transport one to the other end of the mandore. The garden premises consists of Cenotaphs, temples, museum, palace, recreation place, large mughal style water fountain and few amenities to cater to the tourists. The entrance fee per person is 40 bucks. The toilets can be much better in cleanliness. The museum inside has a separate entry fee of 20 bucks per head. Overall it will take around 2 to 3 hrs to explore this garden if one is a lover of art and architecture. This place even has a light and sound show in the evening for which one will have to pre book. This is situated at an outskirts of Jodhpur so one will really have to insist the driver to take there. Highly recommended!"

              "reviewText": "Mandore Garden is a beautiful historic site located a few kilometers from Jodhpur city. It is known for its ancient cenotaphs (chhatris) of Marwar rulers, temples, and the lush green garden that makes it a calm escape from the busy city. The architecture here is unique – tall red sandstone structures with intricate carvings that reflect the grandeur of Rajputana heritage.\n\nThe garden is also home to a museum, statues of deities and local heroes, and lots of monkeys roaming around, which adds a lively touch. It’s a good place for history lovers, photographers, and families looking for a relaxed outing.\n\n✔️ Highlights:\n\nCenotaphs of Rathore rulers\n\nHall of Heroes & museum\n\nPeaceful gardens and greenery\n\nGood spot for photography\n\n⚠️ Tips:\n\nBest visited in the morning or evening to avoid heat.\n\nEntry is free, but keep small cash for museum tickets.\n\nBe careful with food items due to monkeys.\n\nMandore Garden may not be as grand as Mehrangarh Fort, but it has its own charm – a blend of history, culture, and nature worth experiencing when in Jodhpur."

The place is surrounded by many good restaurants, handicrafts and clothing shop. Can be reached easily. Many movies shooting took place here, From here you can see the fort.

Toorji Ka Jhalra Bavdi is an 18th century stepwell built by a queen.\nOnce a community water source is now a hangout place. Sitting on the steps are quite relaxing or can can climb down to the last step to touch the water. The water needs to be cleaned regularly. We saw a pre wedding photo shoot at the venue too.\nPlease mark this spot if you are visiting Jodhpur and you don't have to pay an entry fee for this place."

You can visit Jaswant Thada then visit this place\n5. Ticket prices are - 200rs, Use ticket counter 2, usually I found it less crowded."

A lift service is available (₹50 one-way) that takes you up to the higher levels of the fort, saving time and effort. From there, you still need to explore some sections on foot, especially to see the Diwan-e-Aam (Hall of Public Audience) and  Diwan-e-Khas (Hall of Private Audience).\nOne of the highlights of the fort is the breathtaking view of the Blue City of Jodhpur, best enjoyed from the top floors where the old cannons are placed. The panoramic view is truly mesmerizing, especially in the evening light.\nIt is highly recommended to hire a local guide. ( Rs.400 for 4 people )They explain the rich history, legends, and architectural details that you might otherwise miss. The fort also houses a well-maintained museum, which displays royal artifacts such as ancient swords, armory, traditional costumes, miniature paintings, palanquins, elephant seats (howdahs), and other treasures of Rajasthan’s royal heritage.\nMehrangarh is a must-visit attraction in Jodhpur, but do keep in mind that the fort is vast and requires time to explore properly. Plan to spend at least\n2–3 hours here to cover the main sections comfortably.\nIf you have more time, you can also enjoy cultural performances and traditional music often held in the fort courtyard, which add to the royal experience."

It stands on a hilltop, rising about 122 m (400 ft) above the surrounding plains, and the complex spans 1,200 acres (486 hectares). It was initially built around 1459 by the Rajput ruler of Rathore clan Rao Jodha,though most of the existing structure is from the 17th century built by his successors. The fort has seven gates, which includes main entrance Jai Pol (meaning 'victory gate'), built by Maharaja Man Singh to commemorate his victories over the Jaipur and Bikaner armies in 1806. The Fattehpol (lit. 'victory gate'), commemorates victory of Maharaja Ajit Singh over the Mughals. The English writer and Nobel Prize winner, Rudyard Kipling, described the fort as \"a palace that might have been built by Titans and colored by the morning sun.\"A beautiful magnificent fort with a magnificent history. Ancient lovely building with multiple floors. For the convenience of tourists a paid lift is installed. It takes you to the top most floor and then you can come down watching museum and temples along the way. Well maintained.\nThere is a museum and 3 to 4 temples inside. You need atleast an hour here. The ticket costs around 200 rupees The fort opens at around 9 am. There is a light & music show too here.\nYou can take a guide too. They are government certified as they say & charge around Rs 400 but you can negotiate to rs 200 to rs 250\nGood place to visit. You feel in awe.\nThere are some decent food outlets outside"

Perched dramatically on a 400-foot-high cliff, this colossal fortress is a masterpiece of architecture, history, and culture that will leave you in awe. From the moment you approach its immense, towering walls, you understand why Rudyard Kipling called it \"the work of giants.\"\n\nThe fort's exterior, carved from burnished red sandstone, seems to merge seamlessly with the rugged hill, creating an image of impregnable strength and natural beauty. But the true magic lies within. The intricately carved palaces, such as the stunning Moti Mahal, Phool Mahal, and Sheesh Mahal, are a testament to the opulence and artistic brilliance of the Rajput rulers. Each courtyard and room tells a story, beautifully preserved and brought to life by the excellent audio guide, which is highly recommended and well worth the minimal cost.\n\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of Mehrangarh is the incredible panoramic view it offers. From the ramparts, you can gaze out over the \"Blue City\" of Jodhpur, a sea of indigo houses that creates a mesmerizing contrast against the arid landscape. The feeling of standing at this vantage point, with the wind carrying the echoes of centuries of history, is simply breathtaking."

From the moment we arrived at this majestic sandstone marvel, we were transported into a world of regal opulence, impeccable hospitality, and timeless elegance.\n\nThe palace itself is a masterpiece—an architectural wonder blending Indo-Deco style with Rajput grandeur. Set amidst lush gardens and perched high above Jodhpur, the views of the Blue City and the Mehrangarh Fort are absolutely breathtaking.\n\nWhat truly sets Umaid Bhawan apart is the warmth and professionalism of the staff. Every member of the team especially Mr. Gordhan Singh Ji, Mr. Sikander Singh Ji, Mr. Jabar Singh Ji, Mr. Sajjan Singh Ji, Mr. Karan Singh Ji, Mr. Hukum Singh Ji and Mr. Umaid Singh Ji made us feel like royalty. Their attention to detail, genuine smiles, and readiness to go the extra mile made our stay extraordinary.\n\nOur Suite Room was spacious, beautifully furnished, and steeped in history, yet equipped with every modern comfort. The bed was luxurious, the bathroom was grand, and the heritage decor added a unique charm that made us feel like we were living in a bygone era.\n\nDining at the palace was a culinary delight. Each meal at Risala and Pillars was not just delicious, but also beautifully presented, with a menu that honored local Rajasthani flavors while offering international finesse.\n\nWe also thoroughly enjoyed the spa, the vintage car tour, and simply strolling through the manicured gardens. Every corner of the property tells a story, and the history is palpable in the best way.\n\nUmaid Bhawan Palace is more than just a hotel—it’s an experience, a celebration of heritage, and a rare glimpse into a regal lifestyle that most only read about. Whether you're seeking luxury, romance, or cultural richness, this place delivers on every front. We left with hearts full of gratitude and memories to last a lifetime.\n\n5 stars is simply not enough. Highly, highly recommended."

              "reviewText": "Kaylana Lake, a serene man‑made oasis just 8 km west of Jodhpur, was built in 1872 by Maharaja Pratap Singh to alleviate water scarcity  . Covering about 0.84 km² and reaching depths of 35–50 ft, it sits nestled among rugged rock formations and babool trees, creating a striking contrast against the desert backdrop  .\n\nVisitors often praise the lake for its peaceful ambiance and natural beauty. In winter (October–March), it transforms into a paradise for bird watchers, welcoming migratory species like Siberian cranes, pelicans, herons, and flamingos  . Early mornings and evenings offer the best light, turning the water into a reflective canvas at sunrise and sunset  .\n\nRecreational options are plentiful—boating is popular, with paddle, motor, and speed boats available (from around ₹120–₹250)  . Nature walks, trekking to a nearby Shiv Mandir, cycling, and picnicking by the shore add to the charm  .\n\nDespite its appeal, amenities are sparse. Visitors note limited facilities—restrooms can be locked or inaccessible, and there's a shortage of food stalls  . So pack essentials like water and snacks. Entry is free, and the lake is accessible daily, best enjoyed from 9 AM to 5 PM  .\n\nOverall, Kaylana Lake is a peaceful retreat—ideal for a 2–3‑hour stop. It’s especially lovely during winter and monsoon when migratory birds take centre stage. Just don’t expect luxury—come for the calm, wildlife sightings, and scenic views of Jodhpur’s desert landscape."

It’s located right in the center of Sardar Market and serves as a prominent landmark.\n\nI’ve been visiting this area for over 10 years since my first trip, but unfortunately the dusty conditions remain unchanged. Every time a rickshaw passes by, clouds of dust still kick up from the unpaved roads, which can be quite uncomfortable.\n\nWhile it’s possible to enter the clock tower itself, I didn’t find much merit in going inside, so I chose to skip visiting inside. The tower is impressive enough from the outside and worth seeing as part of exploring the bustling Sardar Market."

But what really made my stay stand out was the attention to detail -, a complimentary bottle of wine, and a delicious breakfast spread that left me spoiled for choice. The hotel's location was perfect too. If you're looking for a comfortable, luxurious, and genuinely welcoming place to stay, look no further than the this palace. I'll be back for sure!\"\n\nSometime a room becomes so subtle that it hangs on a threat to be called as boring.  Felt the need of air conditioning at certain places but since, it’s a heritage property I understand that.  Morning, cold buffet was fine.  Overall, a good stay and there is everything for everyone."

From the moment we arrived at this majestic sandstone marvel, we were transported into a world of regal opulence, impeccable hospitality, and timeless elegance.\n\nThe palace itself is a masterpiece—an architectural wonder blending Indo-Deco style with Rajput grandeur. Set amidst lush gardens and perched high above Jodhpur, the views of the Blue City and the Mehrangarh Fort are absolutely breathtaking.\n\nWhat truly sets Umaid Bhawan apart is the warmth and professionalism of the staff. Every member of the team especially Mr. Gordhan Singh Ji, Mr. Sikander Singh Ji, Mr. Jabar Singh Ji, Mr. Sajjan Singh Ji, Mr. Karan Singh Ji, Mr. Hukum Singh Ji and Mr. Umaid Singh Ji made us feel like royalty. Their attention to detail, genuine smiles, and readiness to go the extra mile made our stay extraordinary.\n\nOur Suite Room was spacious, beautifully furnished, and steeped in history, yet equipped with every modern comfort. The bed was luxurious, the bathroom was grand, and the heritage decor added a unique charm that made us feel like we were living in a bygone era.\n\nDining at the palace was a culinary delight. Each meal at Risala and Pillars was not just delicious, but also beautifully presented, with a menu that honored local Rajasthani flavors while offering international finesse.\n\nWe also thoroughly enjoyed the spa, the vintage car tour, and simply strolling through the manicured gardens. Every corner of the property tells a story, and the history is palpable in the best way.\n\nUmaid Bhawan Palace is more than just a hotel—it’s an experience, a celebration of heritage, and a rare glimpse into a regal lifestyle that most only read about. Whether you're seeking luxury, romance, or cultural richness, this place delivers on every front. We left with hearts full of gratitude and memories to last a lifetime.\n\n5 stars is simply not enough. Highly, highly recommended."

The warm hospitality of the local families, the simplicity of village life, and the chance to learn about traditional crafts like pottery and weaving made the journey unforgettable.\n\nOur guide was very knowledgeable and explained everything about the Bishnoi culture, wildlife, and village traditions with so much passion. Meeting the locals, enjoying authentic Rajasthani food, and seeing the lifestyle of the villagers felt like stepping back in time.\n\nThis is not just a sightseeing tour – it’s a cultural experience that connects you to the roots of Rajasthan. If you are visiting Jodhpur, I highly recommend taking this Village Safari / Bishnoi Village Tour. It was one of the highlights of my trip and deserves a perfect 5 stars! 🌿✨"

The entire experience was well-organized, immersive, and filled with insights into the rich rural traditions of Rajasthan.\n\nHe shared stories and background about the Bishnoi community, their environmental values, and local customs, which really added depth to the experience. During the safari, we got to witness traditional block printing, durry (rug) weaving, and pottery. Watching artisans at work in their homes gave us a newfound appreciation for these age-old crafts. The durry weaving, in particular, stood out — it was inspiring to see the painstaking effort and skill that goes into creating each vibrant piece.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments was spotting blackbucks in the wild. Seeing these graceful animals roaming freely in the open landscape was a rare and beautiful experience.\n\nFurther, the trek to the sunset point was a calm and enjoyable walk through the village surroundings. When we reached the top, we saw a beautiful view. The sky turned orange , and it was a quiet, peaceful moment that we’ll always remember.\n\nAbove all, the hospitality of the owner and his family made the day feel extra special. They were kind, welcoming, and genuinely passionate about what they do. We left with not just photos and souvenirs, but a real sense of connection to the people and culture of the region"

The flavors felt muted compared to what we are used to in Delhi. The Makhaniya Lassi had a thick blob of sweetened raw butter with barely any actual lassi. The Mango Lassi tasted more like a mango shake, and even the chai was just okay.\n\nService was a bit slow, though everything is made fresh. The place looks air-conditioned, but only air coolers were on. Staff was polite, and pricing is very reasonable.\n\nThe highlight, however, was the jalebi; crisp, rich, and full of true desi ghee flavor. It stood out from the rest and felt genuinely special.\n\nWorth a stop if you are nearby, especially for the jalebi. Just go in with modest expectations for the rest."

              "reviewText": "The Phool Mahal, or \"Palace of Flowers,\" is one of the most exquisitely decorated and historically significant chambers within the Mehrangarh Fort in Jodhpur, Rajasthan.\nBuilt in the 18th century by Maharaja Abhaya Singh, it served as a private audience hall and a space for royal entertainment and leisure. The name \"Phool Mahal\" itself suggests its vibrant beauty, as its interiors are designed to evoke the essence of a blooming flower.\nHere's what makes it so remarkable:\n* Opulent Decor: The palace is renowned for its extravagant decoration, featuring intricate frescoes, elaborate carvings, and richly colored wall paintings. The walls and ceilings are adorned with gold leaf work, often using gold brought from Gujarat, creating a lavish and regal ambiance.\n* Artistic Excellence: You'll find a stunning display of Rajput and Mughal artistry, including detailed mirror work, delicate filigree, and vivid murals depicting royal life, traditional motifs, and even illustrations from the famous Raga Mala series (Indian classical music compositions). Portraits of Jodhpur's ancestors also grace the walls.\n* Exclusive Use: Unlike some other parts of the fort, Phool Mahal was a private and exclusive chamber, primarily used by the Maharaja for private gatherings, entertainment by female dancers, and as a personal retreat. This exclusivity is reflected in its less accessible location within the fort.\n* Historical Significance: It stands as a testament to the grandeur and artistic patronage of the Rathore rulers of Jodhpur, offering a glimpse into the lavish lifestyle of the royal family.\nToday, Phool Mahal is a key part of the Mehrangarh Fort museum, allowing visitors to step back in time and admire its unique blend of architectural beauty and artistic splendor."

The hall probably served the purpose of a pleasure dome of the Maharajas, and the female dancers used to stay here. Accordingly the room was made to look as beautiful as a magnificent flower, which earned it the name Phool mahal. The ceiling has golden filigree work, for which it is said, gold was brought from Ahmedabad, Gujarat. There are also some beautiful portraits and paintings, especially the raga mala series, and furniture from the British period to enhance the glory of the room."

When I went there, I saw many small shops close to each other, selling all kinds of things like clothes, bangles, shoes, spices, and handicrafts. The market is built around a beautiful old clock tower, which looks very nice and is a famous landmark. Walking through the narrow streets of the market was a fun experience. I could smell the fresh spices and see bright-colored fabrics everywhere. The shopkeepers were friendly and called us to look at their goods. I also saw many tourists happily bargaining and buying souvenirs to take back home.\n\nThe market is perfect for people who love shopping and want to feel the real local life of Jodhpur. I found many traditional Rajasthani items like mojari shoes, leheriya dupattas, and silver jewelry. The prices were reasonable, and bargaining made shopping even more interesting. Street food stalls were also there, offering tasty snacks like samosas, kachoris, and sweets like gulab jamun. The area around the market was crowded but lively, and I enjoyed seeing the vibrant culture of the city. Sardar Market is truly a place where tradition and colors meet, and it gave me a very happy and memorable experience."

This market, named after Sardar Singh, a former ruler of Jodhpur, is known for its narrow lanes and alleys lined with an array of shops selling a diverse range of goods, offering a unique retail therapy experience.\n\nAt Sardar Market, you can find a plethora of items. Some highlights include colorful Rajasthani textiles such as bandhani sarees and block-printed fabrics, and intricately designed jewelry made of silver and precious stones. This market is also a great place to shop for spices and herbs like vanilla, cardamom, and saffron, essential for many traditional Rajasthani dishes​​​​.\n\nThe market's vibrant stalls are filled with traditional Rajasthani items, including textiles, handcrafted jewelry, leather goods, and spices. It's an excellent spot for purchasing Rajasthani fabrics. However, it's worth noting that the market can be quite crowded, and visitors are advised to be watchful while navigating through its narrow and congested lanes\n\nSardar Market is not just a shopping destination; it's a place that connects you with the past. The market's atmosphere, with its array of clothes, accessories, figurines, and spices, reflects the local life of Rajasthan. The market area is also close to the Clock Tower, or Ghanta Ghar, a 200-year-old structure that offers a panoramic view of the city"

Rooms are noisy, no temperature control, the beds are old and make loud sounds when you even slightly move. The owners are intrusive and very greedy.\n\nThey will take bookings for their more expensive hotel (Jhankaar which is nearby) and send you to this lodge of a home stay citing last-minute emergencies and sell those rooms to foreigners on even higher tariffs. Not at all, reliable.\n\nIndians should particularly stay away from this property as they prioritise foreigners for their good rooms. I feel for the overseas tourists who don’t understand the bare minimum standards followed in the hospitality industry in India. They come with minimum expectations and these guys sell them such bad rooms at 5-6 times the price.\n\nWe won’t go to this place again even if they paid us to live here. We can’t believe we paid for this house. A total waste of our hard earned money."

On our prior request, we were provided a top floor room with a view of Mehrangarh Fort from room as well as balcony. This was the only good part of this hotel. Actually this is more an ancient old home than a than a hotel. Room and washroom was not bad. But two horrible things of this hotel was...1) no lift was available, you have to go up by stairs only, not possible for aged people, 2) We faced load-shedding i.e power cut for sometimes, but no inverter was there. Although they provide us hot water on our demand during power cut period, but they provide it little late which causes us late starting of our sightseeing journey for Jodhpur. Not fully satisfied with their service."

I was surprised to see they served beer on tap and also a full blpwn decently priced alcohol menu. I got both the tap beers. Honestly they werent worth 535 each after seeing how the manager had to fill it. It was so frothy something was up with the machine system. It was in April end and it was not the best time I understand. 10/10 for the place and vibe and stuff but not so much for the overpriced beer. I think I was way too excited to just have found hefe on tap on a random one day trip to Jodhpur. We didnt discover this cafe on our last visit to RAAS hotel for a meal. The area around is lovely and worth a visit just on a good time.\n\nThe walk to the place is good. The step well view is exhilarating. We saw boys swimming in the heat jumping from different heights.

It was lots of fun seeing the teens jump into the well.\nWe had 4 starters and shared it between 2, which was enough (for us at least). They were pretty good, but lacked a bit the Indian spice we asked for. We also shared a beer and did not try the cocktails."

I had heard about this place from friends and my wife, and it was every bit what I had imagined and more, in a good way. It's one of those dependable food joints or restaurants that you have in every city. Pure vegetarian food made with desi ghee and served with a smile. Staff is extremely courteous and well trained, and all the food preparations are made with the most fresh ingredients always. What really stood apart for me was their very good hygiene standards. Not very common in old restaurants to see absolutely clean washrooms and wash basin area. They have a smaller joint on the ground floor with parking for a couple of cars, and then a big hall upstairs for proper dining. Highly recommended for people craving for some authentic Rajasthani vegetarian cuisine."

I recently visited the restaurant and tried their famous Dal Baati—and I must say, it was absolutely delicious! The taste was rich, traditional, and perfectly spiced. The baatis were crispy yet soft inside, and the dal was full of flavor with a comforting home-style touch.The entire thali they serve is very satisfying and gives you a true taste of Rajasthani culture. The portion sizes are generous, and every item on the plate—from churma to gatte ki sabzi—was fresh and well-prepared. The service was fast and polite, and the staff was attentive and friendly, always ready to explain the dishes to tourists or first-time visitors.The restaurant itself is neat and well-organized, with a good ambiance that makes it a great place for families and groups. It’s a pure vegetarian restaurant, so it's ideal for those who follow a veg diet or want to enjoy Indian meals without worrying about non-veg options. They also maintain good hygiene, which is always a plus point.\nGypsy truly gives you value for money and a satisfying dining experience. Whether you're a local or a tourist exploring Jodhpur, I highly recommend visiting Gypsy at least once for their amazing food and warm hospitality. I would definitely return again just for that unforgettable dal baati!"

Tucked away in a vibrant part of the city, easily accessible yet offering a pleasant escape from the bustling streets, this place truly lives up to its reputation. The ambiance is warm and welcoming, perfectly setting the stage for what promises to be an authentic Rajasthani dining experience.\n\nMy recent visit was centered around their legendary Rajasthani Thali, and let me tell you, it was an absolute feast for the senses. The sheer scale of it – a grand spread boasting an incredible **33 different items** – was breathtaking. From the moment the thali arrived, laden with a kaleidoscope of colors and aromas, I knew I was in for something special.\n\nEvery single dish on that platter was a testament to the rich culinary heritage of Rajasthan. The daals were perfectly spiced, the vegetable preparations offered a delightful variety of textures and flavors, and the rotis and puris were served fresh and hot. The famous Gatte ki Sabzi was rich and flavorful, and the churma was decadently sweet, providing a perfect balance to the savory elements. What truly stood out was the **consistently delicious and authentic taste** across all items; nothing felt out of place or generic. Each bite was a delightful discovery, showcasing the subtle complexities of traditional spices and cooking methods.\n\nIt’s more than just a meal; it’s an immersive cultural experience. For anyone visiting Jodhpur and looking to truly savor the essence of Rajasthani vegetarian cuisine, Gypsy Vegetarian Restaurant is an absolute must-visit. You’ll leave feeling incredibly satisfied and with a profound appreciation for the flavors of the Blue City."

Portion sizes were quite small for the price, making it feel overpriced, especially if you’re expecting a proper filling meal.\n\nThe biggest disappointment was the Kabuli. It lacked flavor, was dry, and didn't have the rich taste you’d normally expect from a dish that’s usually packed with spices and aroma."

Turns out I would come to this place every day while I was in Jodhpur, and now I definitely see why.\n\nThe location is very central - right near the infamous clock tower. It is a small venue, but there is both indoor and outdoor seating and it's overall a very cozy place.\n\nFirst thing to note - the coffee. This is hands down the best place for someone to go if they value excellent brewed coffee (and with a range of choices!). Also, their iced teas and ice chai are scrumptious.\n\nAs for the food, there is a small, mostly snack-style menu with a lot of grilled sandwiches and some Indian dishes too. The sandwiches and also the chat are INCREDIBLE if you're after a quick bite (or to share plates between people).\n\nThe business is family owned, and the brothers that run the cafe are always so nice and helpful. They offer cooking classes (which I also did), run by the mother, and for 750 rupees for a 4 hour private class learning so many dishes, it was a very enjoyable experience. Could not recommend this place enough!"

The owners are extremely friendly and honest, which was extremely refreshing after being caught in tourist traps. There is shade to sit in, with deck sets that follow the building looking onto the tower's face.\nThe best part of the experience was definitely the coffee. It was not burnt nor luke warm like most coffee shops. Our cappuccino and americano were absolutely delicious. A must when wanting to relax amidst a busy Jodhpur experience."

Good place to stop and chill when it’s really hot, they serve great drinks, get the iced chai masala and mint and lemon drink!! Their cheese and tomato toaster was also delicious. The best thing about this place are he owners, they’re so lovely to chat to especially the mother. We loved just coming as the vibe was so chilled.\n\nThey are opening up a 2nd place very soon which will have a proper kitchen and bathroom too! If I ever come back I’ll def visit this place again."
