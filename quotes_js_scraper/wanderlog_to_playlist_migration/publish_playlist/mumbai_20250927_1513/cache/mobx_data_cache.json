Lovely sea views and the place to board boats to elephanta caves too. Unfortunately when we were there the gateway was covered in scaffolding while it is being cleaned so not the best for photos but nevertheless an important place to learn about why the gateway was built and its history. Views of the nearby Taj Palace are also stunning from here. Would have loved to have been able to visit on an evening to see it lit up."

              "reviewText": "As a first-time visitor to Mumbai, seeing the Gateway of India was truly one of the highlights of my trip. The moment I arrived, I was awestruck by the grandeur of this iconic monument. The structure itself, with its impressive Indo-Saracenic architecture, stands tall and majestic, overlooking the Arabian Sea. It feels like stepping into a piece of history — you can almost imagine the days when important dignitaries arrived here during the British era.\n\nWhat truly made the experience special was the breathtaking view. Facing the open sea, with the cool breeze on your face and the sound of the waves in the background, the entire scene feels both peaceful and inspiring. The area is lively yet not overwhelming — people are enjoying the view, clicking photos, or simply soaking in the atmosphere.\n\nRight across from the Gateway stands the famous Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, which adds to the charm of the place. The view of this grand hotel alongside the Gateway is picture-perfect, especially as the sun starts to set and the lights slowly illuminate the surroundings.\n\nEverything about my visit felt just right — the clean promenade, the vibrant energy of visitors, and the rich history all around. It’s a spot where you can pause, reflect, and truly appreciate the beauty and spirit of Mumbai. I’d highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city for the first time."

The historic Gothic-style building, lit up in the vibrant tricolour of the Indian flag, looked majestic and full of pride. The saffron, white, and green lights glowing against the night sky created a patriotic atmosphere that gave me goosebumps.\n\nThe calm surroundings made the experience even more special, allowing the beauty of the illuminated structure to stand out. It wasn’t just a visual treat and a reminder of our nation’s rich history and democratic values. Truly a breathtaking sight and one of the best ways to experience the spirit of Independence Day in Mumbai."

For years, it was the city’s tallest structure, at 285 feet. Rajabai Clock Tower has long been a beacon of the Oval Maidan precinct, a visual delight, and a valuable piece of history for the city. After brilliant restoration work by SNK Consultants, the clock tower was handed over to KSA Lighting Designers in 2017 for lighting the tower, the facade and the interiors of the University Library. Kanchan Puri, principal at the firm, tells us the process of this massive undertaking that was completed recently. After years of darkness, the Rajabai Clock Tower finally glowed up in 2021, literally."

The tower stands at a height of 85 m (280 ft) .\n\nAdvertisement\nHistory\nThe Rajabai tower was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, an English architect. He modeled it on Big Ben, the clock tower of the UK houses of Parliament in London.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid on March 1, 1869 and construction was completed in November 1878. The total cost of construction came to Rs. 2 lakhs (Rs. 200,000), a princely sum in those days. This entire cost was defrayed by Premchand Roychand, a prosperous broker who founded the Bombay Stock Exchange on the condition that the tower be named after his mother Rajabai"

Standing at approximately 85 meters, this majestic structure was completed in 1878 and showcases a stunning blend of Venetian and Gothic architecture. Designed by British architect Sir George Gilbert Scott and funded by the businessman Premchand Roychand in memory of his mother Rajabai, the tower holds both historical and sentimental value.\n\nThe intricate carvings, stained glass windows, and detailed stonework reflect the grandeur of the colonial era. The clock itself was once known for its musical chimes that echoed through South Mumbai, although it now ticks quietly. Surrounded by lush greenery and situated within the bustling yet serene university campus, the tower is a peaceful escape amid the city’s chaos.\n\nVisiting the Rajabhai Clock Tower is not just a visual delight but also a journey into Mumbai’s colonial past. While general public access inside the tower is restricted, its exterior is more than enough to leave a lasting impression. It is a must-visit for history buffs, architecture enthusiasts, and anyone looking to witness a symbol of Mumbai’s rich heritage and timeless charm."

The rhythmic crashing of waves against the causeway seems to whisper ancient verses of love and submission, reminding every visitor of the beauty found in seeking. Despite the crowds, the noise, and the ever-changing tides, there is an undeniable tranquility here—an energy that soothes the soul and leaves an imprint on the heart.\n\nA place of beauty, faith, and timeless devotion, Haji Ali Dargah continues to stand as a beacon of hope, drawing people from all walks of life, uniting them in the silent language of the heart."

The Haji Ali Dargah is a mosque and dargah located on an islet off the coast of Worli in the Southern part of Mumbai. Near the heart of the city proper, the dargah is one of the most recognisable landmarks of Mumbai.Nice place for spiritual visit. The imposing Haji Ali is both a mosque and tomb. It was built in 1431 by wealthy Muslim merchant and Sufi saint Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari. This beautifully designed marble structure has Arabian scriptures inscribed on the walls and mirror artwork in the interiors.\n\nThe Dargah is located on a small island in the middle of the Arabian Sea and is accessible through a narrow walking lane. People from all faiths visit this dargah.\nAvoid planning a trip during monsoons, as the pathway gets flooded during high tide, and access to the dargah is cut off."

Many people are busy taking photos, and there are no safety gates along the path. It can be slippery or risky, especially during high tide.\nVisiting hours are from 9:00 AM to 1:00 PM and 4:00 PM to 8:00 PM, depending on weather conditions.\nWhen I visited, the weather turned bad, and I had to wait for more than 2 hours. So plan your visit accordingly!"

              "reviewText": "Haji Ali Dargah stands as a testament to the life and devotion of Sayyed Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari, a wealthy 15th-century merchant from Uzbekistan who renounced his worldly possessions to become a Sufi saint. According to a popular legend, he instructed his followers to cast his coffin into the Arabian Sea after his death, and the dargah was built on the rocky outcrop where it miraculously washed ashore.\n​The dargah's architecture is a stunning example of Indo-Islamic and Mughal styles, crafted from pristine white Makrana marble, the same material used for the Taj Mahal. Situated on a small islet, it is connected to the mainland by a narrow causeway that becomes submerged during high tide, adding to its mystique. The complex features a central tomb, a mosque, and a beautiful courtyard.\n​Haji Ali Dargah is a powerful symbol of social and communal harmony, drawing thousands of visitors daily, especially on Thursdays. People from all faiths and backgrounds visit the shrine to offer prayers, seek blessings, and find solace, irrespective of their caste or creed. This inclusive spirit makes it a beacon of unity in a bustling metropolis.\n​The shrine's serene location and spiritual atmosphere create a truly unique experience. The sight of the white dome and minarets against the backdrop of the Arabian Sea is breathtaking. The dargah is not just a place of worship but a cultural landmark that embodies the spirit of Mumbai's diverse and welcoming nature."

The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya is a beautiful, thoughtfully curated museum full of art, culture, and history. From the moment we walked in, we were captivated.\n\nOne of the first things my daughters (ages 5 and 7) noticed was a Ganesha statue with its trunk damaged. They were distraught and full of questions. We later learned that this damage likely occurred centuries ago—possibly during the Portuguese colonial period, when soldiers used sculptures for target practice. It was a sad yet meaningful teaching moment, showing how even sacred art can be impacted by history. I appreciated that the museum preserves and presents these pieces with care and reverence.\n\nThe museum itself is stunning. I especially loved the Himalayan exhibit—it was peaceful and deeply moving. My daughters were thrilled to spin the prayer wheels and explore the Natural History section, which is full of birds and animals that had them absolutely elated. They also got to color their own artwork in the interactive art area, which was such a fun and creative touch.\n\nThis museum strikes a perfect balance—engaging for kids, enriching for adults, and beautifully maintained. We are so grateful to Raju for bringing us here. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Mumbai!"

Lovely sea views and the place to board boats to elephanta caves too. Unfortunately when we were there the gateway was covered in scaffolding while it is being cleaned so not the best for photos but nevertheless an important place to learn about why the gateway was built and its history. Views of the nearby Taj Palace are also stunning from here. Would have loved to have been able to visit on an evening to see it lit up."

The ambience has become more tourist friendly.\n\nLocated in the midst of busy road near Churchgate station, it's a landmark destination of Mumbai City.\n\nBuilt in 1864, this stunning Gothic Revival fountain and sculpture celebrates the Roman goddess Flora, gracefully perched at the top!\n\nOnce a quiet marvel, today it’s a lively spot right by the bustling road.\n\nWe went there in the evening after sunset and were attracted by the beautiful ambience of the place. On one side is the noise of ongoing traffic while on the other side you can sit and relax as you soak in the beauty of flora fountain.\n\nThe place has been beautifully decorated with sitting facilities that attracts tourists as well as the locals to take a break and sit on the benches or on the grass and invest sometime in the night light that illuminates the area.\n\nThe street side eatery takes care of your small hunger.\n\nIf you are in Mumbai do take this opportunity to visit flora fountain.\n\nWith beautiful lighting and cozy seating, it’s become a must-visit for anyone looking to unwind, snap a selfie, or capture that perfect shot of the surroundings.\n\nFlora Fountain is an iconic blend of history and charm that brings the magic of old Mumbai to life!"

However, after I insisted on going inside, he asked me to get a photocopy of my Identity Card. Once I got the photocopy and filled in my details I was allowed to go inside accompanied by a staff member. Photography is banned inside the synagogue, but on requesting, he allowed me to click a single photograph of the altar.\nThe synagogue is beautiful. It has a very peaceful and soothing vibe. The light entering through the stain glass windows adds to it's beauty. There is a Torah kept in the sanctuary. The staff member explained various parts of the synagogue. There are paper caps for sale, but are very expensive.\nEven the exterior is very beutiful. The combination of blue and white colours is very appealing and draws the attention of every person walking on the street"

The surroundings are aesthetically pleasing and spiritually significant.\n\nHowever, what deeply disappointed me was the complete lack of peace. Visitors were speaking loudly, some were playing music, and others were busy making reels—completely disregarding the sanctity of the place. It was chaotic and disrespectful.\n\nPeace Pagodas are meant for meditation, reflection, and inner calm—a truly beautiful concept. Unfortunately, the atmosphere here felt more like a social circus than a spiritual retreat.\n\nThe management seriously needs to step up and enforce some basic rules of silence and decorum. They could take inspiration from the Peace Pagoda in Nepal, where the environment is far more serene and respectfully maintained."

The short boat ride itself felt refreshing, and after that, there was a road journey that added to the excitement. The road leading to the pagoda is surrounded by beautiful natural greenery on both sides. It is a peaceful stretch where you can enjoy the sights and sounds of nature, and traveling through this scenic route gives a very special kind of joy.\n\nOn reaching the pagoda, I was immediately impressed by its grand structure and calm surroundings. I also participated in a meditation session along with other visitors. Sitting quietly in the vast meditation hall, I felt a sense of deep peace and relaxation. The atmosphere was so serene that time passed without me even realizing it. It was an experience of true mental stillness, something that is rare to find in the busy life of the city.\n\nThe overall view of the place is equally breathtaking. The golden dome, the open surroundings, and the calm environment together create a perfect destination for anyone seeking peace of mind. I would highly recommend visiting the Global Vipassana Pagoda to experience meditation, tranquility, and the beauty of nature all at once."

Washrooms and drinking water facilities are available, along with a small café for refreshments.\n\nA few sections were shut during our visit, but overall the atmosphere was calm and peaceful, especially since we went on a weekday with almost no crowd.\n\nTo reach the Pagoda, you can take a ferry from Gorai, which costs around ₹100 (return ticket). From Borivali railway station or Borivali metro station, you can take a shared auto to the ferry point. The journey itself was smooth and added to the experience.\n\nOverall, a wonderful place to visit for peace, meditation, and beautiful architecture, away from the chaos of the city"

              "reviewText": "(07/03/2025) I recently visited the Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount, also known as Mount St Mary Church, in Bandra, Mumbai. Although the church was under construction during my visit, I was still able to appreciate its stunning design and architecture.\n\nDespite the ongoing construction work, the church's design and architecture still shone through. I was particularly impressed by the blend of Gothic and Romanesque styles, which added to the church's unique charm.\n\nThe church's history and significance were also evident, and I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about its importance in the local community.\n\nMy only suggestion would be to plan your visit once the construction work is complete, as it would be wonderful to experience the church in all its glory.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend visiting the Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount, even if it's just to admire its stunning design and architecture. It's a truly special place that is sure to leave a lasting impression."

You can genuinely feel the presence of divinity there.\nYes, it does get quite crowded during the St. Mary’s Feast, but even that feels like a sacred and uplifting experience.\nYou can also visit during quieter times and sit there peacefully for as long as you like.\nI absolutely loved it and find myself going back often."

Whether you’re here seeking a moment of prayer, or simply a peaceful corner to soak in Mumbai’s cultural charm, this spot is pure magic."

The church looks beautiful even though some renovation/restoration work is going on at the moment. Still, the place retains its charm and is definitely worth a stop. It's very near to Shah Rukh Khan's Mannat, Ranbir Kapoor's Vastu apartment, and John Abraham's Villa in the Sky.\n\nAnother thing that stood out (and honestly deserves a mention) was the washroom—by far the cleanest one we came across in our entire 10-day Pune–Mumbai trip. Small detail, but it really makes a difference when you’re traveling around.\n\nOverall, a serene spot with a mix of spirituality, heritage, and great upkeep. Would recommend dropping by if you’re in Bandra."

Nothing beats the magical experience of sitting by the promenade, listening to the soothing sound of the Arabian Sea waves, and watching the world go by. The endless stretch is peaceful yet full of life, where you can see families, couples, friends, and fitness enthusiasts all enjoying the same beautiful view. Sunrises here bring calmness, sunsets paint the sky with breathtaking colors, and nights transform the curve into the sparkling ‘Queen’s Necklace,’ making it absolutely enchanting. Street-side chai, cool breeze, and the vibrant city lights add to the unforgettable vibe. Marine Drive is more than just a place — it’s an emotion that every visitor must experience.A must-visit in Mumbai — peaceful, scenic, and lively at the same time.

The journey involves a scenic boat ride to and from the cave site, which, although lengthy, is rewarding upon arrival. Safety measures are in place on the boats, including the provision of life jackets.\n\nBe prepared for long queues while boarding the ferry, especially during peak hours. It is advisable to carry essentials such as a cap or umbrella, drinking water, and sunscreen, as the area can be quite sunny and hot. Proper preparation will help ensure a more comfortable and enjoyable experience.\n\nThe ferry ride costs approximately ₹250 for a round trip. Upon arrival, visitors can either walk to the ticket counter or take a toy train, which costs around ₹10. The entry fee to the caves is about ₹40. You’ll also find several small outlets selling refreshments, along with shops offering souvenirs such as magnets, bags, and unique antiques.\n\nIt’s advisable to allocate at least 5–6 hours to fully explore the site and enjoy the experience at a relaxed pace. Conveniently located near the Gateway of India, this makes for a culturally rich and enjoyable day trip."

              "reviewText": "Visiting the Elephanta Caves is like stepping into a living monument of India’s spiritual and artistic glory. Located on a tranquil island just a ferry ride from the Gateway of India, these rock-cut caves are believed to have been created during the mid-5th to 6th century CE, most likely under the rule of the Kalachuri dynasty, a Hindu dynasty known for their patronage of Shaivism (worship of Lord Shiva).\n\nThe highlight is the great cave (Cave 1) dedicated to Lord Shiva, which houses the magnificent Trimurti—a 20-foot-tall three-headed sculpture representing Shiva as the Creator (Aghora), Preserver (Tatpurusha), and Destroyer (Vamadeva). This masterpiece, along with other panels like the Shiva Nataraja, Ardhanarishvara, and Gangadhara, reflects both exquisite artistry and deep religious symbolism.\n\nThese caves are more than just archaeological wonders—they are sacred spaces shaped by devotion, echoing the beliefs and aesthetics of ancient Hindu culture. Every intricately carved shrine and sculpture whispers stories from a time when Shaivite worship thrived in full grandeur.\n\nDespite multiple visits, the experience never loses its impact. The peaceful island, ancient carvings, and spiritual atmosphere make it a must-visit for history lovers, art enthusiasts, and spiritual seekers alike.\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site that embodies India’s Hindu heritage—Elephanta is not just a place to see, but a place to feel. 🕉️"

You need to take a ferry from Gateway of India, which is a nice ride with sea views. Good for history lovers, photographers, and anyone who wants a peaceful day trip. Best to go in winter or early morning to avoid heat"

Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan famously slept rough on a bench on Marine Drive after arriving in the city as a penniless would-be actor in the late 1960s, just yards from the movie moguls he would later make fortunes for as star of such films as Deewaar and Sholay.",

Renowned for hosting works from some incredibly famous artists, this place truly celebrates creativity.\n\nI attended to support a friend's painting, and I was impressed by the thoughtful decorations that enhanced the overall experience. The venue had a stunning aesthetic, contributing to a serene atmosphere that allowed visitors to fully appreciate the art on display.\n\nThe cleanliness and maintenance of the space stood out as well. It was refreshing to see such attention to detail in keeping the environment tidy and inviting, which undoubtedly adds to the overall experience.\n\nOne of the best aspects of this venue is that there is generally no entry fee, making it accessible for everyone to enjoy the arts. However, it’s important to note that parking can be a challenge. There is no dedicated parking available, and while there is paid parking in front, it can be quite pricey.\n\nOverall, this venue is a fantastic spot for art enthusiasts and casual visitors alike. I highly recommend checking it out if you have the chance!"

New arts (Photographs, Sculptures, Sketches, Paintings etc) are installed every month for you to never hate the modest, historical art gallery—Jehangir Art Gallery.\n\nIt has free entry for everyone. Air-conditioned rooms with larger than life art installations that makes you escape the ordinary life to a silent, colorful, interesting one. The Gallery is located beside CSMVS museum. On the streets you find more artistes selling their art at bare minimum rates. The street, art gallery, and museum is a part of Mumbai's artistic aura. Visit it if you're nearby Fort.\n\nJehangir Art Gallery is at a walkable distance from Churchgate Station. You can take shared cab for 20rs too. There are two rooms, one on the left and right. I have never been to the upper part so yeah.\n\nFind my clicks from the gallery attached to this review. Enjoy!"

Among the statues on the ground floor is a bust of David Sassoon explaining his role setting up the museum.\n\nThe beautiful old tiles have been prettily polished, the place is immaculately clean, light filtering in through the large windows.  An impressive staircase leads up to a founders gallery and more exhibits.\n\nPop into the shop for novelty art deco style gifts and roam the lush grounds under the shade of beautiful old trees.  A clock tower with an actual working clock - another donation from Sassoon - stands quietly at one end of the compound.\n\nThere is free parking, much appreciated in this part of Bombay."

              "reviewText": "Tucked away in the verdant precincts of Byculla’s Rani Baug, the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum stands as a monument to Mumbai’s layered colonial and cultural past. It is the city’s oldest museum, first conceived in 1855 and officially opened in 1872 under the name Victoria and Albert Museum, Bombay. In 1975, it was renamed in honor of Dr. Bhau Daji Lad—a physician, Sanskrit scholar, and the first Indian Sheriff of Mumbai—who played a key role in its establishment.\n\nThe museum’s architecture is an exemplar of High Victorian design. The two-storied structure features Doric columns, intricate cast-iron railings, Minton tile flooring, chandeliers imported from England, and richly gilded moldings. Every inch of the interior is carefully ornamented in a harmonious palette of celadon green, ivory, and gold. The building was designed by George Birdwood, built by engineers Scott, McClelland & Co., and completed in 1871 after a nearly decade-long construction process.\n\nA major restoration project from 2003 to 2008, spearheaded by the Mumbai Municipal Corporation, INTACH, and the Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation, restored the building to its 19th-century brilliance. The project won the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Award of Excellence for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2005. Another round of restoration concluded in 2025, focusing on structural stability, ceiling frescoes, and lighting enhancements, with a budget of approximately ₹3 crore.\n\nThe museum's collection is a meticulous archive of Mumbai’s transformation from a cluster of fishing islands to a cosmopolitan metropolis. Its six main galleries house over 700 artifacts, ranging from 18th-century dioramas and clay models representing indigenous communities, to industrial arts such as silverware, Bidriware, lacquer work, and early ceramic styles produced in Bombay’s colonial-era factories.\n\nA key attraction is the Origins of Mumbai Gallery, which features rare lithographs, maps from the 16th to 19th centuries, and photographs documenting the city's reclamation projects, dock expansion, and suburban rail networks. Another remarkable display is the massive basalt elephant sculpture from Elephanta Island, which stood at the museum’s entrance for over a century before being relocated to the interior.\n\nThe museum also holds significant archival material on the founders of Bombay’s civic identity, including Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, Jaganath Shankarseth, Dr. George Buist, and of course, Dr. Bhau Daji Lad himself. Portraits, correspondence, medals, and minutes from civic meetings offer a glimpse into the city’s philanthropic and intellectual roots.\n\nIn recent years, the museum has become a cultural hub. It organizes contemporary art exhibitions, heritage walks, documentary screenings, children's workshops, and public lectures. Collaborative projects with international museums have brought rare traveling exhibitions, including displays on Art Deco furniture, Indo-Saracenic design, and the architecture of modern Indian cities.\n\nOperational hours are from 10:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Tuesday to Sunday, with a nominal entry fee ranging between ₹20 and ₹100. Audio guides in English, Hindi, and Marathi are available. The museum is easily accessible via Byculla Station, and its location within the historic Jijamata Udyan makes it a compelling day trip for families and researchers alike.\n\nThe museum’s grandeur lies not just in its aesthetic majesty but in its careful accumulation of civic memory. Unlike larger national museums that often present sweeping narratives, the Bhau Daji Lad Museum excels in precise storytelling—through documents, materials, and crafts that trace the evolution of Bombay as a global port city.\n\nIn sum, this museum is both an architectural gem and an intellectual reservoir. It offers a uniquely Mumbai-centric lens into India’s urban, artistic, and social history. It is not simply a museum to be visited, but a heritage space to be absorbed—quietly, slowly, and with respect for the depth it offers."

The painstakingly renovated and beautifully maintained exterior and interiors are a visual treat, somewhat overwhelming the actual exhibits.\n\nThe floor tiles, the painted columns, the ceiling, the windows, the beautiful  staircase with its exquisite wrought iron banisters .... a photographers paradise.  Outside you will find the damaged circa 9C stone elephant from whom Elephanta island gets its name.  Also some British era marble statues and other sculptures.\n\nSome of the exhibits inside are tableaux of early Bombay (now Mumbai), the original islands, inhabitants etc.\n\nEntry is INR20 for adults, INR10 for Sr. citizens.  There is a separate fee for photography but phone cam photography is free.\n\nI went on a weekday morning with low footfalls.  It can get crowded here quite often due to busloads of schoolkids and other visitors for the zoo also making a quick round of the museum.\n\nEstimated time : Around an hour depending on your interest."

Just going outside of domestic portion of Terminal 1 you have to go right and you will see the bus stand. Just show your boarding pass and you will be elligible for free bus ride to terminal 2. I found domestic area of  terminal 2 is quite bigger than terminal 1. It is much decorated and looks very beautiful at night. Travel lounge is also available named as Adani lounge which is very spacious. There is also smoke zone in terminal 2. The terminal 2 is moderately clean  and it is very crowded terminal.

The cathedral is known for its neo-classical and neo-Gothic architecture, peaceful ambiance, and historical significance, including being the “Zero Point” of colonial Bombay, from which distances were measured.\n\nMust see"

Built in the early 1700s, it’s the city’s oldest Anglican church and feels like a peaceful sanctuary surrounded by history.\n\nWhat took me by surprise were the many graves laid directly into the floor. I made sure my husband and our daughters, ages five and seven, were careful not to step on any. My girls noticed a small white grave and were curious if it belonged to a child. When we read the inscription, we saw that it was for a 54-year-old woman, the wife of an officer. That moment sparked quiet reflection and curiosity in all of us.\n\nInside, we saw the seat where Mother Teresa had once sat, which was marked with a small plaque. Nearby were two elegant seats once used by King George V and Queen Mary during their visit in 1911. My husband and daughters loved the experience of sitting in those very seats, imagining what it must have been like over a century ago.\n\nWhat I personally loved most was the peace I felt in the church. Before this trip, many people had asked me to pray for them, knowing this journey was meaningful to me on a spiritual level. In the stillness of the cathedral, I took time to sit quietly and pray for each of them. It was a heartfelt and emotional experience.\n\nWe left with calm hearts and lasting memories. I truly loved this visit."

To such a point that they won't know which university exam is happening at the college till a student goes to the office asking about seat numbers.\n\nOtherwise it looks like they are trying to keep the building up to its old glory days, but it will take a lot more efforts from the students to respect the building."

It is built over Mahim Bay. It is the second longest sea bridge after Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (commonly known as Atal Setu). It is an engineering marvel made to save hours of transit time to lacs of commuters daily. Stopping on the bridge is not allowed, no pictures to be taken by halting on the bridge, Great views of the city and the sea while moving over it."

The best time to visit is around 7:00 to 7:30 PM, just when the sun is setting and the sky turns into shades of orange and pink. The view of the Arabian Sea with the glowing sunset in the background looks absolutely magical. As the bridge curves gently over the water, the cool breeze and peaceful vibe make the drive unforgettable. It’s clean, well-maintained, and gives a different kind of calmness even in the heart of a busy city like Mumbai.\n\nAs the sun sets and night begins, the entire Sea Link lights up, offering a completely different vibe. The beautifully lit cables and smooth road beneath the dark sky create a perfect blend of modern architecture and nature. Though bikes aren’t allowed, the car drive itself is enough to enjoy the charm of this place. If you're ever in Mumbai, don’t miss an evening or night drive on this iconic bridge—it feels like a scene from a movie. Truly, a peaceful escape in the middle of city chaos!"

This means you don’t have to take the long and crowded route through Mahim and Dadar.\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. It saves a lot of time, especially during peak hours. What used to take 40–60 minutes can now take just 10–15 minutes.\n\nWho can use it? Only four-wheelers like cars and taxis. Two-wheelers, autos, and pedestrians are not allowed. It is safe, smooth, and has fewer chances of traffic jams.\n\nHow much is the toll? It’s around ₹100 for a one-way trip. A return ticket or monthly pass is also available. The toll booth is fast with digital payment options too.\n\nHow is the view? Very beautiful. You drive above the sea, and during sunset or at night, it looks amazing. But you cannot stop on the bridge to click photos.\n\nAny traffic issues? Usually not, but sometimes it slows down due to VIP movement or accidents. Early morning or late evening is the best time for a peaceful drive.\n\nCleanliness and road condition? Very clean, modern, and well-maintained. Road quality is excellent.\n\nAnything to be careful about? Maintain your speed, don’t stop, and follow the lane discipline. There are cameras and police on duty.\n\nShould you go? Definitely. Even if you’re a tourist, take a cab and ask to drive through it at least once. It's not just a bridge – it’s a modern symbol of Mumbai’s growth."

Both morning and evening aartis are a soul-stirring experience. The premises are clean, secure, and well-maintained. Best time to visit is early morning to avoid heavy rush.\n\nI had the chance to attend the evening aarti, and it was truly mesmerizing — with the shlokas, dhol beats, and powerful chants filling the air. Ganpati Bappa Morya!"

Had a smooth darshan experience with a strong spiritual vibe.\n\nWhat I liked:\nThe temple has a sacred atmosphere with beautiful gold-plated architecture. Clean and well-maintained with facilities like digital queue management, CCTV, restrooms, water points, cloakroom, Wi-Fi, and ramps for the differently-abled. Aartis are held multiple times a day. Best time to visit is early morning or late evening to avoid rush.\n\nWhat could be better:\nInside the sanctum, darshan time is very short. After waiting in the queue, it felt a bit rushed. Outside vendors selling flowers and offerings can be very pushy. Also, parking is a challenge. It’s better to use public transport or park in paid lots nearby.\n\nOverall:\nA spiritually fulfilling experience with modern arrangements. Just go early, avoid the hawkers, and enjoy your moment with Bappa."

Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this iconic landmark beautifully blends Victorian Gothic Revival architecture with traditional Indian elements.\n\nFrom the moment you step outside the station, you are greeted by an awe-inspiring façade with ornate carvings, domes, turrets, pointed arches, and a magnificent central dome. It was originally designed by British architect Frederick William Stevens and completed in 1887 to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria.\n\nInside, the station is always bustling with activity, serving millions of commuters daily. Despite the heavy footfall, the station is well-managed, with clear signage, dedicated platforms for local and long-distance trains, and essential passenger amenities. Security is also well-maintained with the presence of RPF personnel and CCTV surveillance.\n\nWhat makes CSMT truly unique is that it is a functioning transport hub and a historical monument at the same time. The stained-glass windows, high vaulted ceilings, and heritage lighting inside offer a peek into the colonial past, while the fast-paced train operations represent the pulse of modern Mumbai.\n\nThe station is well connected to major parts of the city and offers good options for local transportation, food outlets, and nearby attractions like the Gateway of India, Marine Drive, and Crawford Market."

Took a train to Borivali and then a shared auto for ₹25 to reach Sanjay Gandhi National Park. From there, I took the ₹20 shuttle bus that takes you straight to the caves. It’s amazing how such a peaceful and serene spot exists in the middle of Mumbai!\n\nThe caves are well-maintained, and the history here is incredible. I was astonished by the big standing Buddha statue—it’s both impressive and calming. The ancient water management system carved into the stone is fascinating—stone channels and cisterns designed to collect and guide rainwater. It’s amazing how advanced the architecture was for its time.\n\nThe ancient monk cells were another highlight—small, carved-out rooms where monks once lived and meditated. Walking through them, you really feel the quiet, spiritual atmosphere of the place. It’s like stepping back into a different time.\n\nI spent about 3 hours exploring every cave—be prepared for a lot of walking and stairs. Carry plenty of water, wear comfortable shoes, and take your time to appreciate the surroundings. There are plenty of shaded spots to rest, which definitely helps.\n\nA big thanks to the security guards—one of them saved me from an aggressive monkey and handed me his stick for protection. Beware of monkeys if you’re carrying food—they’re quick!\n\nTip: Go early to avoid the heat, keep your food sealed, and enjoy the peaceful vibe of this historical escape. It’s definitely worth a visit."

Sadly, they proceeded to ransack many of the shrines in outrage at the unashamed display of idolatry.",

And if u buy anything from the vendors buy from the vendor who is at the beginning of the hill not on the top. They charge u way more but if u want to contribute more to them as they work more climbing their way up and strive to earn surely help them. Going from a ferry to reach and getting a toy train. It was a good experience until we had to face monkeys 🤣🤣 be safe as the monkeys are in 100s they will steal whatever u have in ur hand to eat. I had a bottle of water and chased me finally i handed it over like I surrendered to the monkey. And while on the ferry we saw a dolphin too if u r lucky u will see one. A lot of seagulls trying to get food from u. Make sure to enjoy all of this and be safe from monkeys."

Constructed between the 5th and 6th centuries AD and discovered by a Portuguese sailor in 1534, these caves were once used as a defense point, watchtower, and practice range by Portuguese.\n\nHidden Gems at Elephanta Caves\nAmong the lesser-known features of Elephanta Island are two giant cannons situated at the top of a mountain. These cannons, capable of rotating 360°, were brought by the Portuguese. Below it, you'll find large underground bunkers and storage rooms once used for machinery and ammunition. The abandoned state of these structures invites deep reflection on their historical significance and past use.\n\nThe caves are dedicated to Lord Shiva and feature intricate stone carvings depicting various gods.\n\nAccessible by ferry boats costing around ₹300 per person, the journey itself provides beautiful views of the Arabian Sea. Upon arrival, you'll be greeted by a well-maintained site filled with captivating structures and carvings that showcase the rich history and craftsmanship of the era.\n\nThe island also has small restaurants and shops, providing convenient options for food and souvenirs. Visiting the Elephanta Caves is a must for history enthusiasts and anyone looking to experience the marvels of ancient India. The impressive carvings and the island's historical significance will leave you amazed and intrigued."

Good place with a lot of historical architectures to explore.\nthe paid boats near to Gate way of India can take you to Elephanta caves island. The charges could be from ₹200-250. The last boats starts at 2.00 PM to the island and from there last boat back is at 5.30PM. you could enjoy more if you leave in the morning until 4-5 PM.\nThe boat ride was wonderful. They allowed top deck seats with additional charges of ₹10 inside the boat. At the island the weather is cooler compared to the hot Mumbai City. The caves are good, but you need to have guid for the detailed and informative tour.\nThe monkeys could trouble you if you are carring any good items in hand.\nYou can buy some showcase items from here for your home. Also the shop owners on the Island are very polite and never force you to buy anything. Other than that you can have almost any type of food with reasonable price.\n\nGo and enjoy 😊"

Nothing beats the magical experience of sitting by the promenade, listening to the soothing sound of the Arabian Sea waves, and watching the world go by. The endless stretch is peaceful yet full of life, where you can see families, couples, friends, and fitness enthusiasts all enjoying the same beautiful view. Sunrises here bring calmness, sunsets paint the sky with breathtaking colors, and nights transform the curve into the sparkling ‘Queen’s Necklace,’ making it absolutely enchanting. Street-side chai, cool breeze, and the vibrant city lights add to the unforgettable vibe. Marine Drive is more than just a place — it’s an emotion that every visitor must experience.A must-visit in Mumbai — peaceful, scenic, and lively at the same time. Whether it’s sunrise or midnight, Marine Drive never disappoints. ” 🌊🌆✨"

I had been here around 10-12 years ago during my college days, and at that time, the garden was absolutely beautiful. It used to be very big, full of colorful flowers, well-maintained green grass, and spacious sitting areas — the whole atmosphere was so peaceful and fresh.\n\nBut now, most of the area has been reduced, there are very few flowers, and the green grass has almost disappeared. The beauty and charm which it had earlier is definitely missing now. I still remember how beautiful it used to be during my college days — full of greenery, colorful flowers, and spacious sitting areas. I miss that charm.\n\nGiving 4 stars only because of the memories attached to this place.😊"

              "reviewText": "Timeless Tranquility Above the Arabian Sea: Hanging Gardens, Mumbai\n\nNestled atop Malabar Hill, floating gently above the city’s din and overlooking the Arabian Sea, the Hanging Gardens of Mumbai—officially known as Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens—offer a sanctuary not just of greenery, but of perspective. This is not merely a public garden; it is a verdant amphitheatre of history, memory, and floral artistry, gracefully perched above the chaos of one of the world’s most populous cities.\n\nLaid out in 1881 during the British colonial era, the gardens were named after Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, a prominent Indian political leader, barrister, and municipal reformer often dubbed the “Father of Bombay Municipality.” These terraced gardens were strategically designed atop a vast water reservoir built in 1880 to protect the potable water stored beneath from contamination—a rare fusion of aesthetic charm and functional urban planning. The term “hanging” refers to their tiered structure, reminiscent of the ancient Hanging Gardens of Babylon, though in a uniquely Mumbai avatar.\n\nSpread over 3.5 hectares, the gardens are a botanical canvas of seasonal blooms, trimmed hedges shaped into peacocks and elephants, and walking paths lined with bougainvillea and hibiscus. Early mornings here are cloaked in dew and golden silence, while evenings unfurl a soft breeze laden with the scent of champa and nostalgia.\n\nThe gardens serve not only as a leisure spot but also as a historic lookout point. From the stone-laced edges of the garden, one can gaze upon the Queen’s Necklace—the crescent curve of Marine Drive sparkling at dusk like a diadem of diamonds. The panoramic views extend to Chowpatty Beach and the domes of colonial Mumbai, framed by frangipani branches and monsoon clouds. On clear days, you can trace the outline of Back Bay and the far-off industrial silhouettes of Mumbai’s docks, all quietly pulsating beneath you.\n\nWhat’s lesser known is the role this garden has played in Mumbai’s socio-cultural evolution. Malabar Hill, where it resides, has long been home to the city’s governors, business magnates, and cultural stalwarts. The garden has been a silent witness to morning walks of poets, twilight musings of artists, and first dates under lampposts. It has absorbed the shifting decades—from the horse-drawn carriages of colonial Bombay to the digital hush of smartphone joggers today.\n\nFlora-wise, the garden is home to more than 300 plant species, from native shrubs to exotic ornamental trees. The iconic topiary animals are pruned with extraordinary dedication—a form of green sculpture that evokes both whimsy and discipline. Birdsong is a regular visitor, with over 40 species documented in the area. And if you come at sunrise, you may catch a fleeting glimpse of parakeets, mynas, and even the occasional Brahminy kite soaring above the palm-lined horizon.\n\nThe gardens are open to the public from 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily, and entry is entirely free—a democratic gift of peace in the middle of a bustling megapolis. Benches are generously placed under ancient banyans and jamun trees, and the walking loops stretch to about 1.2 kilometers—perfect for a meditative morning or leisurely evening stroll. Adjacent to the Hanging Gardens lies Kamala Nehru Park, forming a twin green space that doubles the delight for walkers and picnickers alike.\n\nIt’s easy to forget that beneath your feet lies one of the city’s largest water tanks, built during the late 19th century to supply fresh drinking water to South Mumbai. To build a blooming paradise atop a utilitarian tank speaks volumes of the city’s ability to balance necessity and beauty—a rare feat, especially in the urban sprawl of modern India.\n\nIn a city constantly negotiating between its past and its future, the Hanging Gardens offer a still point—a place where history lingers not in museums, but in the fragrance of flowering shrubs and the silence between leaves.\n\nCome not just for a walk—but to rediscover how quietly a city can exhale."

The park opens at 8 AM, and although the ticket queue was long, it was worth the wait. Entry tickets were ₹110 per person, with car parking charged at ₹50 per hour.\n\nWe walked about 7 km, taking in the serene beauty of this lush green haven in the heart of Mumbai. The experience was delightful, with scenic mountains, dense trees, playful monkeys, and deer adding to the charm. The butterfly garden was another highlight, with pretty butterflies fluttering all around.\n\nThe tiger safari, bus fair at ₹136 per person, was an incredible adventure where we spotted tigers, cubs, and a lioness.\n\nUnfortunately, we missed the toy train ride as the lanes are currently under redevelopment, but we’ll be back to try it on our next visit. With so much left to explore, it’s clear the park can’t be fully covered in a single day. We’re already planning a revisit to experience more of this incredible destination.\n\nSanjay Gandhi National Park is a perfect weekend escape, offering a blend of nature and adventure. A must-visit for anyone looking to unwind and reconnect with the outdoors!"

Its 103 per person (enterance tickets to park) ...\nThen go for bus tickets immediately next to enterance ticket counter (instead of cycling in sunny i will recommend buy bus tickets)\nYou can use same tickets to traveling inside park ..it takes u up to kaneri caves and vice versa.. 50 rs per person is the tickets.\n\nAfter you rome cave .. go for museum then flower fragrance gardens (free entry) all r walkable 5 mins circle .\nDon't waste money in buying buggy or safari (means if you can walk and enjoy)\n\nSafaris if u want to see lion n tiger then only its useful .. unless its not worth as its waste of time (suggestions depends on personal thinking)\n\nSecondly be aware of monkeys don't feed to be to close to them\nBags water all r allowed to take inside. Camera(dslr) are bit checked for restrictions.\nOnce u get inside you wont find any water filler so carry it proper before treking.\n\nCarry plenty of water .. there r multiple caves. It takes 2-3 hr if u relax and rome each of them . Don't forget to go to view Point (its cave point watching view).\n\nCanteen is available but those r closed most of time.\n\nLike the review if you find it useful"

The moment you enter, it feels like you’ve stepped into another world — peaceful, green, and full of life. It’s hard to believe something this calm exists within the city.\n\nI visited early in the morning, and the air was fresh and cool. Walking through the forest trails with birds chirping all around was such a refreshing experience. I also rented a cycle and explored the park a bit deeper — totally worth it if you enjoy riding through nature.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the Kanheri Caves. Climbing up to the caves, with all the ancient carvings and the view of the forest from the top, felt like stepping into history. It’s both peaceful and awe-inspiring.\n\nWhat I love most about the park is how it balances natural beauty with easy access. Whether you're into trekking, cycling, photography, or just sitting quietly among trees, this place has something for everyone. I left feeling lighter, calmer, and a little more connected to nature.\n\nHighly recommend spending a few hours here — especially if you live in Mumbai and just need to breathe."

Then the fee will be 80rupi for 2h.\nThe road is mostly flat.\nYou will need to park the bicycle and to walk about 1km to get to the cave site.\nThere are many toilets around and small stands that sell drinks and fruits.\n\nWhat to bring:\nA lot of water\nMoney\nID (for bicycle)\nCap and sports clothing (be ready to sweat)\n\nCost\nThe day I came it was a public holiday so entry was free.\nBicycle 80rupi/2h\nEntrance to cave 300rupi (for foreigners)"

From the base itself, you get a beautiful view of the ocean — but once you go up to the fort, the view becomes even more amazing.\n\nThe Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link looks stunning from here, especially during sunset. This spot has been featured in many Bollywood movies and web series, and when you stand there, you understand why. The calm breeze, sound of the waves, and wide-open sea — it just feels peaceful.\n\nThere’s also a small garden-like area developed around the fort, which is clean and adds to the experience. Families, couples, and even photographers come here just to enjoy the vibe.\n\nHowever, I noticed there’s some construction happening in the sea now — another bridge is being built. Once that’s completed, the clear open sea view from here might not be the same again. So if you want to enjoy this place in its full charm — now is the time to visit."

Located in Bandra West, this fort was built by the Portuguese in the 17th century and still carries the charm of old-world architecture.\n\nWhat makes Bandra Fort truly special is its breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea and the iconic Bandra-Worli Sea Link. The sunset from here is mesmerizing and perfect for photography enthusiasts. The fort is not very large, but the stone walls, ancient structure, and lush greenery around create a peaceful and scenic vibe. It’s a great spot to relax, enjoy the breeze, and take in the beauty of Mumbai’s coastline.\n\nThe place is well-maintained by local authorities. The walking paths are clean, and there are benches where you can sit and admire the sea. The fort is also a popular spot for couples, friends, and tourists looking for a calm evening away from the city’s chaos.\n\nReaching the fort is easy as it is close to Bandra’s main attractions. Entry is free, which is a plus. However, parking is limited, so visiting during weekdays or early evenings is advisable to avoid crowds.\n\nOverall, Bandra Fort is a hidden gem where history meets nature. It’s perfect for history lovers, photographers, and anyone who wants a peaceful break by the sea. Highly recommended!"

I also visited Elephanta Caves which was very nice through ferry if you come to the Gate of India its a must try thing to take the ferry to Elephanta caves which comes at a cost of ₹290 per adult (above 12) and has going ferry cave vist inside and also coming back ferry ⛴️ it's best at weekend to come visit Mumbai because there is less traffic on road than on weekdays"

Lovely sea views and the place to board boats to elephanta caves too. Unfortunately when we were there the gateway was covered in scaffolding while it is being cleaned so not the best for photos but nevertheless an important place to learn about why the gateway was built and its history. Views of the nearby Taj Palace are also stunning from here. Would have loved to have been able to visit on an evening to see it lit up."

The moment I arrived, I was awestruck by the grandeur of this iconic monument. The structure itself, with its impressive Indo-Saracenic architecture, stands tall and majestic, overlooking the Arabian Sea. It feels like stepping into a piece of history — you can almost imagine the days when important dignitaries arrived here during the British era.\n\nWhat truly made the experience special was the breathtaking view. Facing the open sea, with the cool breeze on your face and the sound of the waves in the background, the entire scene feels both peaceful and inspiring. The area is lively yet not overwhelming — people are enjoying the view, clicking photos, or simply soaking in the atmosphere.\n\nRight across from the Gateway stands the famous Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, which adds to the charm of the place. The view of this grand hotel alongside the Gateway is picture-perfect, especially as the sun starts to set and the lights slowly illuminate the surroundings.\n\nEverything about my visit felt just right — the clean promenade, the vibrant energy of visitors, and the rich history all around. It’s a spot where you can pause, reflect, and truly appreciate the beauty and spirit of Mumbai. I’d highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city for the first time."

This UNESCO World Heritage Site, located on Elephanta Island, is a hidden gem just a short boat ride from the city. The caves are home to stunning rock-cut temples that date back to the 6th century and are dedicated to Lord Shiva.\n\nThe main cave is an architectural masterpiece, featuring awe-inspiring sculptures like the giant Trimurti, a 20-foot-high statue depicting the three faces of Lord Shiva. The intricate carvings and serene atmosphere make it feel like you're stepping back in time. Don’t forget to explore the smaller caves, which also offer fascinating artwork and carvings.\n\nThe island itself is peaceful, with lush greenery and beautiful views of the Arabian Sea, making it the perfect spot for a relaxing day away from the city’s hustle and bustle. The hike up to the caves is a bit steep but totally worth it, and there are also toy trains available for a more comfortable ride.\n\n⏰ Timings: Open daily from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM\n💰 Entry Fees: ₹40 for Indian visitors, ₹600 for foreign nationals\n🚤 Boat Ride: Approx. ₹200-₹300 for a round trip\n📸 Photography: Allowed for free, but no tripods in certain areas\n\nWhether you’re a history buff, photography enthusiast, or just someone looking to explore Mumbai’s rich cultural heritage, Elephanta Caves is an unforgettable experience. Highly recommended!"

The journey involves a scenic boat ride to and from the cave site, which, although lengthy, is rewarding upon arrival. Safety measures are in place on the boats, including the provision of life jackets.\n\nBe prepared for long queues while boarding the ferry, especially during peak hours. It is advisable to carry essentials such as a cap or umbrella, drinking water, and sunscreen, as the area can be quite sunny and hot. Proper preparation will help ensure a more comfortable and enjoyable experience.\n\nThe ferry ride costs approximately ₹250 for a round trip. Upon arrival, visitors can either walk to the ticket counter or take a toy train, which costs around ₹10. The entry fee to the caves is about ₹40. You’ll also find several small outlets selling refreshments, along with shops offering souvenirs such as magnets, bags, and unique antiques.\n\nIt’s advisable to allocate at least 5–6 hours to fully explore the site and enjoy the experience at a relaxed pace. Conveniently located near the Gateway of India, this makes for a culturally rich and enjoyable day trip."

There is one toy train running from jetty to the gate which is very useful if you are with kids or elderly persons.

              "reviewText": "Visiting the Elephanta Caves is like stepping into a living monument of India’s spiritual and artistic glory. Located on a tranquil island just a ferry ride from the Gateway of India, these rock-cut caves are believed to have been created during the mid-5th to 6th century CE, most likely under the rule of the Kalachuri dynasty, a Hindu dynasty known for their patronage of Shaivism (worship of Lord Shiva).\n\nThe highlight is the great cave (Cave 1) dedicated to Lord Shiva, which houses the magnificent Trimurti—a 20-foot-tall three-headed sculpture representing Shiva as the Creator (Aghora), Preserver (Tatpurusha), and Destroyer (Vamadeva). This masterpiece, along with other panels like the Shiva Nataraja, Ardhanarishvara, and Gangadhara, reflects both exquisite artistry and deep religious symbolism.\n\nThese caves are more than just archaeological wonders—they are sacred spaces shaped by devotion, echoing the beliefs and aesthetics of ancient Hindu culture. Every intricately carved shrine and sculpture whispers stories from a time when Shaivite worship thrived in full grandeur.\n\nDespite multiple visits, the experience never loses its impact. The peaceful island, ancient carvings, and spiritual atmosphere make it a must-visit for history lovers, art enthusiasts, and spiritual seekers alike.\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site that embodies India’s Hindu heritage—Elephanta is not just a place to see, but a place to feel. 🕉️"

The joy is not just in what you buy, but in the thrill of the bargain. Don’t hesitate to haggle—it’s all part of the fun!\n\nIn between shopping, you can grab a bite at iconic spots like Café Mondegar or Leopold Café, both rich in history and character. Whether you’re sipping cold coffee, people-watching, or just soaking in the vibe, Colaba feels like a slice of Mumbai’s soul.\n\nPro tip: Go early to avoid the rush and wear comfortable shoes—because once you start walking and exploring, you won’t want to stop!"

While the place has its charm with greenery and a calm lake, overall it’s an average experience – nothing too exciting, but not too bad either.\n\n🌳 Nature & Ambience\n\nThe garden and lake area are peaceful and surrounded by trees, offering a break from the busy city life. It’s a decent place for families, couples, or a simple nature walk. However, the area could be maintained better, and some parts feel a bit neglected.\n\n🚣 Boating\n\nBoating is the main attraction here. Paddle boats are available at a reasonable price, and the experience is okay. The lake isn’t very clean, but manageable if you’re just going for a short ride.\n\n🍴 Food & Facilities\n\nThere are no major food stalls inside, so you might want to carry your own snacks. A few local restaurants are available nearby. Basic seating is available, but don’t expect high-end comfort or cleanliness.\n\n🚻 Cleanliness & Maintenance\n\nCleanliness is average. The lake water looks murky, and some benches or corners are not well-kept. Washroom facilities are either not available or not in great condition.\n\n👥 Crowd\n\nIt can get crowded, especially on weekends. Privacy can be an issue, and sometimes visitors may find the behavior of a few people inappropriate."

From the moment we stepped into the park, we were greeted with a vibrant atmosphere and a wide range of exciting water rides.\nThe kids had a blast on the thrilling slides, the lazy river, and the wave pool. There was something for everyone, regardless of age or level of adventure. The park was well-maintained and clean, ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience for all.\nWe also appreciated the ample seating areas and food options available within the park. It was convenient to grab a bite to eat and rest before continuing our aquatic adventures.\nOverall, our visit to Water Kingdom was a huge success. We created lasting memories and had a fantastic time together. If you're looking for a fun-filled day out with your family, I highly recommend checking out Water Kingdom."

The beach itself was clean, though it tends to get quite crowded on weekends and holidays. The entry is rather narrow, which can be a bit of a squeeze during peak times. As I walked along the shoreline, I couldn’t help but notice the stunning, high-profile bungalows dotting the area, adding a sense of luxury to the surroundings. It’s a lovely spot to unwind, whether you're with a companion or a group of friends. Watching the sunset here was truly mesmerizing and definitely worth experiencing."

During our recent visit, the beach was buzzing with people, yet it didn’t take away from the fun and energy the place has to offer. Families, children, joggers, and food vendors fill the shore, making it one of the most happening spots in the city.\n\nWhat made our visit memorable was the boat ride we took. With life jackets on and the sea breeze hitting our faces, it was an exciting experience to ride the waves and enjoy the view of the coastline from the water. The boats aren’t just for show—they give you a real feel of the sea, especially during sunset when the sky meets the ocean in beautiful shades of orange and pink.\n\nAnother fascinating part of Juhu Beach is the air traffic. Being close to the Mumbai airport, you can actually see flights flying just above the beach, extremely low and loud, which adds a dramatic touch to the experience. It’s a surreal sight—waves crashing at your feet and planes roaring above your head.\n\nFrom camel rides to chaat stalls, Juhu has something for everyone. Whether you go for relaxation, food, or adventure, this beach captures the essence of Mumbai like no other."

              "reviewText": "Juhu Beach is one of the most famous beaches in Mumbai, known for its lively atmosphere, street food, and sea view. It attracts tourists, locals, and celebrities alike. But while the place has its charm, it also comes with a few downsides. Here’s a detailed and balanced review.\n\nWhat’s Good\n\nThe beachfront is wide and open, giving beautiful views of the Arabian Sea, especially during sunset. The sea breeze and sound of waves make it a relaxing spot for evening walks or casual hangouts. Local street food stalls are a big attraction here, offering everything from pav bhaji and bhel puri to kulfi and coconut water. The taste is authentic and pocket-friendly.\n\nJuhu is also close to major parts of Mumbai, making it easily accessible. The beach is surrounded by well-known hotels, cafes, and even the bungalows of Bollywood celebrities, which adds to its fame.\n\nFamilies with children often come here in the evening to enjoy pony rides, toy sellers, and balloon games, making it a lively family-friendly destination.\n\nWhat Needs Improvement\n\nDespite being famous, cleanliness is a major issue. On weekends and holidays, the beach gets overcrowded, and littering is common. Plastic waste, leftover food, and bottles are often seen scattered, affecting the beauty and experience.\n\nThe water is not clean enough for swimming or getting into the sea. Many visitors just stay on the shore for safety and hygiene reasons. Also, during monsoon, the beach becomes muddy and slippery.\n\nHawkers and photographers sometimes follow tourists, which may feel uncomfortable. Parking near the beach is limited and can be a hassle during peak hours.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nJuhu Beach has its own charm and is worth visiting once, especially for the sunset view and Mumbai-style street food. However, expect crowds, noise, and lack of cleanliness. It’s more of a casual hangout spot than a clean, peaceful beach experience.\n\nRating: ★★★☆☆ (3 out of 5) – Good for food and vibes, but not ideal for cleanliness or peaceful relaxation."

The acoustics are perfect so you can hear clearly from everywhere. This is one of the few places where the artists by default interact with you after the show so wait or and get some pics with your favorite performer and post it on social media. Yes the idea is to help promote good art music drama etc. As the name suggests it's owned by Prithvi family and you do get to see them at the cafe at times."

As the opinion about the play can be subjective, I'll skip talking about it (it was fantastic).\n\nIt was a houseful show and I was impressed by the crowd management. The general vibe of the theatre and its surroundings are elegant and well maintained. The auditorium itself was comfortable and you have great viewing angles from wherever you are seated. The acoustics were good. The staff in the theatre were firm, but polite in general.\n\nThere is a cafe attached to the theatre that we didn't visit, so I can't talk about it. But it was quite crowded.\n\nPro tip: If you are on a tight budget and want to eat something after watching a play here, your options are severely limited as all the eateries around this area are super expensive. So eat and come."

Constructed in 1891 to address water supply issues, the lake spans approximately 2.1 square kilometers and is surrounded by lush greenery and urban landscapes.

Tourists and locals flock to admire the stunning sunsets, enjoy boat rides, or simply relax by the waterfront. Nearby attractions like the Powai Garden and the Hiranandani Complex add to its appeal.\n\nOver the years, efforts have been made to conserve its natural beauty despite challenges like urbanization. Powai Lake continues to be a cherished landmark, offering a tranquil retreat in the heart of Mumbai."

The entry was fully decorated with candles and the interiors were also decorated. The interiors were complimenting the lit candle or rather the other way round. The tickets were available at a minimal price of 1k ranging till the box seating. For this particular show the box seating was unavailable and all were placed on 3 levels. We bought a 1.5 k per person ticket and were placed on the first mezzanine level.  There was a second mezzanine floor which was a bit pricey. I would surely visit again if given a chance .

We had booked through Zomato to celebrate our anniversary, but unfortunately, the restaurant initially denied our booking. However, with the manager's intervention, we were allocated two rather awkward seats with a poor view. Thankfully, our waiter assisted us in shifting to better seats after we requested.\n\nThe mocktails were delightful, and the prawns were scrumptious, but the chicken dish fell short of our expectations. Additionally, the service was sluggish, and we noticed that the bill included a drink that was never served to us.\n\nDespite these issues, we thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance. On the downside, the valet service was also disappointing, particularly with an app that failed to provide real-time updates."

Food was predictably delectable, welcome drink was savoury. Seating layout is cleverly planned just as conveniently allowed within the space. I wonder how there are people all around yet there is no overlapping of space. Retractable glass roof catches your attention. Service was awesome. They neither barge in for orders nor bother you for time. In fact, the best part is their service well from the very start at the entrance. It almost feels like being escorted to your destination without feeling overwhelming. Only thing I missed, may be unfairly since I had mentioned it, was that I expected something special from them on the occasion."

Our servers Devang and his colleague were courteous and kind.\n\nWe love how the seating space is designed.. most tables facing the view.\n\nWe went here for their Sunday brunch which was fantastic.\n\nWe began with the anti pasti which had salads, dips, cheese, nuts and breads.\n\nWe sipped on refreshing cocktails and mocktails which were good.\n\nThe sushi platter was delicious.\n\nThe salads and appetizers were good. Loved the tasting portions.\n\nFor mains we tried the Dan Dan noodles, dal makhani rice and edamame fried rice. All these dishes were fantastic. We loved them.\n\nDessert was hazelnut praline which was decadent.\n\nWe had a wonderful experience here.\n\nDo give it a try."

I went during sunset, and trust me, there’s absolutely no better time to be there. The golden hues reflecting off the city skyline and the sea breeze brushing past while you sip on a drink… it’s the kind of moment that makes you pause and just feel.\n\nI started with a Matcha mocktail, curious to try something refreshing yet different. The bartender asked me how I liked it, and I said it was good and to my surprise, he smiled and came back with another one on the house! That little gesture of kindness really stood out. It wasn’t just about the drink; it was the thoughtfulness behind it. Shoutout to Imli and Harshal for the lovely complimentary drink, it truly made my day.\n\nFor food, I ordered the Margherita pizza, and it hit the spot. Perfectly crisp, not too heavy, and the flavors were beautifully balanced. It paired so well with the ambiance, laidback yet classy.\n\nA special mention to Tanaji, who not only served us with a smile but also helped click some lovely photos during sunset. It’s rare to find staff who go the extra mile, and everyone here made me feel welcome, relaxed, and cared for.\n\nOverall, AER isn’t just a rooftop lounge with a view, it’s an experience. Whether you’re there for the drinks, the vibes, or just to soak in a peaceful sunset over Mumbai, this place delivers on every front. Can’t wait to visit again!"

It had more space to walk and enjoy the evening breeze.\nYou could sit on the sides and relax, click pictures and enjoy the waters.\nThere are eateries nearby to fill your tummy.\nLess crowds is the selling point of the Beach. The only negative aspect was the garbage. The beach was not clean which is the case with all beaches. People should really understand how their actions hurt others experience."

Versova beach is no exception. 10 mins walking distance from Versova Metro Station.\n\nIf walking, avoid going by the slums route (near thorats barbecue misal) because there's a lot of trash and snack stalls are far. Walk a little more and take Persian Darbar's route aka Main Entrance (extra 5-10 mins walking).\n\nSharing rickshaw from the metro station will cost 20rs per person, it will drop you near the main entrance.\n\nKalkhatta Gola is for 50rs, Mix Gola is for 60rs. You can tell the vendor to make a normal Gola to avoid fancy heart shape. You can rent a beach mat for 150rs or sit on the rocks. Don't throw litter, carry your trash out with you and dispose it in a dustbin. Be responsible and enjoy!"

              "reviewText": "Versova Beach is a hidden gem nestled in the bustling city of Mumbai. With its long stretch of golden sand, the beach is perfect for an early morning stroll or winding down after a hectic day. The rhythmic sound of the waves, the cool sea breeze, and the distant call of the fishermen setting out to sea create a serene atmosphere that’s hard to find in a metro city.\n\nTop Highlights of this Beach –\n• Scenic views: Versova’s coastline offers a beautiful sunrise view with the sea reflecting soft pastels. It’s an ideal spot for photographers and nature lovers.\n• Cleanliness efforts: The beach has come a long way, thanks to regular clean-up drives organized by local volunteers. You’ll often see community members picking up plastic and debris, making the shoreline more enjoyable.\n• Community vibe: There’s a strong local presence here. Fishermen at work, kids flying kites, and families spending time together give the beach a warm, communal feel.\n\nThings to Know:\n• Crowd levels: Weekends and evenings can get busy, especially during festive seasons. If you prefer tranquility, visiting early in the morning is best.\n• Facilities: Basic amenities are available public toilets and a few food stalls serving chai, snacks, and seafood. However, don’t expect luxury cafés or upscale eateries.\n• Safety: The sea can be rough at times. Swim only in designated zones and stay near lifeguard-patrolled areas. The beach is generally safe during daylight hours.\n\nMy Experience:\nI visited on a serene weekday morning. The cool breeze, soft sand underfoot, and the sight of fishermen mending nets made it a calming escape. I joined a local clean-up drive, which added meaning to my visit. Though facilities are simple, the real charm lies in the untouched, local ambience.\n\nOverall, Versova Beach is a must-visit for anyone looking for a quieter, more authentic Ayurvedic sea-breeze escape in Mumbai. I’d recommend adding your own touch by participating in volunteer activities or simply enjoying a peaceful walk."

The restaurant has decent-sized seating and offers a lovely sea view, definitely the highlight of the place. It started raining when we visited, which made the view even better, though the restaurant was almost empty at the time.\n\nFood was just okay in terms of taste and quantity, but the pricing felt on the higher side for what was offered. Drinks were below average too. Hygiene could have been better,  it was manageable but not up to the mark.\n\nThe service was good, and the staff was attentive. The interiors are simple and decent, nothing very impressive. Parking can be figured out around the area.\n\nOverall, the sea view makes it worth a one-time visit, but the food, pricing, and hygiene didn’t really match expectations. Also, the veg options were quite limited, definitely something they could improve."

There was a cover charge (minimum spend) for the deck seating based on the fact that we were just 2 people. However, a few drinks and a full course meal would exceed the minimum spend amount. However, do note that the deck was a closed spaced, atleast at night when we visited it was closed.\nThe food was excellent. 5 star for presentation, taste and service. Only the pork ribs were a disappointment for the amount of meat on the bone. The sushi and fish were excellent and recommended to try. The mock tail was also very good.\nI recommend this place for foodies and people who want to dine early with a view."

They have a unique curation of antiques odds and ends for display and for sale, and the highlight is of course the impeccably restored oldies jukebox.\n\nThe food was great, I loved the cold coffee and I hope to try the flower pot dessert on a return visit. The food order consisted of a portion of fish and chips, which was generous enough. However I take a point off owing to the slightest doubt in the freshness of the fish. I hope to try other menu items on offer, which I hope would perhaps be better. The mango iced tea cooler we ordered was also pretty good."

So we asked them to replace it and they did. It was quite tasty. The Fish & Chips were breaded & fried perfectly.

They have a separate washroom for men & women which was clean too.\nI recommend this place."

Lovely sea views and the place to board boats to elephanta caves too. Unfortunately when we were there the gateway was covered in scaffolding while it is being cleaned so not the best for photos but nevertheless an important place to learn about why the gateway was built and its history. Views of the nearby Taj Palace are also stunning from here. Would have loved to have been able to visit on an evening to see it lit up."

Recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this iconic landmark beautifully blends Victorian Gothic Revival architecture with traditional Indian elements.\n\nFrom the moment you step outside the station, you are greeted by an awe-inspiring façade with ornate carvings, domes, turrets, pointed arches, and a magnificent central dome. It was originally designed by British architect Frederick William Stevens and completed in 1887 to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria.\n\nInside, the station is always bustling with activity, serving millions of commuters daily. Despite the heavy footfall, the station is well-managed, with clear signage, dedicated platforms for local and long-distance trains, and essential passenger amenities. Security is also well-maintained with the presence of RPF personnel and CCTV surveillance.\n\nWhat makes CSMT truly unique is that it is a functioning transport hub and a historical monument at the same time. The stained-glass windows, high vaulted ceilings, and heritage lighting inside offer a peek into the colonial past, while the fast-paced train operations represent the pulse of modern Mumbai.\n\nThe station is well connected to major parts of the city and offers good options for local transportation, food outlets, and nearby attractions like the Gateway of India, Marine Drive, and Crawford Market."

And if u buy anything from the vendors buy from the vendor who is at the beginning of the hill not on the top. They charge u way more but if u want to contribute more to them as they work more climbing their way up and strive to earn surely help them. Going from a ferry to reach and getting a toy train. It was a good experience until we had to face monkeys 🤣🤣 be safe as the monkeys are in 100s they will steal whatever u have in ur hand to eat. I had a bottle of water and chased me finally i handed it over like I surrendered to the monkey. And while on the ferry we saw a dolphin too if u r lucky u will see one. A lot of seagulls trying to get food from u. Make sure to enjoy all of this and be safe from monkeys."

              "reviewText": "Also known as the Gharapuri Caves, the Elephanta Caves are a remarkable historical site situated near Mumbai, India. Constructed between the 5th and 6th centuries AD and discovered by a Portuguese sailor in 1534, these caves were once used as a defense point, watchtower, and practice range by Portuguese.\n\nHidden Gems at Elephanta Caves\nAmong the lesser-known features of Elephanta Island are two giant cannons situated at the top of a mountain. These cannons, capable of rotating 360°, were brought by the Portuguese. Below it, you'll find large underground bunkers and storage rooms once used for machinery and ammunition. The abandoned state of these structures invites deep reflection on their historical significance and past use.\n\nThe caves are dedicated to Lord Shiva and feature intricate stone carvings depicting various gods.\n\nAccessible by ferry boats costing around ₹300 per person, the journey itself provides beautiful views of the Arabian Sea. Upon arrival, you'll be greeted by a well-maintained site filled with captivating structures and carvings that showcase the rich history and craftsmanship of the era.\n\nThe island also has small restaurants and shops, providing convenient options for food and souvenirs. Visiting the Elephanta Caves is a must for history enthusiasts and anyone looking to experience the marvels of ancient India. The impressive carvings and the island's historical significance will leave you amazed and intrigued."

Definitely worth seeing the history.\n\nHowever some of the security guards do look to make some side money in addition to the entrance fee, therefore you should watch out for them approaching you with offers of pictures/information about the place."

Good place with a lot of historical architectures to explore.\nthe paid boats near to Gate way of India can take you to Elephanta caves island. The charges could be from ₹200-250. The last boats starts at 2.00 PM to the island and from there last boat back is at 5.30PM. you could enjoy more if you leave in the morning until 4-5 PM.\nThe boat ride was wonderful. They allowed top deck seats with additional charges of ₹10 inside the boat. At the island the weather is cooler compared to the hot Mumbai City. The caves are good, but you need to have guid for the detailed and informative tour.\nThe monkeys could trouble you if you are carring any good items in hand.\nYou can buy some showcase items from here for your home. Also the shop owners on the Island are very polite and never force you to buy anything. Other than that you can have almost any type of food with reasonable price.\n\nGo and enjoy 😊"

The food is exceptional.\n\nHowever, the service was 10-star.\n\nSome context: I am (un)fortunate to belong to a family of hoteliers, which makes dining with them anywhere an Olympic sport. They are quite critical of poor, or even mediocre, service, and it is a pain to hear long stories about how \"I have spent 40 years in the hotel industry...\" each time some minor thing doesn't meet their standards.\n\nTherefore, when I say the service was so good that my very exacting family were bowled over by the attention, the service, the speed, the efficiency, and all the other adjectives one can attach to great hospitality service.\n\nThe Table restaurant manager and his crew were exception. Warm, welcoming to begin with. Considerate of our dietary restrictions. Made appropriate recommendations so that we could have an excellent experience. It was the whole bag.\n\nSuffice to say, you'll always be guaranteed good food at a top notch restaurant. But great service like this is unique to The Table."

The location itself is a major highlight—sitting by the large windows, I was treated to a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea, making it a perfect spot to enjoy a meal while watching the sunset or the bustling promenade.\n\nI ordered their Chef's Special Pizza, and it was truly exceptional. The pizza boasted a perfectly crisp thin crust, topped generously with fresh ingredients that balanced flavor and texture beautifully. The cheese was rich and gooey, while the toppings—an enticing mix of vegetables and meats—were well-seasoned and thoughtfully paired. Every bite reflected quality and culinary expertise.\n\nBeyond the food, the ambiance was relaxed yet sophisticated, ideal for both casual outings and special occasions. The staff was courteous and attentive, ensuring a pleasant dining experience from start to finish.\n\nOverall, Pizza By the Bay offers more than just great food; it's the combination of delectable pizzas, impeccable service, and the stunning Marine Drive view that makes it a must-visit. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to savor delicious food with an unforgettable backdrop."

Our server was really nice too but I think he needs to be a bit louder when he speaks (northeastern one) sorry if I assumed wrong.\n\nThe only ick about this place was the service charge but you get a discount if you pay through Zomato app to escape those charges which came around ₹177 for us so a ₹150 off on the bill isn’t bad. Overall I rate this place a 4/5.💕"

It was quite busy when we visited this place on weekend. The arieal view of the city Sky line is also amazing. The greenery of this place is well maintained. It was cleaner than I expected. There is no fee to enter the park. Food and drinks are not allowed in the park, but there were local shops outside the park. Washroom is available on the site. There were ample benches for rest shaded Picnic Area. There was abacus kids playing area along with playground. The view of the sea and the city skyline is amazing. Parking is available. Overall, a great place to spend a nice evening. Check out the videos and images and follow me for detailed reviews."

One can view the famous Queen’s Necklace alias Marine Drive from the Kamala Nehru Park on Malabar Hill. Just opposite to the park is the famous Hanging Garden and adjacent to the park is an observatory which provides a clear view of the Marine Drive and the city skyline. Also one can see the Antilia to the left. The park also has various attractions like the shoe house and a heart shape created with flower.\nEntry is free and remain open till 9PM and it is better to visit after sunset so that one can see the Queens necklace."

Kids can climb it, peek through its windows, and adults can’t resist the selfie opportunity. ￼ ￼\n•\tThemed Makeover: After renovations in 2017–18, the park got a colorful nursery-rhyme refresh—think rainbow amphitheater, echo gazebos, a compass-view gallery, and quirky thematic touches. ￼\n•\tViews for Days: Perched above Chowpatty Beach and Marine Drive, it’s one of the best spots in Mumbai to watch the sunset and see the Queen’s Necklace light up at night. ￼\n•\tSerene & Well-Maintained: Despite its popularity, the park stays clean and peaceful—perfect for leisurely strolls, quiet reflection, or just a refreshing break. ￼\n•\tFamily-Friendly: Great for kids—whether it’s playing in the shoe, checking out the echo zones, or running around the flowerbeds. Bonus: entry is free. ￼\n\nTip: Mornings or weekdays are the sweet spot for a relaxed visit—crowds and heat can build up as the day goes on. ￼ ￼"

I had gone especially to see the iconic Boot House, which brought back so many beautiful childhood memories.\nThe park is well-maintained, peaceful, and perfect for a relaxed stroll. From the top, you also get a lovely view of the Nature Trail below. It's a great spot to enjoy the sound of birds and the soothing view of the sea in the distance.\nI truly enjoyed my time here—such a calm and refreshing experience in the heart of the city."

If you have large SUVs like fortuner then you may find some difficulty taking it to beach.\n\nAnd you can take your vehicle to the beach as there is no parking on the road.\n\nThere is a bathroom at the entrance (on the left side) but not maintained at all. Ladies side is totally useless.\n\nBeach itself is good enough. It's both Rocky and Sandy so nice to take pictures and all. Fairly clean.\n\nThe main attraction for me were the lots of tiny crabs. Children enjoyed running behind them.\n\nThey have few horse rides at the beach. You will find gola walas, but I did not find corns.\n\nVerdict: It's a good beach not much crowded. So you can definitely relax and enjoy your time here.\n\nNOTE: Please note that people drink and I found broken pieces of glass bottles at the beach. Please take care of yourself and your kids."

              "reviewText": "I visited Theobroma Café in Matunga King Circle last night and was highly disappointed with my experience. I ordered two pastries: the Dutch Truffle and another chocolate-based pastry, expecting the renowned quality Theobroma is known for. Unfortunately, it fell short of expectations.\n\nFirst, the Dutch Truffle was incredibly underwhelming. It tasted bland, and what shocked me the most was the watery texture. A good truffle should be rich, smooth, and indulgent, but this was anything but that. It felt like the pastry had been sitting out for too long or had not been prepared with care.\n\nThe second pastry was equally unsatisfactory. Both lacked the rich chocolate flavor one anticipates when ordering from a place reputed for desserts. It was almost as if the ingredients used were of substandard quality or the preparation was done hastily.\n\nThe overall experience was disappointing, and for the price point and reputation, Theobroma really needs to maintain higher standards. I hope this review serves as feedback for them to address these quality issues.\n\nWould not recommend based on my recent visit."

They have many more outlet overall Mumbai.\n\nTalking about the ambience and decor of the place it's Amazing much like forest inspired interiors as the name of the place suggests. They have done an incredible job in putting up the overall decor and it feels superb. There is total darkness and spot lights are present on table with some quirky lights and lanterns hanging. Staff was very humble & helpful.\n\nComing to the food's part, we truly enjoyed every single thing we had over here. In drinks we had Lychee blossom and Mocktail of the day;- both the mocktails were super refreshing and good in taste.\n\nIn appetizers we had\n\nMurgh Alishaan kebab :- which was chicken breast tikka marinated in mildly spiced marination and topped with grated cheese. Loved it as it was filling and perfectly cooked with that smokey flavor to it.\n\nDELHIWALI MURGH TANDOORI:-this is tandoori chicken having perfect presentation & it's  all time favourite dish. Taste & super juicy.\n\nIn dessert we had\n\nKulfi & Carmel Custard 🍮 both the dessert are good.\n\nThe service was excellent, captain \"Ravi\" proper take care of us. Overall has a great experience staff is also polite, attentive & place also has great vibes to chill with you friends. Spend a quality time."

We ordered chicken manchow soup, chicken crispy, and it was happy hours other drinks were also ordered. Service was quick, taste was good but quantity was less compared to the prices. They also charged service tax in bill when I asked them to remove it, they said they have written it on their menu card but I still insisted that service charge is always option so they removed it and gave us a revised bill. The restaurant has a quiet & dark ambience with a background of audio flow of water, there are many artificial trees inside. Overall it was a good experience."

It is built over Mahim Bay. It is the second longest sea bridge after Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (commonly known as Atal Setu). It is an engineering marvel made to save hours of transit time to lacs of commuters daily. Stopping on the bridge is not allowed, no pictures to be taken by halting on the bridge, Great views of the city and the sea while moving over it."

The best time to visit is around 7:00 to 7:30 PM, just when the sun is setting and the sky turns into shades of orange and pink. The view of the Arabian Sea with the glowing sunset in the background looks absolutely magical. As the bridge curves gently over the water, the cool breeze and peaceful vibe make the drive unforgettable. It’s clean, well-maintained, and gives a different kind of calmness even in the heart of a busy city like Mumbai.\n\nAs the sun sets and night begins, the entire Sea Link lights up, offering a completely different vibe. The beautifully lit cables and smooth road beneath the dark sky create a perfect blend of modern architecture and nature. Though bikes aren’t allowed, the car drive itself is enough to enjoy the charm of this place. If you're ever in Mumbai, don’t miss an evening or night drive on this iconic bridge—it feels like a scene from a movie. Truly, a peaceful escape in the middle of city chaos!"

This means you don’t have to take the long and crowded route through Mahim and Dadar.\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. It saves a lot of time, especially during peak hours. What used to take 40–60 minutes can now take just 10–15 minutes.\n\nWho can use it? Only four-wheelers like cars and taxis. Two-wheelers, autos, and pedestrians are not allowed. It is safe, smooth, and has fewer chances of traffic jams.\n\nHow much is the toll? It’s around ₹100 for a one-way trip. A return ticket or monthly pass is also available. The toll booth is fast with digital payment options too.\n\nHow is the view? Very beautiful. You drive above the sea, and during sunset or at night, it looks amazing. But you cannot stop on the bridge to click photos.\n\nAny traffic issues? Usually not, but sometimes it slows down due to VIP movement or accidents. Early morning or late evening is the best time for a peaceful drive.\n\nCleanliness and road condition? Very clean, modern, and well-maintained. Road quality is excellent.\n\nAnything to be careful about? Maintain your speed, don’t stop, and follow the lane discipline. There are cameras and police on duty.\n\nShould you go? Definitely. Even if you’re a tourist, take a cab and ask to drive through it at least once. It's not just a bridge – it’s a modern symbol of Mumbai’s growth."

Spanning approximately 5.6 kilometers, it connects the affluent suburbs of Bandra and Worli, significantly reducing travel time across the city’s bustling traffic. Opened to the public in 2010, the bridge features elegant white towers and offers breathtaking views of the Arabian Sea and Mumbai's skyline. It stands as an engineering marvel, showcasing modern design and construction techniques. The Sea Link not only enhances connectivity but has also become an iconic symbol of Mumbai’s urban landscape.."

I recently attended a musical event there and had a good time.\n\nThe air conditioning was perfect, keeping the temperature comfortable throughout the auditorium. In the lobby, there's a cafeteria that offers vegetarian options at reasonable prices. The ladies have access to 2 washrooms, while the gents have 1.\n\nInside the auditorium, you can see signs of wear and tear, like cracked seat coverings and broken floor tiles. The acoustics are great, and the sound is delivered through 4 speakers, 2 on each side of the stage.\n\nMost of the exits are on the right side of the auditorium, with about 4 of them, while there's only 1 exit on the left. A tip for attending a music event there: if you want to dance in the aisles or near the stage, try to get seats from row E onwards. The view from lower seats can get blocked with people standing/dancing especially if you're sitting near the aisles."

The surroundings are aesthetically pleasing and spiritually significant.\n\nHowever, what deeply disappointed me was the complete lack of peace. Visitors were speaking loudly, some were playing music, and others were busy making reels—completely disregarding the sanctity of the place. It was chaotic and disrespectful.\n\nPeace Pagodas are meant for meditation, reflection, and inner calm—a truly beautiful concept. Unfortunately, the atmosphere here felt more like a social circus than a spiritual retreat.\n\nThe management seriously needs to step up and enforce some basic rules of silence and decorum. They could take inspiration from the Peace Pagoda in Nepal, where the environment is far more serene and respectfully maintained."

The short boat ride itself felt refreshing, and after that, there was a road journey that added to the excitement. The road leading to the pagoda is surrounded by beautiful natural greenery on both sides. It is a peaceful stretch where you can enjoy the sights and sounds of nature, and traveling through this scenic route gives a very special kind of joy.\n\nOn reaching the pagoda, I was immediately impressed by its grand structure and calm surroundings. I also participated in a meditation session along with other visitors. Sitting quietly in the vast meditation hall, I felt a sense of deep peace and relaxation. The atmosphere was so serene that time passed without me even realizing it. It was an experience of true mental stillness, something that is rare to find in the busy life of the city.\n\nThe overall view of the place is equally breathtaking. The golden dome, the open surroundings, and the calm environment together create a perfect destination for anyone seeking peace of mind. I would highly recommend visiting the Global Vipassana Pagoda to experience meditation, tranquility, and the beauty of nature all at once."

Washrooms and drinking water facilities are available, along with a small café for refreshments.\n\nA few sections were shut during our visit, but overall the atmosphere was calm and peaceful, especially since we went on a weekday with almost no crowd.\n\nTo reach the Pagoda, you can take a ferry from Gorai, which costs around ₹100 (return ticket). From Borivali railway station or Borivali metro station, you can take a shared auto to the ferry point. The journey itself was smooth and added to the experience.\n\nOverall, a wonderful place to visit for peace, meditation, and beautiful architecture, away from the chaos of the city"

Step inside and the noise of the city melts away, replaced by a calm that’s as beautiful as the church’s stunning architecture. From its steps, the view stretches out across the city, making you linger just a little longer. Whether you’re here seeking a moment of prayer, or simply a peaceful corner to soak in Mumbai’s cultural charm, this spot is pure magic."

The church looks beautiful even though some renovation/restoration work is going on at the moment. Still, the place retains its charm and is definitely worth a stop. It's very near to Shah Rukh Khan's Mannat, Ranbir Kapoor's Vastu apartment, and John Abraham's Villa in the Sky.\n\nAnother thing that stood out (and honestly deserves a mention) was the washroom—by far the cleanest one we came across in our entire 10-day Pune–Mumbai trip. Small detail, but it really makes a difference when you’re traveling around.\n\nOverall, a serene spot with a mix of spirituality, heritage, and great upkeep. Would recommend dropping by if you’re in Bandra."

The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya is a beautiful, thoughtfully curated museum full of art, culture, and history. From the moment we walked in, we were captivated.\n\nOne of the first things my daughters (ages 5 and 7) noticed was a Ganesha statue with its trunk damaged. They were distraught and full of questions. We later learned that this damage likely occurred centuries ago—possibly during the Portuguese colonial period, when soldiers used sculptures for target practice. It was a sad yet meaningful teaching moment, showing how even sacred art can be impacted by history. I appreciated that the museum preserves and presents these pieces with care and reverence.\n\nThe museum itself is stunning. I especially loved the Himalayan exhibit—it was peaceful and deeply moving. My daughters were thrilled to spin the prayer wheels and explore the Natural History section, which is full of birds and animals that had them absolutely elated. They also got to color their own artwork in the interactive art area, which was such a fun and creative touch.\n\nThis museum strikes a perfect balance—engaging for kids, enriching for adults, and beautifully maintained. We are so grateful to Raju for bringing us here. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Mumbai!"

Built in the early 20th century, the architecture itself is a heritage masterpiece with a grand dome and elegant galleries. The museum hosts over 50,000 artifacts spanning Indian and world history—ranging from Indus Valley relics, ancient sculptures, and miniature paintings to arms, textiles, and European art.\n\nKey highlights include the Sculpture Gallery, the renowned Miniature Art Gallery, and special international exhibits. There's also a natural history section and a children’s gallery that appeal to families. Audio guides enhance the experience, and photography is permitted with a small fee. Facilities include a museum shop and café, though air conditioning and accessibility could be better in some areas.\n\nVisitors typically spend 2–3 hours exploring, and the museum is praised for its well-organized layout and rich cultural offerings. Despite minor maintenance issues or temporary gallery closures, the overall experience is memorable and educational. Ideal for history buffs, tourists, and locals alike, CSMVS stands as a cultural gem of Mumbai and a must-visit destination for anyone interested in India’s rich heritage."

Highlights include Indus Valley artefacts, Mughal-era ornate armour, miniature paintings, European and East Asian art, a maritime heritage collection, and a taxidermy section  ￼. Noteworthy exhibits include personal armour of Akbar, ivory jewellery from the Gupta period, and ancient manuscripts.\n\nThe museum is open from 10:15 AM to 6:00 PM (closed Wednesdays and national holidays)  ￼ Photography with permission is allowed, and mobile phones are permitted  ￼. Accessibility is excellent—wheelchairs, elevators, lockers, and tactile guides are available  ￼.\n\nWhether you’re a history buff, art lover, or nature enthusiast, CSMVS is a must-visit.

Quad bikes, horse riding, etc are available for add-on enjoyment. Snack items are there. The only concern is the entry and exit road since it's very narrow.\n\nGood Beach if your are living nearby in hotels. It took hardly 15 min away from Uttan. Clean beach with Speed boat, horse ride, Multi Utility Vehicle Ride etc. Beach has about 4-5 Restaurants where you can have meal after you roam around. Dont park you vehicle at night because of High Tide.\n\nGreat beach, seawater isn't somewhere you would put your feet in. And its hard to access, very small roads and google maps gets it wrong so you are technically on locals to find the route, google will take you to a route thats only for small vehicles, not cars. But amazing views"

Nothing beats the magical experience of sitting by the promenade, listening to the soothing sound of the Arabian Sea waves, and watching the world go by. The endless stretch is peaceful yet full of life, where you can see families, couples, friends, and fitness enthusiasts all enjoying the same beautiful view. Sunrises here bring calmness, sunsets paint the sky with breathtaking colors, and nights transform the curve into the sparkling ‘Queen’s Necklace,’ making it absolutely enchanting. Street-side chai, cool breeze, and the vibrant city lights add to the unforgettable vibe. Marine Drive is more than just a place — it’s an emotion that every visitor must experience.A must-visit in Mumbai — peaceful, scenic, and lively at the same time. Whether it’s sunrise or midnight, Marine Drive never disappoints. ” 🌊🌆✨"

Lovely sea views and the place to board boats to elephanta caves too. Unfortunately when we were there the gateway was covered in scaffolding while it is being cleaned so not the best for photos but nevertheless an important place to learn about why the gateway was built and its history. Views of the nearby Taj Palace are also stunning from here. Would have loved to have been able to visit on an evening to see it lit up."

The moment I arrived, I was awestruck by the grandeur of this iconic monument. The structure itself, with its impressive Indo-Saracenic architecture, stands tall and majestic, overlooking the Arabian Sea. It feels like stepping into a piece of history — you can almost imagine the days when important dignitaries arrived here during the British era.\n\nWhat truly made the experience special was the breathtaking view. Facing the open sea, with the cool breeze on your face and the sound of the waves in the background, the entire scene feels both peaceful and inspiring. The area is lively yet not overwhelming — people are enjoying the view, clicking photos, or simply soaking in the atmosphere.\n\nRight across from the Gateway stands the famous Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, which adds to the charm of the place. The view of this grand hotel alongside the Gateway is picture-perfect, especially as the sun starts to set and the lights slowly illuminate the surroundings.\n\nEverything about my visit felt just right — the clean promenade, the vibrant energy of visitors, and the rich history all around. It’s a spot where you can pause, reflect, and truly appreciate the beauty and spirit of Mumbai. I’d highly recommend it to anyone visiting the city for the first time."

The park opens at 8 AM, and although the ticket queue was long, it was worth the wait. Entry tickets were ₹110 per person, with car parking charged at ₹50 per hour.\n\nWe walked about 7 km, taking in the serene beauty of this lush green haven in the heart of Mumbai. The experience was delightful, with scenic mountains, dense trees, playful monkeys, and deer adding to the charm. The butterfly garden was another highlight, with pretty butterflies fluttering all around.\n\nThe tiger safari, bus fair at ₹136 per person, was an incredible adventure where we spotted tigers, cubs, and a lioness.\n\nUnfortunately, we missed the toy train ride as the lanes are currently under redevelopment, but we’ll be back to try it on our next visit. With so much left to explore, it’s clear the park can’t be fully covered in a single day. We’re already planning a revisit to experience more of this incredible destination.\n\nSanjay Gandhi National Park is a perfect weekend escape, offering a blend of nature and adventure. A must-visit for anyone looking to unwind and reconnect with the outdoors!"

The moment you enter, it feels like you’ve stepped into another world — peaceful, green, and full of life. It’s hard to believe something this calm exists within the city.\n\nI visited early in the morning, and the air was fresh and cool. Walking through the forest trails with birds chirping all around was such a refreshing experience. I also rented a cycle and explored the park a bit deeper — totally worth it if you enjoy riding through nature.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was the Kanheri Caves. Climbing up to the caves, with all the ancient carvings and the view of the forest from the top, felt like stepping into history. It’s both peaceful and awe-inspiring.\n\nWhat I love most about the park is how it balances natural beauty with easy access. Whether you're into trekking, cycling, photography, or just sitting quietly among trees, this place has something for everyone. I left feeling lighter, calmer, and a little more connected to nature.\n\nHighly recommend spending a few hours here — especially if you live in Mumbai and just need to breathe."

              "reviewText": "Beautiful lush green forest in the centre of the city. Sanjay Gandhi National Park is located in Borivali East of Mumbai. It is around 800m from Borivali station. Walking distance.\n\nTICKET FARE FOR INDIANS (As per 2025)\n* Entry ticket fare: Rs 103 per adult (Indian)\n\n* If you take Bicycle from outside (your own or rented from OUTSIDE): Rs 40 would be charged for the entry of the bicycle which makes: Rs 103 + 40 = 143 for entry.\n\n* However you can even rent bicycle form inside the National Park for Rs 40 per hour. But keep in mind to carry your ADHAAR CARD for renting cycle.\n\n* Plan entry time early because by sharp 4pm you have to return the bicycle else you have to pay PENALTY. (I know strict rules)\n\n* Also carry CASH because somewhere they don't accept online and some within the park, network is not there.\n\n* Bus ticket from the national park entry to Kanheri Caves: Rs 50 (return)\n\n* Buggy tickets to drop at Safari begining point: Rs 50 (one way)\n\n* Then from Safari begining point, you have to take actual Safari tickets for: Rs 136. Then sit in the Safari bus.\n\n* Kanheri Caves tickets: Rs 15\n\n* Go, enjoy with your family, friends and loved ones. Carry some food if you want and enjoy it like a picnic, trek."

The caves are home to stunning rock-cut temples that date back to the 6th century and are dedicated to Lord Shiva.\n\nThe main cave is an architectural masterpiece, featuring awe-inspiring sculptures like the giant Trimurti, a 20-foot-high statue depicting the three faces of Lord Shiva.

              "reviewText": "This is absolutely a worthwhile experience and highly recommended for visitors. The journey involves a scenic boat ride to and from the cave site, which, although lengthy, is rewarding upon arrival. Safety measures are in place on the boats, including the provision of life jackets.\n\nBe prepared for long queues while boarding the ferry, especially during peak hours. It is advisable to carry essentials such as a cap or umbrella, drinking water, and sunscreen, as the area can be quite sunny and hot. Proper preparation will help ensure a more comfortable and enjoyable experience.\n\nThe ferry ride costs approximately ₹250 for a round trip. Upon arrival, visitors can either walk to the ticket counter or take a toy train, which costs around ₹10. The entry fee to the caves is about ₹40. You’ll also find several small outlets selling refreshments, along with shops offering souvenirs such as magnets, bags, and unique antiques.\n\nIt’s advisable to allocate at least 5–6 hours to fully explore the site and enjoy the experience at a relaxed pace. Conveniently located near the Gateway of India, this makes for a culturally rich and enjoyable day trip."

Which will take around 1 hour. Average Cost of boat is around 300Rs. Be aware of monkeys. There is one toy train running from jetty to the gate which is very useful if you are with kids or elderly persons. You cab not stay there in night, so have to leave the island before sunset by last boat."

Best to visit when there are more tourists otherwise you may wait 30–60 mins for the boat, which feels like a waste of time."

              "reviewText": "Visiting the Elephanta Caves is like stepping into a living monument of India’s spiritual and artistic glory. Located on a tranquil island just a ferry ride from the Gateway of India, these rock-cut caves are believed to have been created during the mid-5th to 6th century CE, most likely under the rule of the Kalachuri dynasty, a Hindu dynasty known for their patronage of Shaivism (worship of Lord Shiva).\n\nThe highlight is the great cave (Cave 1) dedicated to Lord Shiva, which houses the magnificent Trimurti—a 20-foot-tall three-headed sculpture representing Shiva as the Creator (Aghora), Preserver (Tatpurusha), and Destroyer (Vamadeva). This masterpiece, along with other panels like the Shiva Nataraja, Ardhanarishvara, and Gangadhara, reflects both exquisite artistry and deep religious symbolism.\n\nThese caves are more than just archaeological wonders—they are sacred spaces shaped by devotion, echoing the beliefs and aesthetics of ancient Hindu culture. Every intricately carved shrine and sculpture whispers stories from a time when Shaivite worship thrived in full grandeur.\n\nDespite multiple visits, the experience never loses its impact. The peaceful island, ancient carvings, and spiritual atmosphere make it a must-visit for history lovers, art enthusiasts, and spiritual seekers alike.\n\nA UNESCO World Heritage Site that embodies India’s Hindu heritage—Elephanta is not just a place to see, but a place to feel. 🕉️"

There is toll tax to cross the bridge but it worth it the scenic is awesome 💯 The Bandra–Worli Sea Link (officially known as Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link) is a 5.6km long, 8-lane wide cable-stayed bridge that links Bandra in the Western Suburbs of Mumbai with Worli in South Mumbai. It is built over Mahim Bay. It is the second longest sea bridge after Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (commonly known as Atal Setu). It is an engineering marvel made to save hours of transit time to lacs of commuters daily. Stopping on the bridge is not allowed, no pictures to be taken by halting on the bridge, Great views of the city and the sea while moving over it."

              "reviewText": "Recently, I had the chance to drive over the Bandra-Worli Sea Link, and it was truly a mesmerizing experience. The best time to visit is around 7:00 to 7:30 PM, just when the sun is setting and the sky turns into shades of orange and pink. The view of the Arabian Sea with the glowing sunset in the background looks absolutely magical. As the bridge curves gently over the water, the cool breeze and peaceful vibe make the drive unforgettable. It’s clean, well-maintained, and gives a different kind of calmness even in the heart of a busy city like Mumbai.\n\nAs the sun sets and night begins, the entire Sea Link lights up, offering a completely different vibe. The beautifully lit cables and smooth road beneath the dark sky create a perfect blend of modern architecture and nature. Though bikes aren’t allowed, the car drive itself is enough to enjoy the charm of this place. If you're ever in Mumbai, don’t miss an evening or night drive on this iconic bridge—it feels like a scene from a movie. Truly, a peaceful escape in the middle of city chaos!"

This means you don’t have to take the long and crowded route through Mahim and Dadar.\n\nIs it worth it? Yes. It saves a lot of time, especially during peak hours. What used to take 40–60 minutes can now take just 10–15 minutes.\n\nWho can use it? Only four-wheelers like cars and taxis. Two-wheelers, autos, and pedestrians are not allowed. It is safe, smooth, and has fewer chances of traffic jams.\n\nHow much is the toll? It’s around ₹100 for a one-way trip. A return ticket or monthly pass is also available. The toll booth is fast with digital payment options too.\n\nHow is the view? Very beautiful. You drive above the sea, and during sunset or at night, it looks amazing. But you cannot stop on the bridge to click photos.\n\nAny traffic issues? Usually not, but sometimes it slows down due to VIP movement or accidents. Early morning or late evening is the best time for a peaceful drive.\n\nCleanliness and road condition? Very clean, modern, and well-maintained. Road quality is excellent.\n\nAnything to be careful about? Maintain your speed, don’t stop, and follow the lane discipline. There are cameras and police on duty.\n\nShould you go? Definitely. Even if you’re a tourist, take a cab and ask to drive through it at least once. It's not just a bridge – it’s a modern symbol of Mumbai’s growth."

The surroundings are aesthetically pleasing and spiritually significant.\n\nHowever, what deeply disappointed me was the complete lack of peace. Visitors were speaking loudly, some were playing music, and others were busy making reels—completely disregarding the sanctity of the place. It was chaotic and disrespectful.\n\nPeace Pagodas are meant for meditation, reflection, and inner calm—a truly beautiful concept. Unfortunately, the atmosphere here felt more like a social circus than a spiritual retreat.\n\nThe management seriously needs to step up and enforce some basic rules of silence and decorum. They could take inspiration from the Peace Pagoda in Nepal, where the environment is far more serene and respectfully maintained."

The short boat ride itself felt refreshing, and after that, there was a road journey that added to the excitement. The road leading to the pagoda is surrounded by beautiful natural greenery on both sides. It is a peaceful stretch where you can enjoy the sights and sounds of nature, and traveling through this scenic route gives a very special kind of joy.\n\nOn reaching the pagoda, I was immediately impressed by its grand structure and calm surroundings. I also participated in a meditation session along with other visitors. Sitting quietly in the vast meditation hall, I felt a sense of deep peace and relaxation. The atmosphere was so serene that time passed without me even realizing it. It was an experience of true mental stillness, something that is rare to find in the busy life of the city.\n\nThe overall view of the place is equally breathtaking. The golden dome, the open surroundings, and the calm environment together create a perfect destination for anyone seeking peace of mind. I would highly recommend visiting the Global Vipassana Pagoda to experience meditation, tranquility, and the beauty of nature all at once."

Washrooms and drinking water facilities are available, along with a small café for refreshments.\n\nA few sections were shut during our visit, but overall the atmosphere was calm and peaceful, especially since we went on a weekday with almost no crowd.\n\nTo reach the Pagoda, you can take a ferry from Gorai, which costs around ₹100 (return ticket). From Borivali railway station or Borivali metro station, you can take a shared auto to the ferry point. The journey itself was smooth and added to the experience.\n\nOverall, a wonderful place to visit for peace, meditation, and beautiful architecture, away from the chaos of the city"

The Haji Ali Dargah is a mosque and dargah located on an islet off the coast of Worli in the Southern part of Mumbai. Near the heart of the city proper, the dargah is one of the most recognisable landmarks of Mumbai.Nice place for spiritual visit. The imposing Haji Ali is both a mosque and tomb. It was built in 1431 by wealthy Muslim merchant and Sufi saint Pir Haji Ali Shah Bukhari. This beautifully designed marble structure has Arabian scriptures inscribed on the walls and mirror artwork in the interiors.\n\nThe Dargah is located on a small island in the middle of the Arabian Sea and is accessible through a narrow walking lane. People from all faiths visit this dargah.\nAvoid planning a trip during monsoons, as the pathway gets flooded during high tide, and access to the dargah is cut off."

Although the church was under construction during my visit, I was still able to appreciate its stunning design and architecture.\n\nDespite the ongoing construction work, the church's design and architecture still shone through. I was particularly impressed by the blend of Gothic and Romanesque styles, which added to the church's unique charm.\n\nThe church's history and significance were also evident, and I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about its importance in the local community.\n\nMy only suggestion would be to plan your visit once the construction work is complete, as it would be wonderful to experience the church in all its glory.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend visiting the Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount, even if it's just to admire its stunning design and architecture. It's a truly special place that is sure to leave a lasting impression."

It's very near to Shah Rukh Khan's Mannat, Ranbir Kapoor's Vastu apartment, and John Abraham's Villa in the Sky.\n\nAnother thing that stood out (and honestly deserves a mention) was the washroom—by far the cleanest one we came across in our entire 10-day Pune–Mumbai trip. Small detail, but it really makes a difference when you’re traveling around.\n\nOverall, a serene spot with a mix of spirituality, heritage, and great upkeep. Would recommend dropping by if you’re in Bandra."

Took a train to Borivali and then a shared auto for ₹25 to reach Sanjay Gandhi National Park. From there, I took the ₹20 shuttle bus that takes you straight to the caves. It’s amazing how such a peaceful and serene spot exists in the middle of Mumbai!\n\nThe caves are well-maintained, and the history here is incredible. I was astonished by the big standing Buddha statue—it’s both impressive and calming. The ancient water management system carved into the stone is fascinating—stone channels and cisterns designed to collect and guide rainwater. It’s amazing how advanced the architecture was for its time.\n\nThe ancient monk cells were another highlight—small, carved-out rooms where monks once lived and meditated. Walking through them, you really feel the quiet, spiritual atmosphere of the place. It’s like stepping back into a different time.\n\nI spent about 3 hours exploring every cave—be prepared for a lot of walking and stairs. Carry plenty of water, wear comfortable shoes, and take your time to appreciate the surroundings. There are plenty of shaded spots to rest, which definitely helps.\n\nA big thanks to the security guards—one of them saved me from an aggressive monkey and handed me his stick for protection. Beware of monkeys if you’re carrying food—they’re quick!\n\nTip: Go early to avoid the heat, keep your food sealed, and enjoy the peaceful vibe of this historical escape. It’s definitely worth a visit."

The caves are very interesting and intriguing and the carvings are mesmerizing. There were many mama monkeys and their babies! It's a nice scenic drive from the shuttle stop to the caves. Enjoyed it!  Happy Earth Day!"

The beach itself was clean, though it tends to get quite crowded on weekends and holidays. The entry is rather narrow, which can be a bit of a squeeze during peak times.

Lovely sea views and the place to board boats to elephanta caves too. Unfortunately when we were there the gateway was covered in scaffolding while it is being cleaned so not the best for photos but nevertheless an important place to learn about why the gateway was built and its history. Views of the nearby Taj Palace are also stunning from here. Would have loved to have been able to visit on an evening to see it lit up."

Best time to visit is early morning or late evening to avoid rush.\n\nWhat could be better:\nInside the sanctum, darshan time is very short. After waiting in the queue, it felt a bit rushed. Outside vendors selling flowers and offerings can be very pushy. Also, parking is a challenge. It’s better to use public transport or park in paid lots nearby.\n\nOverall:\nA spiritually fulfilling experience with modern arrangements. Just go early, avoid the hawkers, and enjoy your moment with Bappa."

Renowned for hosting works from some incredibly famous artists, this place truly celebrates creativity.\n\nI attended to support a friend's painting, and I was impressed by the thoughtful decorations that enhanced the overall experience. The venue had a stunning aesthetic, contributing to a serene atmosphere that allowed visitors to fully appreciate the art on display.\n\nThe cleanliness and maintenance of the space stood out as well. It was refreshing to see such attention to detail in keeping the environment tidy and inviting, which undoubtedly adds to the overall experience.\n\nOne of the best aspects of this venue is that there is generally no entry fee, making it accessible for everyone to enjoy the arts. However, it’s important to note that parking can be a challenge. There is no dedicated parking available, and while there is paid parking in front, it can be quite pricey.\n\nOverall, this venue is a fantastic spot for art enthusiasts and casual visitors alike. I highly recommend checking it out if you have the chance!"

New arts (Photographs, Sculptures, Sketches, Paintings etc) are installed every month for you to never hate the modest, historical art gallery—Jehangir Art Gallery.\n\nIt has free entry for everyone. Air-conditioned rooms with larger than life art installations that makes you escape the ordinary life to a silent, colorful, interesting one. The Gallery is located beside CSMVS museum. On the streets you find more artistes selling their art at bare minimum rates. The street, art gallery, and museum is a part of Mumbai's artistic aura. Visit it if you're nearby Fort.\n\nJehangir Art Gallery is at a walkable distance from Churchgate Station. You can take shared cab for 20rs too. There are two rooms, one on the left and right. I have never been to the upper part so yeah.\n\nFind my clicks from the gallery attached to this review. Enjoy!"

From the base itself, you get a beautiful view of the ocean — but once you go up to the fort, the view becomes even more amazing.\n\nThe Rajiv Gandhi Sea Link looks stunning from here, especially during sunset. This spot has been featured in many Bollywood movies and web series, and when you stand there, you understand why. The calm breeze, sound of the waves, and wide-open sea — it just feels peaceful.\n\nThere’s also a small garden-like area developed around the fort, which is clean and adds to the experience. Families, couples, and even photographers come here just to enjoy the vibe.\n\nHowever, I noticed there’s some construction happening in the sea now — another bridge is being built. Once that’s completed, the clear open sea view from here might not be the same again. So if you want to enjoy this place in its full charm — now is the time to visit."

Located in Bandra West, this fort was built by the Portuguese in the 17th century and still carries the charm of old-world architecture.\n\nWhat makes Bandra Fort truly special is its breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea and the iconic Bandra-Worli Sea Link. The sunset from here is mesmerizing and perfect for photography enthusiasts. The fort is not very large, but the stone walls, ancient structure, and lush greenery around create a peaceful and scenic vibe. It’s a great spot to relax, enjoy the breeze, and take in the beauty of Mumbai’s coastline.\n\nThe place is well-maintained by local authorities. The walking paths are clean, and there are benches where you can sit and admire the sea. The fort is also a popular spot for couples, friends, and tourists looking for a calm evening away from the city’s chaos.\n\nReaching the fort is easy as it is close to Bandra’s main attractions. Entry is free, which is a plus. However, parking is limited, so visiting during weekdays or early evenings is advisable to avoid crowds.\n\nOverall, Bandra Fort is a hidden gem where history meets nature. It’s perfect for history lovers, photographers, and anyone who wants a peaceful break by the sea. Highly recommended!"

Lovely sea views and the place to board boats to elephanta caves too. Unfortunately when we were there the gateway was covered in scaffolding while it is being cleaned so not the best for photos but nevertheless an important place to learn about why the gateway was built and its history. Views of the nearby Taj Palace are also stunning from here. Would have loved to have been able to visit on an evening to see it lit up."

Built in 1878 by architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, it was commissioned by businessman Premchand Roychand as a tribute to his mother, hence the name. For years, it was the city’s tallest structure, at 285 feet. Rajabai Clock Tower has long been a beacon of the Oval Maidan precinct, a visual delight, and a valuable piece of history for the city. After brilliant restoration work by SNK Consultants, the clock tower was handed over to KSA Lighting Designers in 2017 for lighting the tower, the facade and the interiors of the University Library. Kanchan Puri, principal at the firm, tells us the process of this massive undertaking that was completed recently. After years of darkness, the Rajabai Clock Tower finally glowed up in 2021, literally."

The tower stands at a height of 85 m (280 ft) .\n\nAdvertisement\nHistory\nThe Rajabai tower was designed by Sir George Gilbert Scott, an English architect. He modeled it on Big Ben, the clock tower of the UK houses of Parliament in London.\n\nThe foundation stone was laid on March 1, 1869 and construction was completed in November 1878. The total cost of construction came to Rs. 2 lakhs (Rs. 200,000), a princely sum in those days. This entire cost was defrayed by Premchand Roychand, a prosperous broker who founded the Bombay Stock Exchange on the condition that the tower be named after his mother Rajabai"

              "reviewText": "The Rajabhai Clock Tower, located in the Fort campus of the University of Mumbai near Churchgate, is one of Mumbai's most iconic landmarks. Standing at approximately 85 meters, this majestic structure was completed in 1878 and showcases a stunning blend of Venetian and Gothic architecture. Designed by British architect Sir George Gilbert Scott and funded by the businessman Premchand Roychand in memory of his mother Rajabai, the tower holds both historical and sentimental value.\n\nThe intricate carvings, stained glass windows, and detailed stonework reflect the grandeur of the colonial era. The clock itself was once known for its musical chimes that echoed through South Mumbai, although it now ticks quietly. Surrounded by lush greenery and situated within the bustling yet serene university campus, the tower is a peaceful escape amid the city’s chaos.\n\nVisiting the Rajabhai Clock Tower is not just a visual delight but also a journey into Mumbai’s colonial past. While general public access inside the tower is restricted, its exterior is more than enough to leave a lasting impression. It is a must-visit for history buffs, architecture enthusiasts, and anyone looking to witness a symbol of Mumbai’s rich heritage and timeless charm."

I had been here around 10-12 years ago during my college days, and at that time, the garden was absolutely beautiful. It used to be very big, full of colorful flowers, well-maintained green grass, and spacious sitting areas — the whole atmosphere was so peaceful and fresh.\n\nBut now, most of the area has been reduced, there are very few flowers, and the green grass has almost disappeared. The beauty and charm which it had earlier is definitely missing now. I still remember how beautiful it used to be during my college days — full of greenery, colorful flowers, and spacious sitting areas. I miss that charm.\n\nGiving 4 stars only because of the memories attached to this place.😊"

              "reviewText": "Timeless Tranquility Above the Arabian Sea: Hanging Gardens, Mumbai\n\nNestled atop Malabar Hill, floating gently above the city’s din and overlooking the Arabian Sea, the Hanging Gardens of Mumbai—officially known as Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens—offer a sanctuary not just of greenery, but of perspective. This is not merely a public garden; it is a verdant amphitheatre of history, memory, and floral artistry, gracefully perched above the chaos of one of the world’s most populous cities.\n\nLaid out in 1881 during the British colonial era, the gardens were named after Sir Pherozeshah Mehta, a prominent Indian political leader, barrister, and municipal reformer often dubbed the “Father of Bombay Municipality.” These terraced gardens were strategically designed atop a vast water reservoir built in 1880 to protect the potable water stored beneath from contamination—a rare fusion of aesthetic charm and functional urban planning. The term “hanging” refers to their tiered structure, reminiscent of the ancient Hanging Gardens of Babylon, though in a uniquely Mumbai avatar.\n\nSpread over 3.5 hectares, the gardens are a botanical canvas of seasonal blooms, trimmed hedges shaped into peacocks and elephants, and walking paths lined with bougainvillea and hibiscus. Early mornings here are cloaked in dew and golden silence, while evenings unfurl a soft breeze laden with the scent of champa and nostalgia.\n\nThe gardens serve not only as a leisure spot but also as a historic lookout point. From the stone-laced edges of the garden, one can gaze upon the Queen’s Necklace—the crescent curve of Marine Drive sparkling at dusk like a diadem of diamonds. The panoramic views extend to Chowpatty Beach and the domes of colonial Mumbai, framed by frangipani branches and monsoon clouds. On clear days, you can trace the outline of Back Bay and the far-off industrial silhouettes of Mumbai’s docks, all quietly pulsating beneath you.\n\nWhat’s lesser known is the role this garden has played in Mumbai’s socio-cultural evolution. Malabar Hill, where it resides, has long been home to the city’s governors, business magnates, and cultural stalwarts. The garden has been a silent witness to morning walks of poets, twilight musings of artists, and first dates under lampposts. It has absorbed the shifting decades—from the horse-drawn carriages of colonial Bombay to the digital hush of smartphone joggers today.\n\nFlora-wise, the garden is home to more than 300 plant species, from native shrubs to exotic ornamental trees. The iconic topiary animals are pruned with extraordinary dedication—a form of green sculpture that evokes both whimsy and discipline. Birdsong is a regular visitor, with over 40 species documented in the area. And if you come at sunrise, you may catch a fleeting glimpse of parakeets, mynas, and even the occasional Brahminy kite soaring above the palm-lined horizon.\n\nThe gardens are open to the public from 5:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily, and entry is entirely free—a democratic gift of peace in the middle of a bustling megapolis. Benches are generously placed under ancient banyans and jamun trees, and the walking loops stretch to about 1.2 kilometers—perfect for a meditative morning or leisurely evening stroll. Adjacent to the Hanging Gardens lies Kamala Nehru Park, forming a twin green space that doubles the delight for walkers and picnickers alike.\n\nIt’s easy to forget that beneath your feet lies one of the city’s largest water tanks, built during the late 19th century to supply fresh drinking water to South Mumbai. To build a blooming paradise atop a utilitarian tank speaks volumes of the city’s ability to balance necessity and beauty—a rare feat, especially in the urban sprawl of modern India.\n\nIn a city constantly negotiating between its past and its future, the Hanging Gardens offer a still point—a place where history lingers not in museums, but in the fragrance of flowering shrubs and the silence between leaves.\n\nCome not just for a walk—but to rediscover how quietly a city can exhale."

The serene atmosphere, surrounded by old temples and traditional houses, makes it a fascinating place to visit.\nHowever, despite its historical value, the site is not maintained as well as it should be. During my visit, I noticed that cleanliness was a major concern. Given that many tourists, including foreigners, visit Banganga to experience India’s heritage, it is crucial that the site is kept in pristine condition. Preserving such places reflects our cultural pride and responsibility.In my opinion the government should take initiative to maintain and restore Banganga Tank. Regular cleaning, better infrastructure, and awareness campaigns can help protect this historic site. With proper care, Banganga can continue to be a beautiful and peaceful retreat in the midst of Mumbai\nIf you are a history lover or someone seeking a peaceful spot in Mumbai, Banganga Tank is worth a visit. But I truly hope to see better maintenance in the future so that this heritage site can shine as it deserves."

According to the Ramayana, Lord Rama, on his way to Ayodhya, struck the earth with his bow to provide water for Sita. The subterranean water (groundwater) source, present since then, not only serves as a drinking water reservoir but also holds profound religious significance in Hindu culture. Lined with stone masonry resembling a step well, Baanganga remains accessible as water levels recede, revealing its architectural beauty. The lake supports aquatic life, look out for sightings of fishes and turtles. As a heritage structure existing for thousands of years, it deserves immediate attention for restoration, cleanup, and maintenance."

The water tank is surrounded by tall trees and lush greenery, making it a perfect place for a quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nThe architecture and design of Banganga are impressive and speak volumes about its rich history. The tank is surrounded by beautifully carved steps, temples, and shrines. The temples and shrines are dedicated to various Hindu deities, and you can see many devotees offering their prayers and performing rituals.\n\nOne of the best things about Banganga is the spiritual energy that one feels while being there. Whether you are a religious person or not, the peaceful and serene environment can make you feel calm and relaxed.\n\nApart from the spiritual and historical significance, Banganga also offers a beautiful view of the Mumbai skyline. The view from the top of the steps is breathtaking and a great spot for photography enthusiasts.\n\nMust-visit place in Mumbai, especially for those interested in history, architecture, and spirituality. The place has a unique charm and character that is hard to find in the busy city life of Mumbai."

There was something for everyone, regardless of age or level of adventure. The park was well-maintained and clean, ensuring a safe and enjoyable experience for all.\nWe also appreciated the ample seating areas and food options available within the park.

The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya is a beautiful, thoughtfully curated museum full of art, culture, and history. From the moment we walked in, we were captivated.\n\nOne of the first things my daughters (ages 5 and 7) noticed was a Ganesha statue with its trunk damaged. They were distraught and full of questions. We later learned that this damage likely occurred centuries ago—possibly during the Portuguese colonial period, when soldiers used sculptures for target practice. It was a sad yet meaningful teaching moment, showing how even sacred art can be impacted by history. I appreciated that the museum preserves and presents these pieces with care and reverence.\n\nThe museum itself is stunning. I especially loved the Himalayan exhibit—it was peaceful and deeply moving. My daughters were thrilled to spin the prayer wheels and explore the Natural History section, which is full of birds and animals that had them absolutely elated. They also got to color their own artwork in the interactive art area, which was such a fun and creative touch.\n\nThis museum strikes a perfect balance—engaging for kids, enriching for adults, and beautifully maintained. We are so grateful to Raju for bringing us here. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Mumbai!"

The atmosphere was electric, with devotees bustling about, preparing for the grand celebrations the next day. As I walked through the premises, I could feel the palpable energy of devotion and service.\n\nBhagavad Gita Teachings\nThe spirit of preparation and service reminded me of the Bhagavad Gita's teachings on Karma Yoga, where Lord Krishna emphasizes the importance of selfless action and duty. The devotees' dedication to their tasks, whether it was decorating the temple or cooking for the crowds, was a testament to the power of Karma Yoga in action.\n\nSatvik Food Options\nISKCON Juhu offers several outlets serving delicious satvik food, which aligns perfectly with the Gita's emphasis on a sattvic diet that promotes spiritual growth and well-being. The food was not only tasty but also prepared with love and devotion, making it a truly satisfying experience.\n\nThandai on a Summer Day\nIf you're visiting ISKCON Juhu during the summer months, Thandai is an absolute must-try! This refreshing drink is perfect for beating the heat and rejuvenating your senses. The Thandai served at ISKCON Juhu is made with love and care, and its cooling properties will leave you feeling refreshed and revitalized.\n\nOverall Experience\nMy visit to ISKCON Juhu was a truly enriching experience. The atmosphere of devotion, the delicious satvik food, and the refreshing Thandai all combined to create a memorable experience. Whether you're a devotee or just looking for a unique cultural experience, ISKCON Juhu is definitely worth a visit.\n\nI would highly recommend ISKCON Juhu to anyone looking for a spiritual and cultural experience. The temple's emphasis on Bhagavad Gita teachings and its beautiful atmosphere make it a must-visit destination for anyone interested in spirituality and Indian culture."

The ambience has become more tourist friendly.\n\nLocated in the midst of busy road near Churchgate station, it's a landmark destination of Mumbai City.\n\nBuilt in 1864, this stunning Gothic Revival fountain and sculpture celebrates the Roman goddess Flora, gracefully perched at the top!\n\nOnce a quiet marvel, today it’s a lively spot right by the bustling road.\n\nWe went there in the evening after sunset and were attracted by the beautiful ambience of the place. On one side is the noise of ongoing traffic while on the other side you can sit and relax as you soak in the beauty of flora fountain.\n\nThe place has been beautifully decorated with sitting facilities that attracts tourists as well as the locals to take a break and sit on the benches or on the grass and invest sometime in the night light that illuminates the area.\n\nThe street side eatery takes care of your small hunger.\n\nIf you are in Mumbai do take this opportunity to visit flora fountain.\n\nWith beautiful lighting and cozy seating, it’s become a must-visit for anyone looking to unwind, snap a selfie, or capture that perfect shot of the surroundings.\n\nFlora Fountain is an iconic blend of history and charm that brings the magic of old Mumbai to life!"

Colour combination, opulence is top notch. Also, provision of silica gels is well thought off specially in Mumbai's humid climate.\n\nCherry in the cake is affordable tickets of just 20/- ."

Among the statues on the ground floor is a bust of David Sassoon explaining his role setting up the museum.\n\nThe beautiful old tiles have been prettily polished, the place is immaculately clean, light filtering in through the large windows.  An impressive staircase leads up to a founders gallery and more exhibits.\n\nPop into the shop for novelty art deco style gifts and roam the lush grounds under the shade of beautiful old trees.  A clock tower with an actual working clock - another donation from Sassoon - stands quietly at one end of the compound.\n\nThere is free parking, much appreciated in this part of Bombay."

              "reviewText": "Tucked away in the verdant precincts of Byculla’s Rani Baug, the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum stands as a monument to Mumbai’s layered colonial and cultural past. It is the city’s oldest museum, first conceived in 1855 and officially opened in 1872 under the name Victoria and Albert Museum, Bombay. In 1975, it was renamed in honor of Dr. Bhau Daji Lad—a physician, Sanskrit scholar, and the first Indian Sheriff of Mumbai—who played a key role in its establishment.\n\nThe museum’s architecture is an exemplar of High Victorian design. The two-storied structure features Doric columns, intricate cast-iron railings, Minton tile flooring, chandeliers imported from England, and richly gilded moldings. Every inch of the interior is carefully ornamented in a harmonious palette of celadon green, ivory, and gold. The building was designed by George Birdwood, built by engineers Scott, McClelland & Co., and completed in 1871 after a nearly decade-long construction process.\n\nA major restoration project from 2003 to 2008, spearheaded by the Mumbai Municipal Corporation, INTACH, and the Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation, restored the building to its 19th-century brilliance. The project won the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Award of Excellence for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2005. Another round of restoration concluded in 2025, focusing on structural stability, ceiling frescoes, and lighting enhancements, with a budget of approximately ₹3 crore.\n\nThe museum's collection is a meticulous archive of Mumbai’s transformation from a cluster of fishing islands to a cosmopolitan metropolis. Its six main galleries house over 700 artifacts, ranging from 18th-century dioramas and clay models representing indigenous communities, to industrial arts such as silverware, Bidriware, lacquer work, and early ceramic styles produced in Bombay’s colonial-era factories.\n\nA key attraction is the Origins of Mumbai Gallery, which features rare lithographs, maps from the 16th to 19th centuries, and photographs documenting the city's reclamation projects, dock expansion, and suburban rail networks. Another remarkable display is the massive basalt elephant sculpture from Elephanta Island, which stood at the museum’s entrance for over a century before being relocated to the interior.\n\nThe museum also holds significant archival material on the founders of Bombay’s civic identity, including Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, Jaganath Shankarseth, Dr. George Buist, and of course, Dr. Bhau Daji Lad himself. Portraits, correspondence, medals, and minutes from civic meetings offer a glimpse into the city’s philanthropic and intellectual roots.\n\nIn recent years, the museum has become a cultural hub. It organizes contemporary art exhibitions, heritage walks, documentary screenings, children's workshops, and public lectures. Collaborative projects with international museums have brought rare traveling exhibitions, including displays on Art Deco furniture, Indo-Saracenic design, and the architecture of modern Indian cities.\n\nOperational hours are from 10:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Tuesday to Sunday, with a nominal entry fee ranging between ₹20 and ₹100. Audio guides in English, Hindi, and Marathi are available. The museum is easily accessible via Byculla Station, and its location within the historic Jijamata Udyan makes it a compelling day trip for families and researchers alike.\n\nThe museum’s grandeur lies not just in its aesthetic majesty but in its careful accumulation of civic memory. Unlike larger national museums that often present sweeping narratives, the Bhau Daji Lad Museum excels in precise storytelling—through documents, materials, and crafts that trace the evolution of Bombay as a global port city.\n\nIn sum, this museum is both an architectural gem and an intellectual reservoir. It offers a uniquely Mumbai-centric lens into India’s urban, artistic, and social history. It is not simply a museum to be visited, but a heritage space to be absorbed—quietly, slowly, and with respect for the depth it offers."

The painstakingly renovated and beautifully maintained exterior and interiors are a visual treat, somewhat overwhelming the actual exhibits.\n\nThe floor tiles, the painted columns, the ceiling, the windows, the beautiful  staircase with its exquisite wrought iron banisters .... a photographers paradise.  Outside you will find the damaged circa 9C stone elephant from whom Elephanta island gets its name.  Also some British era marble statues and other sculptures.\n\nSome of the exhibits inside are tableaux of early Bombay (now Mumbai), the original islands, inhabitants etc.\n\nEntry is INR20 for adults, INR10 for Sr. citizens.  There is a separate fee for photography but phone cam photography is free.\n\nI went on a weekday morning with low footfalls.  It can get crowded here quite often due to busloads of schoolkids and other visitors for the zoo also making a quick round of the museum.\n\nEstimated time : Around an hour depending on your interest."

All the water slides were functional and well-maintained, which added to the fun.\n\nIf you're driving, note that parking is available about 10 minutes away from the park and costs ₹150 for a four-wheeler. However, there's a convenient free shuttle bus service from the parking area to the entrance.\n\nAlternatively, if you're coming from Borivali, you can take the dedicated Water Kingdom ferry boats. For those riding two-wheelers, you can use the Gorai ferry service, which accommodates bikes.\n\nOverall, it was a smooth and enjoyable experience, perfect for a relaxed family outing without the weekend rush."

One can view the famous Queen’s Necklace alias Marine Drive from the Kamala Nehru Park on Malabar Hill. Just opposite to the park is the famous Hanging Garden and adjacent to the park is an observatory which provides a clear view of the Marine Drive and the city skyline. Also one can see the Antilia to the left. The park also has various attractions like the shoe house and a heart shape created with flower.\nEntry is free and remain open till 9PM and it is better to visit after sunset so that one can see the Queens necklace."

Kids can climb it, peek through its windows, and adults can’t resist the selfie opportunity. ￼ ￼\n•\tThemed Makeover: After renovations in 2017–18, the park got a colorful nursery-rhyme refresh—think rainbow amphitheater, echo gazebos, a compass-view gallery, and quirky thematic touches. ￼\n•\tViews for Days: Perched above Chowpatty Beach and Marine Drive, it’s one of the best spots in Mumbai to watch the sunset and see the Queen’s Necklace light up at night. ￼\n•\tSerene & Well-Maintained: Despite its popularity, the park stays clean and peaceful—perfect for leisurely strolls, quiet reflection, or just a refreshing break. ￼\n•\tFamily-Friendly: Great for kids—whether it’s playing in the shoe, checking out the echo zones, or running around the flowerbeds. Bonus: entry is free. ￼\n\nTip: Mornings or weekdays are the sweet spot for a relaxed visit—crowds and heat can build up as the day goes on. ￼ ￼"

Dadar Flower Market is a sensory delight—rows of stalls overflowing with fresh flowers like roses, marigolds, mogra, orchids, and more. It's busiest in the early morning, so if you're planning a visit, arrive before 9 AM to catch the freshest stock and the lively buzz of vendors setting up.\n\nThe atmosphere is chaotic but charming, with vendors calling out prices and buyers haggling for the best deals. It's a great spot for photographers too—there's something beautiful in every corner. The area can get crowded and the lanes are narrow, so be ready for a bit of a squeeze.\n\nPerfect place if you're shopping for festivals, weddings, or just love flowers. Parking is a challenge, so it’s best to come by train (Dadar station is just a few minutes away)."

The early morning hours are particularly magical, as the market awakens with the first light of day.\n\nNavigating through the market may be a bit chaotic, but that's all part of the experience. Embrace the lively atmosphere, enjoy the visual feast, and leave with a bouquet of memories that will linger long after you've left the enchanting world of Dadar Flower Market."

Whoever added pictures here is being a little deceptive.\n\nThe flower market is integrated within the wholesale market down the road and much nearer the railway station.\n\nI don't think I would suggest people make a specific visit here."

              "reviewText": "KidZania Mumbai is a must-visit place for kids! It’s brilliantly designed for childrens where they learn so much through role play and experience various professions in a highly engaging and superb environment.\n\n👉 Realistic Role-Playing: The setup is expectional. Kids learn so much with role play activities in fun way. There's so much to do like a hospital, fire station, bank, bollywood, and more. Kids can role-play as chefs, pilots, doctors, and many more!! The attention of detail in every single activity is just mind-blowing.\n\n👉 Learning with Fun: Every activity is fun with education. Kids learn so much from this activities like life skills, teamwork, spending money and earning money with \"KidZos,\" the in-house currency. I loved this concept a lots as kids learn to spend and earn money as well!\n\n👉 Safety First: The staff is very professional, very friendly, humble and polite and ensures that every child is safe. The RFID bracelets for kids and parents are just superb. Really amazing concept where you can easily track your kids.\n\n👉 Hygiene & Maintenance: The premises is well-maintained and super clean and neat. There is ample seating for parents and even a parents lounge where one can sit.\n\n👉 Food & Refreshments: A variety of food options are available veg, non veg and jain food. The food is very good with superb quality and taste. The food court is spacious and clean.\n\nFor sure plan a full day trip as there’s so much to explore that half a day isn’t enough.\n\nWhile most activities cater to kids aged 4-16, younger children can enjoy the toddler zone.\n\nBoth kids and parents should wear comfortable shoes as there’s lots of walking involved.\n\nOverall KidZania Mumbai is an unforgettable experience for childrens. It's where education meets entertainment in the most fun way. Highly recommended for a family day out! Surely kids are gonna have blast here!!!!!"

Overall, the kids had a fantastic time and thoroughly enjoyed themselves. It’s definitely a must-visit for those who can afford it.\n\nOne downside, however, was not being informed about a school picnic with over 800 students inside. Until around 3 PM, the place felt like a fish market due to the overcrowding, which wasted over an hour of our time. Once the students left, we were able to enjoy the space much more comfortably.\n\nOn the bright side, the facility offers strollers for infants, baggage storage, and several restaurants inside if you get hungry. Despite the initial inconvenience, it was an overall very good experience."

Recommend that kids have shoes for one adventure's rope climbing activity. Toddlers are having less activity compared to teenagers. I have taken 5 hrs tickets which I felt is not sufficient to do all the activities. Better to take a full day ticket. At the beginning you will get kidzania money around 30rs. This money will be used for performing activities. Activities are divided in two parts whereby kids will earn money for some activities and spend the rest of their activities. This way they learn financial management. The restaurant is available inside and has decent varieties. Once your time is over then your wrist band will be deactivated however if you wish to be there then it's absolutely fine. Sufficient car and bike parking is available. I recommend to definitely visit once with your family."

I was extremely worried as I realized the error only later, and I knew that rescheduling wasn’t typically part of their policy. Still, I reached out hoping for some assistance.\n\nTo my absolute relief, not only did they hear me out, but they also treated my situation as a special case and kindly rescheduled the tickets. It may seem like a small gesture, but it meant the world to me and my family.\n\nA special, heartfelt thanks to Princika Rodriguez, who went above and beyond to assist me through the process. She was understanding, patient, and incredibly supportive throughout. I genuinely owe her for a lifetime—her help made what could’ve been a ruined plan into a cherished memory.\n\nThank you once again to the KidZania Mumbai team for showing compassion and understanding. This level of customer care is rare and truly commendable. Highly recommended not just for the fun experience but also for the amazing people behind it! 🙏"

The center was lively and well-organized, with a wide range of interactive exhibits that make learning fun.\n\nI especially loved the Dinosaur and Space sections – both were fascinating and beautifully presented. The life-size dinosaur models were impressive, and the space section sparked a sense of wonder and curiosity.\n\nIt's a perfect place for students, families, and anyone with a curious mind. Highly recommended for a fun and educational outing in Mumbai!"

I was myself surprised with some details and explanations. Its well kept. But some exhibits are broken too.\n\nAt 1.45pm there is a dome movie that can be watch. The dome theatre is a very good concept but hygiene is not maintained during summers. It was damp and stinky, the seats are not well maintained. We found it yucky to be seated there.\n\nThe science center and the exhibits inside are fabulous. you can spend the day here and still wont be able to finish it all. kids would love this learning experience and try everything out themselves.\n\nA must visit place."

They also have demonstrations events like High voltage, Space on Sphere, Oddessy, and much more. All are fun filled, enough to be engaged for at least 4-5 hrs. The museum also has its canteen. The toilets were well maintained and clean.\n\nI took a ticket for all the events packs which costs 250rs. We can choose which events we want to attend. While i was there, there was a dinosaur event. In which they presented original dinosaur eggs , skeletons etc.\n\nOverall a good day out for any science enthusiast."

Just going outside of domestic portion of Terminal 1 you have to go right and you will see the bus stand. Just show your boarding pass and you will be elligible for free bus ride to terminal 2. I found domestic area of  terminal 2 is quite bigger than terminal 1. It is much decorated and looks very beautiful at night. Travel lounge is also available named as Adani lounge which is very spacious. There is also smoke zone in terminal 2. The terminal 2 is moderately clean  and it is very crowded terminal. I saw birds inside the terminal, mostly piegeon inside the airport near securty check area.

You see really healthy and happy animals in almost their natural habitat here.\n\nThe tiger looked majestic, the hyena looked healthy, the leopard was shining, the penguins were glorious, the cross were healthy, the hippos were joyful and the birds were majestic.\n\nParking is well managed and available. Fare for parking is ₹80 for 4 wheelers. We took the family booking and it costed us ₹100. You can carry phone cameras and there are no extra charge for it. Online bookings can be done in advance and the physical queues are well managed.\n\nThis place has 2 fully functional cafes and you can fill yourself up with multiple choices.\n\nI highly recommend this place."

However, I found the food better than most of reviews mentioned here. Chicken baos and Chicken flatbread were super and recommended.\n\nPrices as expected are on higher side but they do run some offers across different food platforms, so do check that out. Overall had a great experience and time here. Cheers!"

I went there during the coldplay concert dates and they had 3k entry per person (included full cover though) my cocktail was nice, tried the classic Lit…service was nice and yes every penny was worth it! You get to see a beautiful sunset and the entire queens necklace, beautiful view of Bombay skyline. Ordered a basket of fries, quantity was great & a mezze platter, must try! The dips were amazing, especially the walnut dip. Great place… gonna give it a solid 9/10"

              "reviewText": "The skyline is, without a doubt, the highlight of dining at Dome, offering a truly spectacular setting. However, I was rather disappointed with a few aspects of the experience.\n\nFirstly, the immaturity of the serving staff was noticeable. Managing the staff in general proved to be quite challenging, but my server, in particular, was difficult to deal with. It gave the impression of a clear lack of professionalism, which detracted from the overall dining experience.\n\nSecondly, we ordered a number of drinks, including some cocktails, and one in particular was quite underwhelming. Given the price point, I had expected far better. In hindsight, I would rather try the Taj next time.\n\nLastly, the selection of snacks was quite disappointing, particularly for vegetarians and vegans, as there were no suitable options available. For a venue of this calibre, one would have expected a more thoughtfully curated menu.\n\nWhile the setting is undoubtedly stunning, the experience itself left much to be desired."

              "reviewText": "Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT), formerly known as Victoria Terminus, is a historic railway station in Mumbai, India. Completed in 1888, it showcases a blend of Victorian Gothic Revival and traditional Indian architectural styles. In 2004, UNESCO recognized its cultural significance by designating it a World Heritage Site.\n\nThe station's architecture is notable for its intricate stone carvings, pointed arches, and a central dome reminiscent of traditional Indian palaces. The interior features high ceilings, spacious halls, and stained-glass windows, reflecting the grandeur of its era. Recent restoration efforts have aimed to preserve these architectural details, ensuring the station remains a visual delight for visitors.\n\nAs one of India's busiest railway stations, CSMT serves as a crucial hub for both long-distance and suburban trains, operating 24 hours a day and accommodating millions of passengers annually. The station is equipped with essential amenities, including waiting rooms, restrooms, and food stalls. However, during peak hours, the station can become exceedingly crowded, which may be overwhelming for some travelers.\n\nVisitors often praise CSMT for its architectural beauty and historical significance. Standing across the road provides a vantage point to appreciate the building's grandeur, though the surrounding hustle and bustle can be distracting. Inside, the station's operational efficiency is notable, but the sheer volume of commuters can lead to congestion, particularly during rush hours. It's advisable to remain vigilant and mindful of personal belongings due to the dense crowds.\n\nBeyond its architectural and functional roles, CSMT holds a special place in Mumbai's cultural landscape. It has been featured in various films and is often associated with the city's colonial past and its evolution into a modern metropolis. The station's presence contributes to Mumbai's identity, symbolizing a blend of history and progress.\n\nDespite its grandeur, CSMT faces several challenges. The station's location in a high-traffic area contributes to significant air pollution, which poses risks to both the structure and the health of commuters. Additionally, the overwhelming crowds during peak hours can be a deterrent for some visitors, making navigation through the station challenging.\n\nChhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus is more than just a railway station; it's a monument that encapsulates Mumbai's rich history and architectural heritage. While its beauty and significance are undeniable, potential visitors should be prepared for the challenges posed by large crowds and the fast-paced environment typical of a major urban transit hub. For those interested in architecture and history, a visit to CSMT offers a rewarding glimpse into Mumbai's past and present."

From the moment I stepped onto the premises, I was in awe of the stunning architecture and the historical grandeur of the station. The beautiful Victorian Gothic design, with intricate carvings, domes, and arches, makes CSMT feel more like a royal palace than a railway station.\n\nThe station is not only visually breathtaking but also incredibly well-organized and efficiently managed, considering the huge number of passengers that pass through daily. Despite the hustle and bustle, everything runs smoothly – from announcements to cleanliness and security arrangements. I noticed that the platforms were regularly cleaned, and there were ample dustbins, signage, and help desks available to guide travelers.\n\nOne of the things I loved the most was how CSMT seamlessly blends history with modernity. The station proudly retains its heritage charm, while also providing modern facilities such as food courts, digital ticket kiosks, clean waiting rooms, and escalators. The lighting at night makes the entire building glow like a piece of art, attracting tourists and photographers alike.\n\nStaff at the station were polite and helpful, which made navigating the station and boarding the train easy and stress-free. The local connectivity from CSMT is also top-notch, with local trains, buses, taxis, and metros easily accessible.\n\nOverall, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus is more than just a transport hub – it’s a symbol of Mumbai’s spirit, history, and efficiency. I came away with not just travel memories but also deep admiration for this iconic landmark. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Mumbai – whether you’re catching a train or simply soaking in the architectural brilliance!"

This historic building served as Mahatma Gandhi’s residence and workspace whenever he was in Mumbai, and it played a significant role in India’s independence movement. Walking through the house, I could almost feel the weight of history—the place where Gandhi planned protests, led movements, and inspired millions.\n\nThe museum itself was well-organized, with photographs, letters, and artifacts that provided insight into his life and work. One of the highlights was the room where he stayed, preserved exactly as he left it, with his spinning wheel and personal belongings. The library was also impressive, containing a vast collection of books on Gandhi and his philosophy of nonviolence.\n\nWhat stood out the most was the quiet, reflective atmosphere. Despite being in the heart of bustling Mumbai, Mani Bhavan felt peaceful—a fitting tribute to a man who preached simplicity and peace. It’s a must-visit for anyone interested in history, offering a deeper understanding of Gandhi’s legacy and India’s struggle for independence."

With Gandhi ji, Mani Bhavan was at the forefront of freedom struggle.\nThree floors of Mani Bhavan has endless stories to tell. The ground floor is basically a library having a rich collection of books by and on Gandhiji apart from some mementos. First floor is pictorial journey to Gandhiji's life and events. There is also an auditorium on second floor but it was closed on the day of my visit. On the second floor is the room used by Gandhiji and it is supposedly preserved in it's original settings. There is a diorama gallery, 28 of them giving glimpses to his world. AND the Balcony, where he used to address, the balcony where you can feel his aura even today. The entry on terrace was not allowed on the day of my visit.\nWith it's abundance, I wonder, what will Mani Bhavan say if it could speak. Will it say something about the enthusiastic student who learnt carding here? Or may be about the scholar who started or took over weeklies and journals like Satyagrahi, Young India and Navjeevan. Or the story of its frustrated resident returning back from Second Round Table Conference. Or may be about Maa Bharti's favourite son's struggle for her freedom, the satyagrah against Rowlatt act, Indian Press Act, his decision to organise bonfire of foreign clothes or launch of civil disobedience movement.\nOr may be it will choose to stay silent, even about the apathy of our current generation. For my approximately two hour stay, Mani Bhavan had almost 50 visitors, hardly half a dozen of them were from India. For me, It's a MUST VISIT."
