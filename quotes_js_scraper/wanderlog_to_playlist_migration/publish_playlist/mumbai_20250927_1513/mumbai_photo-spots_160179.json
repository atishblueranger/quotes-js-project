The atmosphere was electric, with devotees bustling about, preparing for the grand celebrations the next day. As I walked through the premises, I could feel the palpable energy of devotion and service.\n\nBhagavad Gita Teachings\nThe spirit of preparation and service reminded me of the Bhagavad Gita's teachings on Karma Yoga, where Lord Krishna emphasizes the importance of selfless action and duty. The devotees' dedication to their tasks, whether it was decorating the temple or cooking for the crowds, was a testament to the power of Karma Yoga in action.\n\nSatvik Food Options\nISKCON Juhu offers several outlets serving delicious satvik food, which aligns perfectly with the Gita's emphasis on a sattvic diet that promotes spiritual growth and well-being. The food was not only tasty but also prepared with love and devotion, making it a truly satisfying experience.\n\nThandai on a Summer Day\nIf you're visiting ISKCON Juhu during the summer months, Thandai is an absolute must-try! This refreshing drink is perfect for beating the heat and rejuvenating your senses. The Thandai served at ISKCON Juhu is made with love and care, and its cooling properties will leave you feeling refreshed and revitalized.\n\nOverall Experience\nMy visit to ISKCON Juhu was a truly enriching experience. The atmosphere of devotion, the delicious satvik food, and the refreshing Thandai all combined to create a memorable experience. Whether you're a devotee or just looking for a unique cultural experience, ISKCON Juhu is definitely worth a visit.\n\nI would highly recommend ISKCON Juhu to anyone looking for a spiritual and cultural experience. The temple's emphasis on Bhagavad Gita teachings and its beautiful atmosphere make it a must-visit destination for anyone interested in spirituality and Indian culture.",

Although the church was under construction during my visit, I was still able to appreciate its stunning design and architecture.\n\nDespite the ongoing construction work, the church's design and architecture still shone through. I was particularly impressed by the blend of Gothic and Romanesque styles, which added to the church's unique charm.\n\nThe church's history and significance were also evident, and I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about its importance in the local community.\n\nMy only suggestion would be to plan your visit once the construction work is complete, as it would be wonderful to experience the church in all its glory.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend visiting the Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount, even if it's just to admire its stunning design and architecture. It's a truly special place that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",

Unfortunately when we were there the gateway was covered in scaffolding while it is being cleaned so not the best for photos but nevertheless an important place to learn about why the gateway was built and its history. Views of the nearby Taj Palace are also stunning from here. Would have loved to have been able to visit on an evening to see it lit up.",

            "text": "Sanjay Gandhi National Park Visit\n\nWe started 2025 with a trip to Sanjay Gandhi National Park on 1st January. The park opens at 8 AM, and although the ticket queue was long, it was worth the wait. Entry tickets were ₹110 per person, with car parking charged at ₹50 per hour.\n\nWe walked about 7 km, taking in the serene beauty of this lush green haven in the heart of Mumbai. The experience was delightful, with scenic mountains, dense trees, playful monkeys, and deer adding to the charm. The butterfly garden was another highlight, with pretty butterflies fluttering all around.\n\nThe tiger safari, bus fair at ₹136 per person, was an incredible adventure where we spotted tigers, cubs, and a lioness.\n\nUnfortunately, we missed the toy train ride as the lanes are currently under redevelopment, but we'll be back to try it on our next visit. With so much left to explore, it's clear the park can't be fully covered in a single day. We're already planning a revisit to experience more of this incredible destination.\n\nSanjay Gandhi National Park is a perfect weekend escape, offering a blend of nature and adventure. A must-visit for anyone looking to unwind and reconnect with the outdoors!",

The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya is a beautiful, thoughtfully curated museum full of art, culture, and history. From the moment we walked in, we were captivated.\n\nOne of the first things my daughters (ages 5 and 7) noticed was a Ganesha statue with its trunk damaged. They were distraught and full of questions. We later learned that this damage likely occurred centuries ago-possibly during the Portuguese colonial period, when soldiers used sculptures for target practice. It was a sad yet meaningful teaching moment, showing how even sacred art can be impacted by history. I appreciated that the museum preserves and presents these pieces with care and reverence.\n\nThe museum itself is stunning. I especially loved the Himalayan exhibit-it was peaceful and deeply moving. My daughters were thrilled to spin the prayer wheels and explore the Natural History section, which is full of birds and animals that had them absolutely elated. They also got to color their own artwork in the interactive art area, which was such a fun and creative touch.\n\nThis museum strikes a perfect balance-engaging for kids, enriching for adults, and beautifully maintained. We are so grateful to Raju for bringing us here. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Mumbai!",

            "text": "The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya is one of Mumbai's most iconic and well-preserved museums, housed in a stunning Indo-Saracenic building near the Gateway of India. Built in the early 20th century, the architecture itself is a heritage masterpiece with a grand dome and elegant galleries. The museum hosts over 50,000 artifacts spanning Indian and world history-ranging from Indus Valley relics, ancient sculptures, and miniature paintings to arms, textiles, and European art.\n\nKey highlights include the Sculpture Gallery, the renowned Miniature Art Gallery, and special international exhibits. There's also a natural history section and a children's gallery that appeal to families. Audio guides enhance the experience, and photography is permitted with a small fee. Facilities include a museum shop and café, though air conditioning and accessibility could be better in some areas.\n\nVisitors typically spend 2–3 hours exploring, and the museum is praised for its well-organized layout and rich cultural offerings. Despite minor maintenance issues or temporary gallery closures, the overall experience is memorable and educational. Ideal for history buffs, tourists, and locals alike, CSMVS stands as a cultural gem of Mumbai and a must-visit destination for anyone interested in India's rich heritage.",

The surroundings are aesthetically pleasing and spiritually significant.\n\nHowever, what deeply disappointed me was the complete lack of peace. Visitors were speaking loudly, some were playing music, and others were busy making reels-completely disregarding the sanctity of the place. It was chaotic and disrespectful.\n\nPeace Pagodas are meant for meditation, reflection, and inner calm-a truly beautiful concept. Unfortunately, the atmosphere here felt more like a social circus than a spiritual retreat.\n\nThe management seriously needs to step up and enforce some basic rules of silence and decorum. They could take inspiration from the Peace Pagoda in Nepal, where the environment is far more serene and respectfully maintained.",

The short boat ride itself felt refreshing, and after that, there was a road journey that added to the excitement. The road leading to the pagoda is surrounded by beautiful natural greenery on both sides. It is a peaceful stretch where you can enjoy the sights and sounds of nature, and traveling through this scenic route gives a very special kind of joy.\n\nOn reaching the pagoda, I was immediately impressed by its grand structure and calm surroundings. I also participated in a meditation session along with other visitors. Sitting quietly in the vast meditation hall, I felt a sense of deep peace and relaxation. The atmosphere was so serene that time passed without me even realizing it. It was an experience of true mental stillness, something that is rare to find in the busy life of the city.\n\nThe overall view of the place is equally breathtaking. The golden dome, the open surroundings, and the calm environment together create a perfect destination for anyone seeking peace of mind. I would highly recommend visiting the Global Vipassana Pagoda to experience meditation, tranquility, and the beauty of nature all at once.",

A must visit for art lovers to appreciate the art work. The entry is free, which was remarkable. Since they said not to click photographs or record videos I have very less videos or photos to show. One of the most prestigious venues for artists to display and showcase their work.",

I had been here around 10-12 years ago during my college days, and at that time, the garden was absolutely beautiful. It used to be very big, full of colorful flowers, well-maintained green grass, and spacious sitting areas - the whole atmosphere was so peaceful and fresh.\n\nBut now, most of the area has been reduced, there are very few flowers, and the green grass has almost disappeared. The beauty and charm which it had earlier is definitely missing now. I still remember how beautiful it used to be during my college days - full of greenery, colorful flowers, and spacious sitting areas. I miss that charm.\n\nGiving 4 stars only because of the memories attached to this place.😊",

            "text": "Visited: November 2024\n\nI'm an explorer who loves to visit historical and archaeological places, and Kanheri Caves was a real treat! Took a train to Borivali and then a shared auto for ₹25 to reach Sanjay Gandhi National Park. From there, I took the ₹20 shuttle bus that takes you straight to the caves. It's amazing how such a peaceful and serene spot exists in the middle of Mumbai!\n\nThe caves are well-maintained, and the history here is incredible. I was astonished by the big standing Buddha statue-it's both impressive and calming. The ancient water management system carved into the stone is fascinating-stone channels and cisterns designed to collect and guide rainwater. It's amazing how advanced the architecture was for its time.\n\nThe ancient monk cells were another highlight-small, carved-out rooms where monks once lived and meditated. Walking through them, you really feel the quiet, spiritual atmosphere of the place. It's like stepping back into a different time.\n\nI spent about 3 hours exploring every cave-be prepared for a lot of walking and stairs. Carry plenty of water, wear comfortable shoes, and take your time to appreciate the surroundings. There are plenty of shaded spots to rest, which definitely helps.\n\nA big thanks to the security guards-one of them saved me from an aggressive monkey and handed me his stick for protection. Beware of monkeys if you're carrying food-they're quick!\n\nTip: Go early to avoid the heat, keep your food sealed, and enjoy the peaceful vibe of this historical escape. It's definitely worth a visit.",

            "text": "Tucked away in the verdant precincts of Byculla's Rani Baug, the Dr. Bhau Daji Lad Museum stands as a monument to Mumbai's layered colonial and cultural past. It is the city's oldest museum, first conceived in 1855 and officially opened in 1872 under the name Victoria and Albert Museum, Bombay. In 1975, it was renamed in honor of Dr. Bhau Daji Lad-a physician, Sanskrit scholar, and the first Indian Sheriff of Mumbai-who played a key role in its establishment.\n\nThe museum's architecture is an exemplar of High Victorian design. The two-storied structure features Doric columns, intricate cast-iron railings, Minton tile flooring, chandeliers imported from England, and richly gilded moldings. Every inch of the interior is carefully ornamented in a harmonious palette of celadon green, ivory, and gold. The building was designed by George Birdwood, built by engineers Scott, McClelland & Co., and completed in 1871 after a nearly decade-long construction process.\n\nA major restoration project from 2003 to 2008, spearheaded by the Mumbai Municipal Corporation, INTACH, and the Jamnalal Bajaj Foundation, restored the building to its 19th-century brilliance. The project won the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Award of Excellence for Cultural Heritage Conservation in 2005. Another round of restoration concluded in 2025, focusing on structural stability, ceiling frescoes, and lighting enhancements, with a budget of approximately ₹3 crore.\n\nThe museum's collection is a meticulous archive of Mumbai's transformation from a cluster of fishing islands to a cosmopolitan metropolis. Its six main galleries house over 700 artifacts, ranging from 18th-century dioramas and clay models representing indigenous communities, to industrial arts such as silverware, Bidriware, lacquer work, and early ceramic styles produced in Bombay's colonial-era factories.\n\nA key attraction is the Origins of Mumbai Gallery, which features rare lithographs, maps from the 16th to 19th centuries, and photographs documenting the city's reclamation projects, dock expansion, and suburban rail networks. Another remarkable display is the massive basalt elephant sculpture from Elephanta Island, which stood at the museum's entrance for over a century before being relocated to the interior.\n\nThe museum also holds significant archival material on the founders of Bombay's civic identity, including Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy, Jaganath Shankarseth, Dr. George Buist, and of course, Dr. Bhau Daji Lad himself. Portraits, correspondence, medals, and minutes from civic meetings offer a glimpse into the city's philanthropic and intellectual roots.\n\nIn recent years, the museum has become a cultural hub. It organizes contemporary art exhibitions, heritage walks, documentary screenings, children's workshops, and public lectures. Collaborative projects with international museums have brought rare traveling exhibitions, including displays on Art Deco furniture, Indo-Saracenic design, and the architecture of modern Indian cities.\n\nOperational hours are from 10:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., Tuesday to Sunday, with a nominal entry fee ranging between ₹20 and ₹100. Audio guides in English, Hindi, and Marathi are available. The museum is easily accessible via Byculla Station, and its location within the historic Jijamata Udyan makes it a compelling day trip for families and researchers alike.\n\nThe museum's grandeur lies not just in its aesthetic majesty but in its careful accumulation of civic memory. Unlike larger national museums that often present sweeping narratives, the Bhau Daji Lad Museum excels in precise storytelling-through documents, materials, and crafts that trace the evolution of Bombay as a global port city.\n\nIn sum, this museum is both an architectural gem and an intellectual reservoir. It offers a uniquely Mumbai-centric lens into India's urban, artistic, and social history. It is not simply a museum to be visited, but a heritage space to be absorbed-quietly, slowly, and with respect for the depth it offers.",

The best time to visit is around 7:00 to 7:30 PM, just when the sun is setting and the sky turns into shades of orange and pink. The view of the Arabian Sea with the glowing sunset in the background looks absolutely magical. As the bridge curves gently over the water, the cool breeze and peaceful vibe make the drive unforgettable. It's clean, well-maintained, and gives a different kind of calmness even in the heart of a busy city like Mumbai.\n\nAs the sun sets and night begins, the entire Sea Link lights up, offering a completely different vibe. The beautifully lit cables and smooth road beneath the dark sky create a perfect blend of modern architecture and nature. Though bikes aren't allowed, the car drive itself is enough to enjoy the charm of this place. If you're ever in Mumbai, don't miss an evening or night drive on this iconic bridge-it feels like a scene from a movie. Truly, a peaceful escape in the middle of city chaos!",

Built in 1878 by architect Sir George Gilbert Scott, it was commissioned by businessman Premchand Roychand as a tribute to his mother, hence the name. For years, it was the city's tallest structure, at 285 feet. Rajabai Clock Tower has long been a beacon of the Oval Maidan precinct, a visual delight, and a valuable piece of history for the city. After brilliant restoration work by SNK Consultants, the clock tower was handed over to KSA Lighting Designers in 2017 for lighting the tower, the facade and the interiors of the University Library. Kanchan Puri, principal at the firm, tells us the process of this massive undertaking that was completed recently. After years of darkness, the Rajabai Clock Tower finally glowed up in 2021, literally.",

This historic building served as Mahatma Gandhi's residence and workspace whenever he was in Mumbai, and it played a significant role in India's independence movement. Walking through the house, I could almost feel the weight of history-the place where Gandhi planned protests, led movements, and inspired millions.\n\nThe museum itself was well-organized, with photographs, letters, and artifacts that provided insight into his life and work. One of the highlights was the room where he stayed, preserved exactly as he left it, with his spinning wheel and personal belongings. The library was also impressive, containing a vast collection of books on Gandhi and his philosophy of nonviolence.\n\nWhat stood out the most was the quiet, reflective atmosphere. Despite being in the heart of bustling Mumbai, Mani Bhavan felt peaceful-a fitting tribute to a man who preached simplicity and peace. It's a must-visit for anyone interested in history, offering a deeper understanding of Gandhi's legacy and India's struggle for independence.",

Fare for parking is ₹80 for 4 wheelers. We took the family booking and it costed us ₹100. You can carry phone cameras and there are no extra charge for it.
