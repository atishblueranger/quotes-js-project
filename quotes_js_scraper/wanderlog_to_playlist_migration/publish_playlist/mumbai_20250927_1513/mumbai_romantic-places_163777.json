I also visited Elephanta Caves which was very nice through ferry if you come to the Gate of India its a must try thing to take the ferry to Elephanta caves which comes at a cost of ₹290 per adult (above 12) and has going ferry cave vist inside and also coming back ferry ⛴️ it's best at weekend to come visit Mumbai because there is less traffic on road than on weekdays",

Unfortunately when we were there the gateway was covered in scaffolding while it is being cleaned so not the best for photos but nevertheless an important place to learn about why the gateway was built and its history. Views of the nearby Taj Palace are also stunning from here. Would have loved to have been able to visit on an evening to see it lit up.",

The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya is a beautiful, thoughtfully curated museum full of art, culture, and history. From the moment we walked in, we were captivated.\n\nOne of the first things my daughters (ages 5 and 7) noticed was a Ganesha statue with its trunk damaged. They were distraught and full of questions. We later learned that this damage likely occurred centuries ago-possibly during the Portuguese colonial period, when soldiers used sculptures for target practice. It was a sad yet meaningful teaching moment, showing how even sacred art can be impacted by history. I appreciated that the museum preserves and presents these pieces with care and reverence.\n\nThe museum itself is stunning. I especially loved the Himalayan exhibit-it was peaceful and deeply moving. My daughters were thrilled to spin the prayer wheels and explore the Natural History section, which is full of birds and animals that had them absolutely elated. They also got to color their own artwork in the interactive art area, which was such a fun and creative touch.\n\nThis museum strikes a perfect balance-engaging for kids, enriching for adults, and beautifully maintained. We are so grateful to Raju for bringing us here. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Mumbai!",

Built in the early 20th century, the architecture itself is a heritage masterpiece with a grand dome and elegant galleries. The museum hosts over 50,000 artifacts spanning Indian and world history-ranging from Indus Valley relics, ancient sculptures, and miniature paintings to arms, textiles, and European art.\n\nKey highlights include the Sculpture Gallery, the renowned Miniature Art Gallery, and special international exhibits. There's also a natural history section and a children's gallery that appeal to families. Audio guides enhance the experience, and photography is permitted with a small fee. Facilities include a museum shop and café, though air conditioning and accessibility could be better in some areas.\n\nVisitors typically spend 2–3 hours exploring, and the museum is praised for its well-organized layout and rich cultural offerings. Despite minor maintenance issues or temporary gallery closures, the overall experience is memorable and educational. Ideal for history buffs, tourists, and locals alike, CSMVS stands as a cultural gem of Mumbai and a must-visit destination for anyone interested in India's rich heritage.",

Although the church was under construction during my visit, I was still able to appreciate its stunning design and architecture.\n\nDespite the ongoing construction work, the church's design and architecture still shone through. I was particularly impressed by the blend of Gothic and Romanesque styles, which added to the church's unique charm.\n\nThe church's history and significance were also evident, and I appreciated the opportunity to learn more about its importance in the local community.\n\nMy only suggestion would be to plan your visit once the construction work is complete, as it would be wonderful to experience the church in all its glory.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend visiting the Basilica of Our Lady of the Mount, even if it's just to admire its stunning design and architecture. It's a truly special place that is sure to leave a lasting impression.",

During our recent visit, the beach was buzzing with people, yet it didn't take away from the fun and energy the place has to offer. Families, children, joggers, and food vendors fill the shore, making it one of the most happening spots in the city.\n\nWhat made our visit memorable was the boat ride we took. With life jackets on and the sea breeze hitting our faces, it was an exciting experience to ride the waves and enjoy the view of the coastline from the water. The boats aren't just for show-they give you a real feel of the sea, especially during sunset when the sky meets the ocean in beautiful shades of orange and pink.\n\nAnother fascinating part of Juhu Beach is the air traffic. Being close to the Mumbai airport, you can actually see flights flying just above the beach, extremely low and loud, which adds a dramatic touch to the experience. It's a surreal sight-waves crashing at your feet and planes roaring above your head.\n\nFrom camel rides to chaat stalls, Juhu has something for everyone. Whether you go for relaxation, food, or adventure, this beach captures the essence of Mumbai like no other.",

The surroundings are aesthetically pleasing and spiritually significant.\n\nHowever, what deeply disappointed me was the complete lack of peace.

It was chaotic and disrespectful.\n\nPeace Pagodas are meant for meditation, reflection, and inner calm-a truly beautiful concept. Unfortunately, the atmosphere here felt more like a social circus than a spiritual retreat.\n\nThe management seriously needs to step up and enforce some basic rules of silence and decorum. They could take inspiration from the Peace Pagoda in Nepal, where the environment is far more serene and respectfully maintained.",

The short boat ride itself felt refreshing, and after that, there was a road journey that added to the excitement. The road leading to the pagoda is surrounded by beautiful natural greenery on both sides. It is a peaceful stretch where you can enjoy the sights and sounds of nature, and traveling through this scenic route gives a very special kind of joy.\n\nOn reaching the pagoda, I was immediately impressed by its grand structure and calm surroundings. I also participated in a meditation session along with other visitors. Sitting quietly in the vast meditation hall, I felt a sense of deep peace and relaxation. The atmosphere was so serene that time passed without me even realizing it. It was an experience of true mental stillness, something that is rare to find in the busy life of the city.\n\nThe overall view of the place is equally breathtaking. The golden dome, the open surroundings, and the calm environment together create a perfect destination for anyone seeking peace of mind. I would highly recommend visiting the Global Vipassana Pagoda to experience meditation, tranquility, and the beauty of nature all at once.",

This spot has been featured in many Bollywood movies and web series, and when you stand there, you understand why. The calm breeze, sound of the waves, and wide-open sea - it just feels peaceful.\n\nThere's also a small garden-like area developed around the fort, which is clean and adds to the experience. Families, couples, and even photographers come here just to enjoy the vibe.\n\nHowever, I noticed there's some construction happening in the sea now - another bridge is being built.

The caves are home to stunning rock-cut temples that date back to the 6th century and are dedicated to Lord Shiva.\n\nThe main cave is an architectural masterpiece, featuring awe-inspiring sculptures like the giant Trimurti, a 20-foot-high statue depicting the three faces of Lord Shiva. The intricate carvings and serene atmosphere make it feel like you're stepping back in time. Don't forget to explore the smaller caves, which also offer fascinating artwork and carvings.\n\nThe island itself is peaceful, with lush greenery and beautiful views of the Arabian Sea, making it the perfect spot for a relaxing day away from the city's hustle and bustle. The hike up to the caves is a bit steep but totally worth it, and there are also toy trains available for a more comfortable ride.\n\n⏰ Timings: Open daily from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM\n💰 Entry Fees: ₹40 for Indian visitors, ₹600 for foreign nationals\n🚤 Boat Ride: Approx. ₹200-₹300 for a round trip\n📸 Photography: Allowed for free, but no tripods in certain areas\n\nWhether you're a history buff, photography enthusiast, or just someone looking to explore Mumbai's rich cultural heritage, Elephanta Caves is an unforgettable experience.

The journey involves a scenic boat ride to and from the cave site, which, although lengthy, is rewarding upon arrival. Safety measures are in place on the boats, including the provision of life jackets.\n\nBe prepared for long queues while boarding the ferry, especially during peak hours. It is advisable to carry essentials such as a cap or umbrella, drinking water, and sunscreen, as the area can be quite sunny and hot. Proper preparation will help ensure a more comfortable and enjoyable experience.\n\nThe ferry ride costs approximately ₹250 for a round trip. Upon arrival, visitors can either walk to the ticket counter or take a toy train, which costs around ₹10. The entry fee to the caves is about ₹40. You'll also find several small outlets selling refreshments, along with shops offering souvenirs such as magnets, bags, and unique antiques.\n\nIt's advisable to allocate at least 5–6 hours to fully explore the site and enjoy the experience at a relaxed pace. Conveniently located near the Gateway of India, this makes for a culturally rich and enjoyable day trip.",

The park opens at 8 AM, and although the ticket queue was long, it was worth the wait. Entry tickets were ₹110 per person, with car parking charged at ₹50 per hour.\n\nWe walked about 7 km, taking in the serene beauty of this lush green haven in the heart of Mumbai. The experience was delightful, with scenic mountains, dense trees, playful monkeys, and deer adding to the charm. The butterfly garden was another highlight, with pretty butterflies fluttering all around.\n\nThe tiger safari, bus fair at ₹136 per person, was an incredible adventure where we spotted tigers, cubs, and a lioness.\n\nUnfortunately, we missed the toy train ride as the lanes are currently under redevelopment, but we'll be back to try it on our next visit. With so much left to explore, it's clear the park can't be fully covered in a single day. We're already planning a revisit to experience more of this incredible destination.\n\nSanjay Gandhi National Park is a perfect weekend escape, offering a blend of nature and adventure. A must-visit for anyone looking to unwind and reconnect with the outdoors!",

Its 103 per person (enterance tickets to park) ...\nThen go for bus tickets immediately next to enterance ticket counter (instead of cycling in sunny i will recommend buy bus tickets)\nYou can use same tickets to traveling inside park ..it takes u up to kaneri caves and vice versa.. 50 rs per person is the tickets.\n\nAfter you rome cave .. go for museum then flower fragrance gardens (free entry) all r walkable 5 mins circle .\nDon't waste money in buying buggy or safari (means if you can walk and enjoy)\n\nSafaris if u want to see lion n tiger then only its useful .. unless its not worth as its waste of time (suggestions depends on personal thinking)\n\nSecondly be aware of monkeys don't feed to be to close to them\nBags water all r allowed to take inside. Camera(dslr) are bit checked for restrictions.\nOnce u get inside you wont find any water filler so carry it proper before treking.\n\nCarry plenty of water .. there r multiple caves. It takes 2-3 hr if u relax and rome each of them . Don't forget to go to view Point (its cave point watching view).\n\nCanteen is available but those r closed most of time.\n\nLike the review if you find it useful",

I had been here around 10-12 years ago during my college days, and at that time, the garden was absolutely beautiful. It used to be very big, full of colorful flowers, well-maintained green grass, and spacious sitting areas - the whole atmosphere was so peaceful and fresh.\n\nBut now, most of the area has been reduced, there are very few flowers, and the green grass has almost disappeared. The beauty and charm which it had earlier is definitely missing now. I still remember how beautiful it used to be during my college days - full of greenery, colorful flowers, and spacious sitting areas. I miss that charm.\n\nGiving 4 stars only because of the memories attached to this place.😊",

The entry was fully decorated with candles and the interiors were also decorated. The interiors were complimenting the lit candle or rather the other way round. The tickets were available at a minimal price of 1k ranging till the box seating. For this particular show the box seating was unavailable and all were placed on 3 levels. We bought a 1.5 k per person ticket and were placed on the first mezzanine level.  There was a second mezzanine floor which was a bit pricey. I would surely visit again if given a chance .

The location itself is a major highlight-sitting by the large windows, I was treated to a breathtaking view of the Arabian Sea, making it a perfect spot to enjoy a meal while watching the sunset or the bustling promenade.\n\nI ordered their Chef's Special Pizza, and it was truly exceptional. The pizza boasted a perfectly crisp thin crust, topped generously with fresh ingredients that balanced flavor and texture beautifully. The cheese was rich and gooey, while the toppings-an enticing mix of vegetables and meats-were well-seasoned and thoughtfully paired. Every bite reflected quality and culinary expertise.\n\nBeyond the food, the ambiance was relaxed yet sophisticated, ideal for both casual outings and special occasions. The staff was courteous and attentive, ensuring a pleasant dining experience from start to finish.\n\nOverall, Pizza By the Bay offers more than just great food; it's the combination of delectable pizzas, impeccable service, and the stunning Marine Drive view that makes it a must-visit. I highly recommend it for anyone looking to savor delicious food with an unforgettable backdrop.",

The food is exceptional.\n\nHowever, the service was 10-star.\n\nSome context: I am (un)fortunate to belong to a family of hoteliers, which makes dining with them anywhere an Olympic sport. They are quite critical of poor, or even mediocre, service, and it is a pain to hear long stories about how \"I have spent 40 years in the hotel industry...\" each time some minor thing doesn't meet their standards.\n\nTherefore, when I say the service was so good that my very exacting family were bowled over by the attention, the service, the speed, the efficiency, and all the other adjectives one can attach to great hospitality service.\n\nThe Table restaurant manager and his crew were exception. Warm, welcoming to begin with. Considerate of our dietary restrictions. Made appropriate recommendations so that we could have an excellent experience. It was the whole bag.\n\nSuffice to say, you'll always be guaranteed good food at a top notch restaurant. But great service like this is unique to The Table.",

The view of the Arabian Sea with the glowing sunset in the background looks absolutely magical. As the bridge curves gently over the water, the cool breeze and peaceful vibe make the drive unforgettable. It's clean, well-maintained, and gives a different kind of calmness even in the heart of a busy city like Mumbai.\n\nAs the sun sets and night begins, the entire Sea Link lights up, offering a completely different vibe. The beautifully lit cables and smooth road beneath the dark sky create a perfect blend of modern architecture and nature. Though bikes aren't allowed, the car drive itself is enough to enjoy the charm of this place.

However, with the manager's intervention, we were allocated two rather awkward seats with a poor view. Thankfully, our waiter assisted us in shifting to better seats after we requested.\n\nThe mocktails were delightful, and the prawns were scrumptious, but the chicken dish fell short of our expectations. Additionally, the service was sluggish, and we noticed that the bill included a drink that was never served to us.\n\nDespite these issues, we thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance.

Our server was really nice too but I think he needs to be a bit louder when he speaks (northeastern one) sorry if I assumed wrong.\n\nThe only ick about this place was the service charge but you get a discount if you pay through Zomato app to escape those charges which came around ₹177 for us so a ₹150 off on the bill isn't bad. Overall I rate this place a 4/5.💕",

Visitors eating, drinking and enjoying with families.\nThrowing back residue of their edibles, garbage disposal every where.. very painful..no civics sens.\nPlace was beautiful.\nFood items available at reasonable prices.",

And if u buy anything from the vendors buy from the vendor who is at the beginning of the hill not on the top. They charge u way more but if u want to contribute more to them as they work more climbing their way up and strive to earn surely help them. Going from a ferry to reach and getting a toy train. It was a good experience until we had to face monkeys 🤣🤣 be safe as the monkeys are in 100s they will steal whatever u have in ur hand to eat. I had a bottle of water and chased me finally i handed it over like I surrendered to the monkey. And while on the ferry we saw a dolphin too if u r lucky u will see one. A lot of seagulls trying to get food from u. Make sure to enjoy all of this and be safe from monkeys.",
