One small tea shop is there opposite to fort, no other hotels or canteens near by., closing time is 5.00 pm you may stay up to 5.30 or 6.00 pm in some days. Raja fort is converted to museum and rani fort is empty . Rainwater harvesting pond from mountain is a very beautiful place and some remnants of statues and old buildings also there. Apart from fort\n• Temple outside the fort\n•The fort entrance\n• The hill\n•The scaffold at the top of the hill\nCan be viewed. Overall a must visit place for history lovers."

The Tirupati  city is built around this temple. It is believed that during invasion of Govindaraja Perumal Temple in Chidambaram, the Utsava murti (processional deity) was brought to Tirupati for safe keeping. The Utsava murti was taken back after the invasions.\nGovindaraja Temple was consecrated in the year 1130 AD by saint Ramanuja. However, there are structures inside the temple complex which belong to 9th and 10th centuries. Before Govindaraja was consecrated as the presiding deity, another form of Vishnu - Parthasarathy enjoyed that honour. Kotturu, a village at the foot of Tirumala hills, was moved to the vicinity of Govindaraja Temple which was later merged into city of Tirupati.\nThe temple is one of the largest temple complexes in Andhra Pradesh.The temple at present is being administered by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams and follows the vaikhanasa thenkalai mode of worship."

The atmosphere inside is calm and serene, providing a perfect setting for peaceful prayer and reflection. The architecture of the temple is impressive, with towering gopurams and intricate carvings that tell stories from ancient scriptures.\n\nOne of the best aspects is that mobile phones are not allowed inside, which really enhances the spiritual experience. A free and secure mobile deposit counter is available near the entrance, so you can focus fully on your darshan without distractions.\n\nAs soon as you enter the temple street, it feels like a festival – with plenty of shops selling flowers, prasadam, fruits, toys, and devotional items. It’s a vibrant, colorful area full of energy and devotion.\n\nThe darshan of Lord Govindaraja is absolutely mesmerizing – His majestic idol captivates your heart and mind instantly. Don't miss the free anadhanam (meal service) offered at around 1 PM – it’s well-organized and serves tasty food to hundreds of devotees daily.\n\nOverall, Sri Govindaraja Swamy Temple is a must-visit – not just for its religious importance, but for the unique blend of spiritual bliss, culture, and tradition it offers. A highly recommended experience in Tirupati!"

Was surprised shocked to know that such a old, wonderful ancient temple with rich history is there.\n\nStarted gathering details and started planning to visit this temple, but for some reason could not sleep, pure guilt or shame that we haven't visited such a wonderful temple for all these years.\n\nSo without wasting any further time, we decided to visit the temple come what may. Next day early morning around 4 am started from chennai. Drive was ok up to thiruvallur but after that it was really crap. Can you believe such a important temple but it is just connected with a single lane highway from chennai.\n\nSome how managed to reach the temple, and as expected it was very very tough to find a parking space, since there is no designated parking area for this temple.\n\nNO MOBILE PHONES ARE ALLOWED INSIDE THE TEMPLE, hence we had to handover the mobile phones in the designated counter. No idea why, we were told to buy special Que ticket of 20rs but there was no special Que at all. Crowd management was very poor to say the least.\n\nWe went in and as we saw Govindarajaswamy in lying posture, we were totally over joyed, didn't even think of praying, just wanted to keep on looking at the lord. wow wow wow.\n\nTemple constructed somewhere in the 10th century. They say the urchava murthy came from chidambaram temple and then returned back to chidambaram after few years. They say that Ramanujar installed the idol and did the initial pooja's. Kindly read the temple history as you come out of the temple.\n\nFelt so happy that we were able to visit this wonderful temple finally. Temple faces east, Lord Govindaraja swamy faces east. Beautiful Rajagopuram faces east. Before we finish our small review want to quote a pasuram from divya prabhadham\n\nஊனேறு செல்வத் துடற்பிறவி யான்வேண்டேன்\nஆனேறேழ் வென்றா னடிமைத் திறமல்லால்\nகூனேறு சங்க மிடத்தான்தன் வேங்கடத்து\nகோனேரி வாழும் குருகாய்ப் பிறப்பேனே"

Once gate opens, you will literally experience an auto race, whoever goes first, they will be in the ticket counter ( which is at the beginning of the steps). A must visit steps if you are going to Tirumala. People with heart desease, asthma are suggested to go via bus to Tirumala. People having kids <12 years can go between 6am and 2pm only ( due to safety reasons)."

The serenity of the hills, combined with the spiritual atmosphere, made the journey incredibly fulfilling.\n\nI took one of the two main footpaths leading to the sacred Tirumala temple. Interestingly, the path I chose had very few shops or rest points, allowing for a quiet and focused ascent — just me, the steps, and the surrounding nature. It felt like a truly personal and meditative journey.\n\nOn a previous visit, I had taken the other route, which is lined with shops and stalls selling snacks, drinks, and devotional items. That path is lively and more commercial, offering plenty of opportunities to rest, eat, and shop along the way. While both paths lead to the same divine destination, the experiences they offer are quite different.\n\nWhether you're seeking a quiet, spiritual trek or a more vibrant and social climb, Tirumala has something for everyone. For me, this recent climb without distractions gave a deep sense of peace and connection — an experience I’d highly recommend to anyone visiting the holy hills."

This temple is dedicated to Lord Hanuman, also known as Anjaneya Swamy, and holds significant importance in the Vaishnavite tradition.\n\nLegend and Significance:\n\nAccording to legend, young Hanuman wished to leave Tirumala in search of a camel. To prevent this, his mother, Anjana Devi, bound his hands with cuffs (\"Bedi\") and instructed him to remain there until her return. Obediently, Hanuman stayed, and the temple's idol depicts him in this unique handcuffed posture, symbolizing devotion and obedience.\n\nTemple Rituals:\n\nDaily rituals include the offering of 'naivedyam' (sacred food) to Lord Venkateswara and Sri Bhu Varaha Swamy, which is subsequently presented to Lord Anjaneya at this temple. Every Sunday, an 'Abhishekam' (ritualistic bath) is performed for the deity, with a special 'Abhishekam' conducted annually on Hanuman Jayanti.\n\nVisiting Hours:\n\nThe temple is open daily from 5:30 AM to 9:00 PM, allowing devotees ample time to offer their prayers and seek blessings.\n\nA visit to the Sri Bedi Anjaneya Swamy Temple is considered an integral part of the pilgrimage to Tirumala, offering devotees a chance to reflect on the virtues of devotion and obedience exemplified by Lord Hanuman."

Kalyanotsavam (a celebratory ritual) is held daily and is believed to bestow blessings for happy marriages and life partnerships.\n\nOriginally dating back centuries, the temple was revitalized in the 16th century by Tallapaka Chinna Tirumala Acharya, the grandson of the saint-poet Annamacharya. Since 1967, it has been administered by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) and is also recognized as a centrally protected archaeological monument.\n\nAnnual celebrations like Brahmotsavams and Sakshatkara Vaibhavam are grandly observed here. For instance, Brahmotsavams feature vibrant traditions like Dhwajarohanam (flag hoisting), Anna Prasadam distribution, and cultural programs.\n\nDarshan timings: The temple welcomes devotees from early morning (around 5:30 AM) till evening (7:30 PM), with short intervals .\n\nSevas (rituals) are offered at structured timings—like Suprabatham (5 AM), Kalyanotsavam (11 AM), Arjita Brahmotsavam (12:30 PM), and Ekantha Seva (8 PM)—with most services priced modestly (₹10 to ₹500). .\n\nEasily accessible by frequent APSRTC buses from Tirupati, travel time is approximately 25–30 minutes.\n\nLast but not least, the Prasadam-Dadojjana whish is made of rice and cow milk curd base, balanced by gentle warmth of pepper and ginger, makes it perfect after darshan."

The train schedule was easy to find and the boarding process was quick and efficient. The station also had a variety of food and beverage options, although some of the shops could use a bit of updating. The selection of souvenirs and travel essentials was limited, but overall, the station provided a positive experience. However, there were some areas that could use a little more attention to cleanliness, such as the restrooms and the floors in the main concourse."

With trains operating 24/7, the station is constantly buzzing with activity, and it remains crowded at all hours—something regular travelers quickly get used to.\n\nWhat makes this station especially convenient is its location. The main bus stand is just about 50 meters away, making onward travel easy and efficient. Additionally, there are plenty of local autos and jeeps available right outside, ensuring that you can continue your journey without any hassle. Whether you're a pilgrim or a regular commuter, Tirupati Railway Station does a commendable job of handling the heavy footfall."

It operates more like a regional domestic airport, with limited facilities and a small footprint.\n\nThe airport opens around 5:30 AM, which is important to note if you have an early flight or are planning to reach too soon—it won't be accessible before that time. There's limited seating inside and minimal food or shopping options, so don’t expect lounges or big food courts. Security and check-in are relatively quick due to the low passenger volume, but that also means services can feel sparse.\n\nTransport options are limited too—make sure you’ve arranged your taxi or pick-up in advance, especially if you're arriving early or late. On the plus side, the airport staff is generally courteous and the place is clean.\n\nTips:\n\nReach closer to your flight time; no need to come too early.\n\nCarry snacks or essentials, as shops are limited.\n\nDon’t expect international-level facilities—manage expectation"

It is situated just a short drive from the heart of Tirupati, making it highly convenient for those arriving or departing.\n\nTerminal & Facilities: The terminal is modern, and though not as large as some of the major international airports, it is well-maintained and has a clean, organized layout. There are sufficient check-in counters, security checks, and immigration counters, making the process relatively smooth. The waiting areas are spacious and comfortable, with enough seating available.\n\nFood & Shopping: There are a few cafes and eateries inside the terminal, offering a basic range of snacks and beverages. While there is a limited selection compared to bigger airports, it's enough for a short waiting period. There are also a couple of duty-free shops, selling local souvenirs and essentials, though the product variety is a bit restricted.\n\nWi-Fi & Connectivity: The free Wi-Fi service provided by the airport is decent, although speeds could be improved during peak hours. There's mobile network coverage throughout the terminal, making it easy to stay connected.\n\nTransport: The airport has good connections to local transportation options such as taxis, private cabs, and buses. There are also ample parking facilities for both short and long-term parking.\n\nCustomer Service: Staff at the airport were generally helpful and polite, although at times, the queues for check-in and security could get a little long, especially during peak travel hours. The airport staff were mostly efficient but could benefit from more training for smoother operations.\n\nOverall Experience: For a regional airport, Tirupati International offers a comfortable and efficient travel experience. It’s a great option for pilgrims visiting the Tirumala temple or those traveling within South India. The airport could improve on food variety, shopping options, and speed during peak hours, but overall, it's a convenient, well-organized facility with a friendly atmosphere."

You better go by a cab or auto as round trip and ask the driver to wait to pick you up. One small tea shop is there opposite to fort, no other hotels or canteens near by., closing time is 5.00 pm you may stay up to 5.30 or 6.00 pm in some days. Raja fort is converted to museum and rani fort is empty . Rainwater harvesting pond from mountain is a very beautiful place and some remnants of statues and old buildings also there. Apart from fort\n• Temple outside the fort\n•The fort entrance\n• The hill\n•The scaffold at the top of the hill\nCan be viewed. Overall a must visit place for history lovers."

This reserve is a hidden gem along the footpath, offering a serene and picturesque view amidst the challenging climb.\n\nThe park is home to a variety of deer, which can often be seen grazing peacefully in their natural habitat. The sight of these graceful animals, set against the lush green backdrop of the forest, adds a tranquil and refreshing break to the journey. However, it's important to note that there have been reports of leopard sightings and even some incidents in the area. While the presence of these wild animals underscores the natural, untamed beauty of the forest, it also serves as a reminder to remain vigilant and cautious during the trek.\n\nWhether you’re an animal lover or simply looking to enjoy the natural beauty of Tirumala, the Deer Park Reserve is a delightful spot that enriches the journey to the temple. It’s a peaceful reminder of the harmony between nature and spirituality that defines the Tirumala experience, with the added excitement of being in a truly wild environment."

The Tirupati  city is built around this temple. It is believed that during invasion of Govindaraja Perumal Temple in Chidambaram, the Utsava murti (processional deity) was brought to Tirupati for safe keeping. The Utsava murti was taken back after the invasions.\nGovindaraja Temple was consecrated in the year 1130 AD by saint Ramanuja. However, there are structures inside the temple complex which belong to 9th and 10th centuries. Before Govindaraja was consecrated as the presiding deity, another form of Vishnu - Parthasarathy enjoyed that honour. Kotturu, a village at the foot of Tirumala hills, was moved to the vicinity of Govindaraja Temple which was later merged into city of Tirupati.\nThe temple is one of the largest temple complexes in Andhra Pradesh.The temple at present is being administered by Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams and follows the vaikhanasa thenkalai mode of worship."

Located within a walkable distance from Tirupati Railway Station, this temple is easily accessible and ideal for those arriving by train.\n\nDedicated to Lord Govindaraja, who is believed to be the elder brother of Lord Venkateswara, the temple holds immense spiritual significance. The atmosphere inside is calm and serene, providing a perfect setting for peaceful prayer and reflection. The architecture of the temple is impressive, with towering gopurams and intricate carvings that tell stories from ancient scriptures.\n\nOne of the best aspects is that mobile phones are not allowed inside, which really enhances the spiritual experience. A free and secure mobile deposit counter is available near the entrance, so you can focus fully on your darshan without distractions.\n\nAs soon as you enter the temple street, it feels like a festival – with plenty of shops selling flowers, prasadam, fruits, toys, and devotional items. It’s a vibrant, colorful area full of energy and devotion.\n\nThe darshan of Lord Govindaraja is absolutely mesmerizing – His majestic idol captivates your heart and mind instantly. Don't miss the free anadhanam (meal service) offered at around 1 PM – it’s well-organized and serves tasty food to hundreds of devotees daily.\n\nOverall, Sri Govindaraja Swamy Temple is a must-visit – not just for its religious importance, but for the unique blend of spiritual bliss, culture, and tradition it offers. A highly recommended experience in Tirupati!"

Was surprised shocked to know that such a old, wonderful ancient temple with rich history is there.\n\nStarted gathering details and started planning to visit this temple, but for some reason could not sleep, pure guilt or shame that we haven't visited such a wonderful temple for all these years.\n\nSo without wasting any further time, we decided to visit the temple come what may. Next day early morning around 4 am started from chennai. Drive was ok up to thiruvallur but after that it was really crap. Can you believe such a important temple but it is just connected with a single lane highway from chennai.\n\nSome how managed to reach the temple, and as expected it was very very tough to find a parking space, since there is no designated parking area for this temple.\n\nNO MOBILE PHONES ARE ALLOWED INSIDE THE TEMPLE, hence we had to handover the mobile phones in the designated counter. No idea why, we were told to buy special Que ticket of 20rs but there was no special Que at all. Crowd management was very poor to say the least.\n\nWe went in and as we saw Govindarajaswamy in lying posture, we were totally over joyed, didn't even think of praying, just wanted to keep on looking at the lord. wow wow wow.\n\nTemple constructed somewhere in the 10th century. They say the urchava murthy came from chidambaram temple and then returned back to chidambaram after few years. They say that Ramanujar installed the idol and did the initial pooja's. Kindly read the temple history as you come out of the temple.\n\nFelt so happy that we were able to visit this wonderful temple finally. Temple faces east, Lord Govindaraja swamy faces east. Beautiful Rajagopuram faces east. Before we finish our small review want to quote a pasuram from divya prabhadham\n\nஊனேறு செல்வத் துடற்பிறவி யான்வேண்டேன்\nஆனேறேழ் வென்றா னடிமைத் திறமல்லால்\nகூனேறு சங்க மிடத்தான்தன் வேங்கடத்து\nகோனேரி வாழும் குருகாய்ப் பிறப்பேனே"

Please note the animals in the zoo are very minimal, looks like a decade ago it had but not anymore.\n\nWorth visiting? If someone is ok to spend 75/- per person and 750 for a car even with limited animals then they can go, else I wouldn’t recommend.\n\nThere are lots of stalls that are available for snacks, water and cool-drinks."

They maintained it really well and supportive staff.\n\n5 Stars for below options\na. Option to use own car inside l, if reqd driver will be available (ofcourse you have to pay )\nb. Option to leverage battery car 🚗\nc. Option to opt for Battery two wheeler, this is brilliant move from team bcoz it gives us very special time and can enjoy every bit. KUDOS TO ZOO TEAM.\n\nOverall its the best zoo in my view, although it has little less species its still fine 🙂"

About 3–4 km from the city center, this is Tirupati’s only Shiva temple, and it’s nestled almost directly under a majestic waterfall that cascades into a temple tank—truly a rare sight  .\n\nThe sacred Kapileshwara Swamy idol is believed to be self-manifested and installed by Kapila Muni, making the temple historically and mythologically significant. A grand Nandi statue greets you at the entrance, and the temple complex also includes several sub-shrines for deities like Vinayaka, Subramanya, Kamakshi, and Krishna  .\n\nThe waterfall is the highlight—especially during monsoon and early winter (June to December), when the flow is powerful yet serene. The roar of water, lush greenery, and cool pond make for a meditative, cleansing atmosphere. Devotees often take a holy dip here, believed to absolve sins and bring blessings  .\n\nThe temple is managed by TTD, well-maintained, and operational from early morning until evening. Entry is free, and you can participate in sevas like Abhishekam, Archana, and Ekantha Seva for a nominal fee. Facilities include clean restrooms, changing rooms, and a cloak area for footwear—making it comfortable for pilgrims  .\n\nThe best times to visit are early morning (6–8 AM) or late afternoon (4–6 PM) for  pleasant weather, and beautiful lighting for photographs. If you’re there during major festivals like Brahmotsavam, Maha Shivaratri, or Kartika Purnima, expect vibrant rituals and a lively devotional atmosphere ."

The waterfall is situated in the middle of a dense forest and is a popular tourist destination in the region.\n\nThe waterfall is formed by the Kapila River which originates in the nearby hills. The water cascades down a height of about 100 feet into a small pond at the bottom, creating a stunning sight. The pool at the bottom is also a popular spot for tourists to take a dip and relax.\n\nKapila Teertham is also considered a sacred site by many Hindus and is believed to have mythological significance. According to legend, the sage Kapila performed penance at this spot, and the waterfall is named after him. Many pilgrims visit the waterfall to take a holy dip in the pool and offer prayers at the nearby temple.\n\nThe best time to visit Kapila Teertham is during the monsoon season (July to October), when the waterfall is at its full flow and the surrounding forest is lush green. However, it's important to exercise caution while visiting during the monsoon season, as the roads leading to the waterfall can be slippery and dangerous.\n\nOverall, Kapila Teertham is a must-visit destination for nature lovers, adventure enthusiasts, and spiritual seekers alike."

              "reviewText": "Sri Bedi Anjaneya Swamy Temple is a revered shrine located directly opposite the main entrance (Maha Dwaram) of the Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple in Tirumala. This temple is dedicated to Lord Hanuman, also known as Anjaneya Swamy, and holds significant importance in the Vaishnavite tradition.\n\nLegend and Significance:\n\nAccording to legend, young Hanuman wished to leave Tirumala in search of a camel. To prevent this, his mother, Anjana Devi, bound his hands with cuffs (\"Bedi\") and instructed him to remain there until her return. Obediently, Hanuman stayed, and the temple's idol depicts him in this unique handcuffed posture, symbolizing devotion and obedience.\n\nTemple Rituals:\n\nDaily rituals include the offering of 'naivedyam' (sacred food) to Lord Venkateswara and Sri Bhu Varaha Swamy, which is subsequently presented to Lord Anjaneya at this temple. Every Sunday, an 'Abhishekam' (ritualistic bath) is performed for the deity, with a special 'Abhishekam' conducted annually on Hanuman Jayanti.\n\nVisiting Hours:\n\nThe temple is open daily from 5:30 AM to 9:00 PM, allowing devotees ample time to offer their prayers and seek blessings.\n\nA visit to the Sri Bedi Anjaneya Swamy Temple is considered an integral part of the pilgrimage to Tirumala, offering devotees a chance to reflect on the virtues of devotion and obedience exemplified by Lord Hanuman."

Kalyanotsavam (a celebratory ritual) is held daily and is believed to bestow blessings for happy marriages and life partnerships.\n\nOriginally dating back centuries, the temple was revitalized in the 16th century by Tallapaka Chinna Tirumala Acharya, the grandson of the saint-poet Annamacharya. Since 1967, it has been administered by the Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams (TTD) and is also recognized as a centrally protected archaeological monument.\n\nAnnual celebrations like Brahmotsavams and Sakshatkara Vaibhavam are grandly observed here. For instance, Brahmotsavams feature vibrant traditions like Dhwajarohanam (flag hoisting), Anna Prasadam distribution, and cultural programs.\n\nDarshan timings: The temple welcomes devotees from early morning (around 5:30 AM) till evening (7:30 PM), with short intervals .\n\nSevas (rituals) are offered at structured timings—like Suprabatham (5 AM), Kalyanotsavam (11 AM), Arjita Brahmotsavam (12:30 PM), and Ekantha Seva (8 PM)—with most services priced modestly (₹10 to ₹500). .\n\nEasily accessible by frequent APSRTC buses from Tirupati, travel time is approximately 25–30 minutes.\n\nLast but not least, the Prasadam-Dadojjana whish is made of rice and cow milk curd base, balanced by gentle warmth of pepper and ginger, makes it perfect after darshan."

The waterfall is situated in the middle of a dense forest and is a popular tourist destination in the region.\n\nThe waterfall is formed by the Kapila River which originates in the nearby hills. The water cascades down a height of about 100 feet into a small pond at the bottom, creating a stunning sight. The pool at the bottom is also a popular spot for tourists to take a dip and relax.\n\nKapila Teertham is also considered a sacred site by many Hindus and is believed to have mythological significance. According to legend, the sage Kapila performed penance at this spot, and the waterfall is named after him. Many pilgrims visit the waterfall to take a holy dip in the pool and offer prayers at the nearby temple.\n\nThe best time to visit Kapila Teertham is during the monsoon season (July to October), when the waterfall is at its full flow and the surrounding forest is lush green. However, it's important to exercise caution while visiting during the monsoon season, as the roads leading to the waterfall can be slippery and dangerous.\n\nOverall, Kapila Teertham is a must-visit destination for nature lovers, adventure enthusiasts, and spiritual seekers alike."

About 3–4 km from the city center, this is Tirupati’s only Shiva temple, and it’s nestled almost directly under a majestic waterfall that cascades into a temple tank—truly a rare sight  .\n\nThe sacred Kapileshwara Swamy idol is believed to be self-manifested and installed by Kapila Muni, making the temple historically and mythologically significant. A grand Nandi statue greets you at the entrance, and the temple complex also includes several sub-shrines for deities like Vinayaka, Subramanya, Kamakshi, and Krishna  .\n\nThe waterfall is the highlight—especially during monsoon and early winter (June to December), when the flow is powerful yet serene. The roar of water, lush greenery, and cool pond make for a meditative, cleansing atmosphere. Devotees often take a holy dip here, believed to absolve sins and bring blessings  .\n\nThe temple is managed by TTD, well-maintained, and operational from early morning until evening. Entry is free, and you can participate in sevas like Abhishekam, Archana, and Ekantha Seva for a nominal fee. Facilities include clean restrooms, changing rooms, and a cloak area for footwear—making it comfortable for pilgrims  .\n\nThe best times to visit are early morning (6–8 AM) or late afternoon (4–6 PM) for  pleasant weather, and beautiful lighting for photographs. If you’re there during major festivals like Brahmotsavam, Maha Shivaratri, or Kartika Purnima, expect vibrant rituals and a lively devotional atmosphere ."
