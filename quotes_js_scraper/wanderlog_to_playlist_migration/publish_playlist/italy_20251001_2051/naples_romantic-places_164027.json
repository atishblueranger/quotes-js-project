The place itself it's already great, but when you listen to the explanations of the history of the place by the tour guides, and then you walk through the narrow tunnels and water basins, it really gives you a sense of how amazing this place is, and how genius/brave ancient Greeks and Romans were. For me, if you're in Napoli, it's a must.\n\nPd: if you're claustrophobic, keep in mind that there's an extremely narrow tunnel (80cm wide for the most part, but one very small part is around 50cm) which is like 80m long, and another one like that but pretty short, maybe 15-20m long. However, it never feels too enclosed due to the sound of water close by, and the fact that the rest of the place is pretty big (very high ceilings and wide spaces).",

The paths they let you take that are so narrow that I had to walk sideways. Though not required.\nSo amazing to see the water system that served the city for generations.  There are many stairs to get in and out. But a little cooler down there makes it a little easier to do.\nThe WWII history involved with these tunnels is amazing. Such a fascinating place!

Limited seating, so be prepared to stand in the heat.\n\nOverall, go and experience this very special and ancient site. Touch the buildings, walk on the streets, and feel the history!",

On the way to the ruins, the bus came on time. On the way back, though, it was delayed like 20min from the official pick up time and we got there before that so we waited a long time. Our main worry was that we tried calling the emergency number, after 15min, like 5 times and no one answered. But at least, after the bus came the guide apologised for the delay by blaming thw traffic.\nFrom the buss station where we were dropped off we walked another 10min to reach the ruins. There you need to buy tickets to visit. They also have small storage boxes which are free of charge. Caution though, big backpacks may not fit especially if they're loaded.\nThe ruins were a very cool and unique experience, we wanted to take our time and didn't go with a guide. What we thought was unnecessary, was the only one way in and out of that place when other options were closed off to the public.",

The level of preservation here is unreal-second stories still standing, wooden doors, roof beams, furniture, even food remnants. It's like the eruption happened yesterday.\n\nWe did a private tour with an archaeologist (highly recommend!) who helped bring it all to life-explaining how this seaside town functioned before the eruption and why it was preserved so differently from Pompeii. The contrast between the two sites is fascinating.\n\nIt's more compact than Pompeii, but every corner is packed with detail and history. And the best part? It's not swarming with tourists, so you can really take your time and soak it all in.\n\nDon't skip this one-Herculaneum is a must. Quiet, powerful, and unforgettable.",

There are some fun tight tunnels to squeeze through but if you cant manage it there are short cuts the tour guide can lead you through. I was always last taking photos so was chosen to be 'tail end charlie' to always confirm everyone was through the small tunnels. Best tourist catacombs tour out of the 4 I did.",

They are open for dinner at 19:00 sharp, but many guests had made a line at the opening time, which means you would not have seats if you come later than opening time. Since your pizza comes promptly after your order, most guests stay roughly 30 min. only, huge queue is not always long time. Your table will be assigned with table number at the entrance. English menu is available.\n\nYou can choose from wide range of classical and their original Pizza, which is fan, but you cannot enjoy many types because the size is large! Their original tomato sauce is tasty and bread part of the pizza is smooth to eat (a bit salty). The famous fried pizza has a unique shape and good taste but inside cheese may knock out you if you don't share it with other members.\nThe staff is friendly and will recommend you a suitable wine as well. Must visit.\n\nSmall caution. Staff may say “Service fee is not included” but you can consider that table charge is actually charged!",

The interior is spacious and keeps an authentic, slightly old-school charm that adds to the local feel.\n\nAnd the pizza was incredible.\nThe tomato sauce was rich and flavorful, the mozzarella was perfect, but the highlight was the beautifully leopard-spotted dough - soft, chewy, and full of character. The portion size was huge (even larger than the plate!), and for the price, it's an amazing deal.\n\nThe inside is also pleasantly cool - a huge plus on a hot Neapolitan day - though it does make the mozzarella firm up a little faster. One thing I missed was a house wine option; it would've complemented the meal perfectly.\n\nBottom line: a must-try spot in Naples.",

There are only seatings indoors and quite tight.\n\nThere are only 4 pizza choices: Marinara, Cossoca, Margharita and Marita (combo of marinara and margharita). Very reasonably riced at 6 euros a piece.\n\nSimple drinks menu(not a lot) but this makes it different from the others because they sell simple, no frills, hand made Italian pizzas.\n\nStaffs were helpful, and pizza sizes only come in 1 size… big!  The plate it comes out with although already large, still the pizza is larger! The pizza sauces were delicious and generous and the crust thin. With the size of pizza, you will never ever come out of the restaurant hungry, you probably won't eat anything for the rest of the day!\n\nIt's a good social place, there's are pictures of celebrities like Jude Law and Julia Roberts and others hanging off the wall.\n\nPram and wheelchair a bit tight and has steps, so maybe stay in the ground floor seatings.\n\nThe place was just heaving around lunchtime queuing to come in so come early.\n\nDef a must when in Napoli.",

I suggest buying ahead of time because slots are limited and you may end up having to come back later. They have tours in Italian and English. Our tour guide was amazing and answered any questions anyone had.\nThe catacombs were super interesting and full of history. Unfortunately there is no photography inside the catacombs (although clearly people don't follow the rules as you can see in the other reviews) so I don't have many pictures to share but it's worth seeing in person!",

From 1734, Charles of Bourbon made the Palace the primary residence of the Bourbons of Naples for more than a hundred years, first as Kings of Naples and Sicily (1734-1816) and later as Kings of the two Sicilies (1816-1861). It was also the residence for Joseph Bonaparte and Joachim Murat during French rule (1806-1815), during which extensive redecorations were carried out.\nThe Naples Palace is absolutely beautiful, the architecture and the art are amazing. I did all of it and it was totally worth it. The grandeur of the place, was unbelievable, the staircase alone was fantastic. I totally recommend coming in the morning and beating some of the crowds and also so you can take your time and spend as much time as you want without be worried about the Palace closing. I did an audio guide and personally, I recommend that because I was able to go at my own pace. The history of the palace is so impressive. Wouldn't hesitate to recommend. Thumbs up!!! 👍👍👍",

You learn a lot about the history of the Castel which you would definitely miss when you just walk through by yourself. You can see with the tour the prison as well so it's very interesting. The view from up there is also amazing. But if you don't want to get the tour the 6€ just for the entrance are not worth it. If you want to go there go at the early morning. I went like 10/11 am and there was no queue. When I went outside of the tour (which is an hour) there was a big queue just for the entrance.",

Ms Eliana explained to us about other animals and the zoo keepers were very patient to allow us to have a zoo experience with the capybaras and the giraffes. It was a really unforgettable experience. All the staff at the zoo take very good care of all the animals and one can see the care and dedication they have for them. The zoo is also peaceful and clean.

This was my first time seeing it up close-likely because my previous visits were quite short and mostly focused on nearby areas.\nI arrived around 7 PM, by which time the place was already closed, so I didn't get the chance to go inside. Still, even from the outside, it was an impressive sight. The building is massive and centrally located, making it hard to miss if you're exploring Naples. What really caught my attention were the numerous statues adorning the front of the structure. They reflect the deep historical and cultural richness of this region of Italy.\nNext time I'm in Naples, I'll make sure to visit earlier in the day so I can explore the interior as well. It's clearly a landmark worth experiencing fully.",

Built to honor Saint Francis of Paola and to thank God that Napoleon eventually packed up and left. A majestic dome, a peaceful interior, some pigeons outside… and, unfortunately, a few cardboard homes and piles of trash that slightly ruin the divine impression. The church was built as a thank-you to God for freedom… but when a guy zooms past you at 150 km/h on an e-scooter, you realize Naples still has its own version of what “freedom” means. :)",

Should you rely on Maps knowing that most ratings were set by tourists? 🤔\nNot in Barcelona 🇪🇸, for sure. But in Napoli 🇮🇹, things seemed different as I could see lots of locals in the main touristy streets...\nSo we decided to follow Maps for our dinner that day and we reached a place with good ratings that was open according to Maps but that was... closed in real life. 😤\nPlan B then: Spaccanapoli, a couple of streets away.\nThe look of the place was kinda cold, not cozy at all.\nThe waitress was nice even though she recommended that we order the most expensive item on the menu, the fried seafood 🦐 platter, without telling us about the price upfront... 😒\nAnd the food was more than correct. Especially the seafood that was great. 👍\nMy son dared to order a pizza 🍕 with fries 🍟 on the top which, to me, sounds like a heresy (like pineapple 🍍 on a pizza 🍕) but isn't so strange, apparently, as he already had that on a previous trip to Italy 🇮🇹. 🤷\nWe paid €22 each, no dessert, no alcohol. It's kinda expensive for Italy 🇮🇹 but yeah, that was mainly due to the seafood platter...\n\nQuality & taste: 8/10\nQuantities: 10/10\nAtmosphere: 6/10\nOriginality: 7/10\nRatio price / quality: 8/10\nService: 6/10\nHow I felt afterwards: 7/10",

Its compact size makes it easy to navigate-you can get from one part of the airport to another quickly, and going through immigration is usually fast and smooth. While it doesn't have all the amenities you might find at a larger international airport, the essentials are covered. Signage is generally clear, and if you do need assistance, the staff are helpful and approachable. Overall, a convenient and pleasant airport experience.",

            "text": "I recently traveled through Naples Airport (Aeroporto di Napoli) in Italy, and overall, my experience was a bit mixed, leading me to rate it 3 stars. The airport had a nice, festive atmosphere, as it was beautifully decorated for the New Year, which was a pleasant touch and added a bit of holiday cheer to the travel experience.\n\nHowever, there were several aspects that detracted from the overall convenience. The wait times were quite long, particularly at security and check-in. The process felt inefficient, and it added unnecessary stress to the travel experience. It wasn't just the wait at check-in; there seemed to be delays in other parts of the airport as well, making the entire process feel sluggish.\n\nCustomer service was decent but nothing exceptional, landing at a 5/10. Staff members were polite, but I didn't feel they went out of their way to assist or provide clear information. I expected a bit more in terms of service, given that it's an international airport.\n\nOne of the more uncomfortable aspects was walking out to the plane in the rain. This was especially inconvenient as I had to stand outside in the weather, which is never ideal. Furthermore, the international flight area felt somewhat isolated from the rest of the airport, with limited access to bathrooms and dining options. This was a bit frustrating, as there were few amenities in that section, which made the wait feel even longer.\n\nWhile Naples Airport has its strengths, particularly with its festive decorations and good location, the long wait times, less-than-ideal customer service, and lack of amenities for international flights are significant downsides. I would recommend preparing for a less-than-smooth experience if you're passing through this airport.",
