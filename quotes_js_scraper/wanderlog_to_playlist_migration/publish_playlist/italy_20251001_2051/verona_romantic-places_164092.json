Still, the place itself is an incredible experience. Sitting on a stone bench that's 2,000 years old and imagining what it was like back then is truly special.\n\nThe day was hot, and there's naturally no shade in the outdoor areas of the Arena, so be prepared for high temperatures. Ticket prices are fairly high, especially considering there's not much to see beyond the Arena itself. It's best to buy tickets online-the line at the ticket office is long. We only realized this while waiting in line, but once we bought them online, we got in smoothly.\n\nSeeing an opera here is something you must do at least once in your life!",

This place was hands down the cafe highlight of my entire trip to Verona.\n\nThe coffee here is incredible - proper Italian espresso that actually tastes like coffee should. Their pastries are fresh, especially the cream and chocolate croissants which were perfect. You can tell everything is made with care.\n\nWhat really sets this place apart though is the authentic atmosphere. It has that genuine traditional Italian cafe charm - not touristy at all, just real old-school character that makes you want to sit there for hours. The aesthetic is exactly what you picture when you think classic Italian cafe.\n\nThe service was great - friendly staff who made the experience even better. And honestly, the prices blew me away. So reasonable for the quality you're getting. On average paying €6 for two coffees and two pastries.\n\nIf you're visiting Verona, seriously make time for this place. It's the kind of spot that makes a trip memorable. I ended up going back each day because it just felt so right.​​​",

It's the kind of vista that makes ya just wanna sit there with a cuppa and take it all in for ages. I even spotted this tiny little courtyard down below with what looked like a secret garden – proper charming! Definitely worth the trek up just for that panorama, even if your legs are burnin' a bit afterwards.\nThe menu's not massive, think more along the lines of toasties and maybe a pasta dish or two. I went for the simple and it did the job nicely. It's more about the chilled-out vibe and soaking in the scenery than having a fancy feed. The service was grand too, nothing overly fussy, just friendly folks handing your stuff over with a smile.",

            "text": "I recently visited Re Teodorico with my girlfriend to celebrate her birthday. We ordered two main dishes: The Pigeon and Rib braised in Valpolicella with puree. Unfortunately, our experience with the food was deeply disappointing. The Pigeon was already lukewarm when it arrived, and within just 2–3 minutes, it became completely cold - to the point where a visible white layer of fat had solidified on the meat. The second dish was no better - the rib was overcooked and dried out, lacking any tenderness or juiciness. I've attached photos to show exactly what we were served. To be fair, the staff was friendly and welcoming, and the view from the restaurant is truly beautiful. If you're looking for a spot with a scenic overlook, this place might be worth a visit - but I would not recommend it for the food. There are many other restaurants in the area with far better cuisine. Additionally, just across from the restaurant entrance there's a panoramic road with stunning views, perfect for photos and enjoying the moment - and it's free. In my opinion, Re Teodorico is overrated. The prices are far too high for the quality of the food we received. Had I known what to expect, I wouldn't have ordered these dishes even at half the price.",

The view from the terrace on the roof is beautiful and offers a unique look at the piazza.\n\nHighly recommend if you're exploring Verona and want a dose of art and elegance in a quieter setting.

Whilst we have seen the Bard's most famous play in Stratford, home of the RSC, there is something even more special when seeing it played live on the streets of Verona.\n\nThe cast of Teatro Nuovo Verona staged a wonderful interactive performance. Starting at the casa de Giulietta we followed the story through to the rooftops of Verona, the church of their fated marriage, the Piazza and Torre where tragedy struck and onto the backstage of the theatre itself for the haunting and forgone conclusion.\n\nRather than follow the entire story, this play focused on the key plot points and filled the time between with audience participation and tour. We all danced (barely), sung (badly) and cheered (deservedly), whilst a few select audience members played their hand at imaginary swordplay (particular kudos to the lady who's death scene had everyone in tears of laughter).\n\nFinally, the performers themselves... The two narrators were the driving force of the play, offering English and Italian dialogue seamlessly from one to the other. They helped guide and entertain us throughout, whilst occasionally joining in guest roles when needed. The Romeo and Giulietta we're captivating, humourous at the start and tragic at the end.\n\nHighly recommended and thank you to the cast and team at Teatro Nuovo for a magical evening!",

We tried the Amatriciana, the duck sauce (Anatra) and the pesto - each one delicious in its own way.\n\nThe bigoli itself is something special: thick, slightly crunchy in that satisfying, oily, rich kind of way that makes each bite a real pleasure. It holds up perfectly for eating on the go, easy to twirl with a fork and enjoy while driving. I only wish I had picked up one more! Highly recommended if you're in Verona, whether you're staying or hitting the road.",

This statue was erected in 1865 to commemorate the 600th anniversary of Dante's birth, and it was sculpted by Ugo Zannoni, a Veronese artist. It's made of white marble and shows Dante in a thoughtful pose, with a cloak and laurel wreath, just as you'd imagine the father of Italian literature.\n\nDante wasn't born in Verona - he was from Florence - but he lived in exile here for several years under the protection of the Scaliger family after being banished from his hometown. That's why this city honors him with such a proud monument. The location is also incredibly symbolic: surrounded by historic buildings, arches, and just a short walk from the Scaliger tombs. It creates this strong connection between art, history, and politics of medieval Italy.\n\nIf you're a literature lover or just appreciate cultural landmarks, this statue is a must-see. It's not just a tribute to a poet - it's a piece of Italian identity, standing right in the heart of Verona.",

Since there was no outdoor seating available, they graciously offered us a table inside until tables outside became available. Initially, they provided us with stools with a bar counter, which was convenient. However, when the outdoor tables opened, they offered to move us down to one of them, but we preferred the stools and bar counter.\n\nI ordered a Coca-Cola and a Moscow mule, both of which were delicious. While we waited, they brought out small sandwich bites and chips with peanuts. For dinner, we decided to split a margarita pizza, which was perfect for two people and incredibly delicious.\n\nThe bathroom is located outside the back door to the right.

We ordered the horsemeat and the pasta soup. Both were good. Service was pretty good as well, as we were done and out in about half an hour since we were on a time crunch.",

They have a good selection of wine as well as a fantastically priced house wine which was delicious. I was very grateful that it (red) was served cold.\n\nWe really enjoyed the three different cheeses aged at different periods., The contrast and tastes were delicious. In addition, we had the cold meats which complimented the cheese.\n\nI had the lasagne, which could have had a little bit more meat inside. The lasagne sheets were light and dedicate.\n\nWell priced, and a pleasant environment to spend an evening.",

So, here we go:\nThis is one of the most famous Piazzi in Verona. And maybe the most popular, because of the Arena di Verona which sits right here on this piazza.\n\nAll the main bus lines stop here, so it's easy to get here (and getting back home). Even though there are loads of tourists, it doesn't feel overcrowded, just because of the size. You even can rest your legs at the small park here, it's quite relaxing. There are countless restaurants with nice views....but all the same (and lame) tourist menus. Good for a drink, but for good food head somewhere else.\n\nFrom here you should walk along Via Giuseppe Mazzini, which is busy, but very charming and has some good shops.\n\nSo all in all a really nice Piazza, you'll get some nice pics here with the Arena in the back. And it's a good starting point for exploring Verona.",
