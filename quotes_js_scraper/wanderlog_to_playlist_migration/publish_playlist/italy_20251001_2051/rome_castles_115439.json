This mail my due to following:\n- castello: there is a nice show inside in a big hall but from the castello you don't see really anything\n- parking wasn't convenient specifically with two small kids as well more far away. The entrance to the castle is train station therefore go straight to the train station and park there ( straight at the entrance and you avoid 4 euro parking fee)\n- I understand it was  beautiful day on the weekend but just too many people, long queues for toilet, lunch areas etc .\n- lunch restaurant was only one cashier , waited just for lunch 20min. Prices are ok and big portions\n- very unhygienic toilets and specifically not enough. For washing the hands you had to search for the hand washing sink which was hidden behind the toilet . Lot of people therefore didn't wash their hands. Cleaning lady tried to do her best but cleaned just one side of the toilet areas. There was only one (maybe there was another one but couldn't find them) big toilet for small babies where you could change them. Make toilets more adequate for kids and bigger so parents have also space in there . Lot of parents let the kids then urinate below the trees\n- Batman: very poor and basically the show was to go to the place of Batman and to take pic with him. Expected a real show like for all the other stuff. Lot of parents were disappointed .\n- Audio problems - lots of shows had audio problems and you couldn't hear what they say…\n- very negative: lot of people work there but very unorganized . Means for each show you need to be quick there otherwise you risk that your kid doesn't get a place to watch. Kids should stay in front and parents in the back\n- overall there had been not enough seating areas and tables , was very difficult to find a place to rest a moment but even for lunch to eat…\n\nIn summary very messy and disorganized overall. I thought to give more points for the workers as they are friendly and tried to do the best but the person who organizes this place should go himself with kids in order to understand what is wrong there if he doesn't see it himself. Some shows are nice and some others are mainly poor due to the setup .\n\nHappy kids means happy parents.\n\nThe same is also for : happy parents means happy kids as they are relaxed, intend to stay more , spend more money , etc",
