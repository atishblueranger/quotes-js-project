We came at 4pm, paid 30 euros for an umbrella and chair - not even a lounger, were told that's extra. When I asked about being closer to the water (the beach was less than 10% occupied), I was told I could lay on the sand. I actually do love laying on the sand - much better option than being in a chair provided by Bagno Europa, but then why pay at all?!\n\nStayed for less than 2 hours, unfortunately the sea had many jellyfishes. We left and never came back - found another beach club with much friendlier people and better kids facilities and toys.",

It has cabins that you can buy for cheap, car park (albeit small), the beach is particular with that small Laguna looking part that feels almost like a swimming pool.
