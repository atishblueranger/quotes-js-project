It’s worth a stop but not essential in our view if your budget or time is tight (in fact, the significant price increase in the last few years to €9 means that you may only wish to visit if you have the Verona Card, in which case entry is free).",

Still, the place itself is an incredible experience. Sitting on a stone bench that's 2,000 years old and imagining what it was like back then is truly special.\n\nThe day was hot, and there's naturally no shade in the outdoor areas of the Arena, so be prepared for high temperatures. Ticket prices are fairly high, especially considering there's not much to see beyond the Arena itself. It's best to buy tickets online-the line at the ticket office is long. We only realized this while waiting in line, but once we bought them online, we got in smoothly.\n\nSeeing an opera here is something you must do at least once in your life!",

The interior is stunning, featuring red Verona marble columns, Gothic arches, and several chapels with Renaissance frescoes. One highlight is the Assumption of the Virgin by Titian, located in the Cartolari-Nichesola Chapel. The cathedral is part of a larger complex that includes the Baptistery of San Giovanni in Fonte and the Church of Sant'Elena, where you can see ancient mosaic floors.

The fabulously ornate gilded organ casing has hinged door panels that are painted with allegorical scenes on the inside face so that they can only be seen when open.\nThe cathedral walls have stunning frescoes with clever perspective to appear like marble panelling.
