It wasn't just a shopping arcade; it was a sacred space dressed as elegance.\n\nThere was history in the air not dusty, but alive. As if the walls had witnessed centuries of desire, beauty, longing, and grace. I didn't feel like a tourist. I felt like I had entered a story I somehow already knew.\n\nI stood beneath the glass ceiling, watching sunlight pour in like divine gold, and felt the same sense of reverence I'd feel in a cathedral. There was luxury, yes but also soul. A reminder that beauty, when done with intention, becomes timeless.\n\nGalleria Vittorio didn't ask me to buy anything. It asked me to remember who I am: a woman who belongs in places made of light, art, and legacy.",

The sheer scale and intricate detail of the Gothic architecture are absolutely breathtaking. I remember just standing in the piazza for a good long while, just taking it all in-the spires, the statues, every little carving. It was an awe-inspiring moment that made me feel so small and, at the same time, so empowered to be out there on my own.\n\nThe best part, without a doubt, was climbing to the rooftop terraces. The views are out of this world! You get to walk right among the spires and statues, with a 360-degree panorama of Milan. I went just as the sun was starting to set, and watching the city turn to gold from up there was something I'll never forget. It was the perfect ending to my first day of solo travel, a moment of pure freedom and beauty.\n\nEven the inside is stunning, with all the stained-glass windows and massive columns. But for me, it was that moment on the roof, surrounded by that incredible craftsmanship, that made it a truly unforgettable experience.",

The sheer scale of the cathedral, combined with the intricate Gothic architecture and countless statues and spires, is simply awe-inspiring. It's the kind of place that makes you stop in your tracks.\n\nInside, the atmosphere is just as powerful. The stained-glass windows are absolutely stunning, casting colorful light across the vast interior. The detail in every column, sculpture, and altar shows the centuries of craftsmanship and devotion that went into building this masterpiece. It's both peaceful and overwhelming at the same time.\n\nOne of the highlights for me was taking the stairs up to the rooftop. It's a bit of a climb, but totally worth it. Walking among the spires and seeing the city from above – with the Alps in the distance on a clear day – is an experience I won't forget.\n\nWhether you're religious or not, the Duomo is a place that speaks to you. It's more than just a tourist attraction – it's a symbol of Milan, history, and human creativity.\n\nDon't miss it if you're in the city. Truly unforgettable.",

One even has an agility course.\n\nThe views here are unreal-on one end you've got the towering Arco della Pace, and on the other, the stunning Castello Sforzesco. One of the hidden gems is the Mermaid Bridge-an old stone bridge with beautiful carvings of mermaids, built in the 1800s.\n\nThe park also has beautiful ponds and little streams, full of fish, ducks, and even turtles. It's amazing for birdwatching-tons of species, and if you look carefully, you might even spot the bright green parrots.\n\nThere's also a cool children's amusement park, basketball court, sports arena, outdoor workout stations, and tons of fountains in case you or your pup get thirsty. You'll almost always catch someone playing live music, which just adds to the magic of the park. And if you're into culture, the Triennale design museum and the Civic Aquarium are both right here too.\n\nIt truly has everything and should not be missed.",

It combines, in fact, the warmth of the trattorias of the past with the charm of the Parisian ateliers of the turn of the century among noir walls, original works of art and the many photos hanging on the walls.",

Pretty disgusting and very unexpected for the price of dish. Never coming back.\n\nCorrection 1.\nSquids do not have bone but have a hard shell inside of them, which function as bones in other groups of animals. It's a very thin and hard plate, keeps them in the shape, and protects them. So yes, squids have a body structure similar to bone. And it's one of the parts you have to take off when you clean squids for cooking.\n\nCorrection 2.\nI chewed on it (it was so disgusting), immediately spat it out, and notified one of the servers. They did not offer me anything but to re-make the dish. I had finished 1 of 2 Squids at the time and the sever came back with 1 SQUID. I WAS NOT OFFERED ANYTHING EXTRA.\n\nThis is just one bad review out of hundreds of good ones. I post all cons/pros in my reviews to give a head up of what can possibly happen at the place.

My friends and I arrived at the rooftop and were told to wait 10 minutes because they were still setting up. We were patient, but 10 minutes turned into nearly 40 without any updates or acknowledgment. For a venue that markets itself as high-end, this level of disorganization is unacceptable.\nHowever, what truly shocked me was the attitude of the receptionist, Sara. Hospitality is the foundation of any premium establishment, and the complete lack of professionalism I experienced was beyond unacceptable. I won't go into details, but I sincerely hope management is aware of how their employee is treating guests-because if this is the standard, it reflects very poorly on the people running this place.\nTo make matters worse, once inside, I started noticing things I normally wouldn't if the service had been good-cheap cutlery, damaged walls, worn-out furniture. For a place that positions itself as high-end, it certainly didn't feel that way.\nI don't usually leave reviews, but this experience was so disappointing that I felt obligated to say something. Hopefully, the right people see this and take the necessary action, because word gets around quickly in certain circles.",

It felt like the focus was more on the spectacle than the flavor. Still, I can see how it would be a fun spot for people who enjoy adventurous, Instagram-worthy drinks.\n\nWorth a visit if you're into mixology as entertainment, but not the place I'd go for a classic, great-tasting cocktail.",

Not only did the food tantalize my taste buds, but I also enjoyed speculating about how each dish was crafted. To create each form, the chef utilized diverse ingredients and colors. Overall, the incorporation of cheese added a rich and creamy flavor, while the textures alternated between firm and soft in each course. The noodle-based dish mimicked the chewiness of clams, and the broths were savory. Encasing mussels in a soft cheese and finishing with pepper foam made the dish enjoyable even for those unaccustomed to spicy food. Each dish's plating complemented the plate's design, and the dessert's presentation evoked excitement, much like opening a secret box. The final bread and ice cream were a fitting conclusion, particularly the exceptional ice cream. The staff were courteous and enthusiastic when explaining the appetizers. However, I questioned the professionalism when the first staff member placed the amuse-bouche, only for other staff to reposition it. Unlike other Michelin-starred restaurants, this establishment did not offer adjusted menus or portions for children, which was disappointing. The restaurant's interior exuded a modern, simple ambiance, and entering through the gate and passing a small garden felt like entering a home.",

Chef Antonio Guida and his team deliver a tasting menu nothing short of extraordinary. Each plate is as delicious to eat as it is beautiful to look at. It was seventeen courses, and we left full and happy but not overly stuffed. From pigeon to sea urchin to risotto to three courses of dessert featuring a special Easter bread, everything I ate was unique, delicious, and prepared in a creative way. Seta should be a destination for everyone. Chef Guida and his team have created a celebration of flavor and  hospitality that will leave a lasting impression with you.

I've been to 5 Michelin restaurants before this one, so I had a little experience before visiting.\n\nTo be honest there was not a single dish that left me dissatisfied. Actually I'm writing this review almost a year after going so I can't go into details about the dishes. However what I can tell you after 1 year, is that I haven't found another restaurant that impressed me this much, and I have two dishes from this restaurant stuck in my head.\n\nOne is the pasta con le vongole… Who knew you can elevate such a simple Italian dish to such heights.\n\nSecond was the body temperature raw deer. Said like this it doesn't sounds great, but the whole point of this dish was to awaken the primitive instinct by eating raw delicate meat at around 36 Celsius. If I remember correctly the dish only comes with a black edible  looking net on top. A dish that I forever think about.\n\nIncredible I can't wait to revisit!",

From the moment we walked in, we felt welcomed and knew we were in for a special evening.\n\nIt's honestly surprising that this gem isn't at the top of every list of restaurants in Milan. The attention to detail in every aspect made it a memorable experience. I'm so glad we chose El Porteño for our final dinner in Milan before heading to Florence-it was the perfect way to end our time in the city.\n\nHighly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a standout meal in Milan.

The waiter also had difficulty cutting it for us, but we still each tried a piece regardless, thinking it might be the Milanese interpretation of the dish. However, to our disappointment, the steak was actually way too overcooked, and was impossible to chew.\n\nWe asked the waitress who placed our order if we had correctly made a request for medium rare, and she confirmed it and also agreed that the steak was not of the doneness that we ordered. She took action swiftly and asked the chef to prepare a new dish for us.\n\nThe second time the ribeye roll was served, it was only cooked to rare but we didn't really mind it. However, this time the steak had even more tendons than the fillet, which made it super difficult to cut, let alone chew.\n\nThat being sad, the steak sashimi with foie gras was perfect, and we could taste the freshness of the beef, with the foie gras and dressing taking the dish to a whole different level.\n\nApparently, the chef needs to practice precision cooking, but his ability to season the ingredients should be commended.",

The morning was beautifully pleasant with the sun peeking through the ample greenery in the park. There are a lot of dog-owners around with their cute little pets playing around and adding to the vibe of the park. There are many areas with different viewpoints and features. My favourite feature is a spiral ascending walkway, at the top of which is a natural drinking water fountain and a glorious view out into City Life, a busy and posh district in northern Milan. There's a duck pond too with a large area for seating. Overall, this has been a place of comfort and happiness for me since arriving in the city. ❤️",

The so-called “seafood” udon was undercooked and had minimal, shriveled bits of seafood that I had to dig for - very misleading.\n\nPortions were small, and while the service was friendly, it was also quite slow.\n\nFor the price, the experience feels unjustified - the quality simply doesn't match the hype or the cost.

Despite being full, the noise level was acceptable and did not interfere with conversation.\n\nThe food was of good quality, and each dish was presented with care. The courses were well-balanced, and the flavors met expectations. However, the desserts were the least impressive part of the meal: they didn't capture the same attention to detail and perfection as the main dishes.\n\nThe service, though polite, could be improved. One aspect I found a bit off-putting was the insistence on trying to sell additional dishes and drinks, which somewhat detracted from the experience.\n\nAs for the price, it's on the medium-high side: our bill for an appetizer, a main course, and a dessert (without wine) was 70 euros per person, which I consider fair for the quality of the dishes, but not exactly cheap.",

The staff were kind and professional - how could the driver and the waiter time it so perfectly that we arrived at the end the moment we finished our coffee? Okay, this is not a super high end food experience but still very nice. Water and drinks were provided generously. My one suggestion is - please improve your online booking service. I worked VERY HARD to get a table for 2, for two weeks I kept checking and refreshing until your booking rules changed 3 days before departure and allowed smaller groups at tables of 4. As a result you departed with many empty tables and lost income. I am an airline revenue manager and can provide some ideas on how to improve your pricing and booking! But seriously - keep it up, we loved every minute.",

            "text": "It was a fantastic idea to dine on a tram that lets you see Milan, an old historic tram. The staff is kind and the journey lasts about two hours. The cost is 90 euros per person, which includes an appetizer, first course, main course, dessert, coffee, and a bottle of wine for two people.\n\nThe price is worth it for the idea and the charm of the experience, which is unique. The food was good but not exceptional. The white wine was warm and the pasta was overcooked, which was a shame. I would have preferred a typical Milanese menu and more professional service.\n\nThe process for rescheduling or canceling is very strict. However, it is worth trying this experience.\n\nGood idea to  book in advance.",
