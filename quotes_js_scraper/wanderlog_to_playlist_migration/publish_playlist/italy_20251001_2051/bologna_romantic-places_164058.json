It's the sixth-largest church in Europe, and standing beneath its soaring vaults, you feel every bit of that scale. What made our visit truly special was witnessing the sunbeam cross the enormous meridian line, a sundial built into the floor that still tracks solar noon with remarkable precision. It was a quiet moment, but deeply powerful; like watching time and faith align in a single ray of light.\n\nWhat many don't realize is that this basilica was originally intended to be even larger than St. Peter's in Rome, until the Vatican halted its expansion. That ambition still lingers in the unfinished façade and colossal proportions. Every chapel feels like its own world, and the blend of Gothic structure with Renaissance detail invites you to linger.\n\nSan Petronio isn't just a church; it's a testament to Bologna's boldness, intellect, and soul. If you're lucky enough to catch the sundial in action, it's a moment that stays with you.",

A bit ambitious, for sure, but this is a wonderful park with miles of cycle paths, walking paths, woods, large meadows for picnics, informal games, sunbathing... you get the picture. It has a bit of a bohemian feel to it: not unkempt, but just relaxed, natural and a without pretentiousness. It is the gateway to the walk to the Basilica of San Luca (you start at the church of San Martino), a walk of around 1,5 miles (2kms), about 400m of hill climb, so you need good shoes and about 45 mins. And it is also the gateway to mountain biking alongside the Reno River, and will take you all the way up the valley - fantastic biking. The first part of that track, by the way, is what is known as the “Cammino degli Dei”: the historic Roman trade route, which connects Bologna to Florence. Anyway, if you are staying in Bologna for a few weeks, this Park is a must.",

Having arrived for lunch we'd hat to first sit outside a bit but within 15 minutes we got a spot. The essence of slow food is being presented by the kitchen & the servers. A wine collection that has been closely prepared made it even better. An amazing atmosphere for a saterday lunch, sitting inbetween friends & families. You can feel the culture & love of food.",

Everyone was so lovely- But the tall gentleman who seemed to be a head waiter, was incredibly lovely and welcoming, we didn't have a booking for lunch but allowed us to wait for 20 minutes to find us a table, in that time we sat outside and enjoyed a lovely sparking wine that he recommended and a snack. When we got our table we sat down, waiters offered to take our coats and bags. We wanted everything from the menu, so enlisted our great waiter to recommend something for us- he did not disappoint! You MUST get the lardo to start. The pasta with artichoke and cured meat was probably the best plate of food I've ever eaten. The first day we had the poached pear - simple and divine. The second day we had the milk pudding - incredible and annoyed that I didn't pack some in my suitcase home. We both left here feeling like we were being hugged by our stomachs! We proceeded to book a table for lunch the next day.\nI've eaten at around 8/9 of the well known restaurants in Bologna - this was the top. I did also say to my partner that it may be my new favourite restaurant and that I may have cheated on him with my pasta. I will be back!!!! @michelin - Bib Gourmand at least?",

Since we saw only locals inside, we opted to go in and I'm so glad we did. We found out later that this is the second oldest Osteria in Italy!\n\nThe photos on the wall depict some of its amazing patrons who have been here in the past. We both got to try to very different types of amazing wine, local to the region. We decided to bring food with us from the Butcher just a few stalls down. And I'm so glad we did. The local meat and cheese paired well with the wine that we had, and offered a great respite from the afternoon heat.\n\nThere is a bathroom, you don't have to pay to use, if you are staying and enjoying a drink. There is plenty of seats and tables inside. And there are a few spots outside for smokers as well.\n\nThe two gentlemen behind the bar were more than accommodating, and offered us a great deal of options to choose from for our wine. I was deciding between two that was suggested, and I was able to get a sample of each to try. The gentleman made sure I finish my entire sample before he poured me a fresh glass, fuller than I anticipated.\n\nThe prices were more than fair and with this laid-back atmosphere, I felt I could stay there for hours, enjoying wine and a meal. This place is also good for groups, as they have a good amount of space to accommodate.\n\nYou don't have to dress up, or feel uncomfortable in wearing something more casual here. It's not a very fussy place, which is why I think it should be on everyone's list to visit. No reservations needed, you just walk in and find a spot.\n\nWhen my husband and I returned to Bologna, you can be sure I will be coming back!",

However, I do feel that the tour is rather expensive for what you get in terms of quantity. Do not skip breakfast as other reviews have suggested. We expected to have a coffee at the beginning of the tour. As nice as they were, the pasta sample dishes were very small and left us wanting more food. Ice cream at the end was delicious. Gabriele was very kind in providing us with further recommendations for our time in Bologna and elsewhere in Italy.",

Bologna is home to so many local delicacies, going on a food tour is easiest to taste your way through the city, make some friends, and get superb recommendations for the remainder of your time.\n\nGabriele (our guide) is a true foodie and you can feel his passion for Bologna as a city, and Italy in general through the way he speaks of their food culture. He presented us with a little treat before starting the food tour 😋 We were brought to a local pasta laboratory to observe fresh pasta being made right infront of us! There was also balsamic vinegar tasting (amazing) at a local wine cellar, a meats-and-cheese platter, a sumptuous lunch (2 types of fresh pasta with butter/sage, and a ragu sauce), wines, a superb gelato, and a surprise treat to end the tour. Overall a wonderful experience (even in the heat of Italian summer).",

Unfortunately, it turned out to be one of the most disappointing Michelin experiences we've ever had. While the dishes were beautifully presented, the flavor combinations were outright unsuccessful. The entire menu was marked by an overwhelming use of smoky elements, which dominated and became monotonous across almost every dish.\n\nOut of the seven courses, there was only one we actually finished. We left the rest uneaten, despite the small portions-not because we were full, but because the food simply wasn't enjoyable. The most memorable parts of the meal were the snacks served beforehand: a puffed chip and a lemon sorbet, which were well-balanced and tasty. But it says a lot when the snacks are the highlight of a Michelin menu.\n\nThe wine pairing was also disappointing. One of the \"wines\" turned out to be a beer, which-while creative in concept-was a complete misstep. The beer had an intense smell of cow urine (not just the barnyard notes one might encounter in some natural wines). The waiter laughed and acknowledged that the beer had a peculiar flavor, which seemed to be part of the intended experience or a gimmick. Unfortunately, this did nothing to improve the situation, and we were left with an unusually unpleasant taste experience without being offered an alternative.\n\nWe expected a world-class meal but left the restaurant feeling both disappointed and frustrated. If this is the standard they are presenting, it's hard to see how they can retain their Michelin star.",

When I got the car from the shop, after changing the tires, I had the unpleasant surprise to find the summer tires in the car, two of them (dirty) being placed directly in the trunk, without being wrapped  in a protective foil and making a mess around.\nThey told me they didn't have more room in the warehouse, even though I have had a reservation made one week prior, with the option of storing the summer tires…\nHowever, they choose to replace the tires without notifying me by phone before, that they no longer have room  the summer tires, thus not giving me the option to choose another workshop for the exchange, where I could have left the summer tires. As a result, I had to pay double and loose 3 hours to find a solution for taking the summer tires to a place for storage. I regret that I made this choice and I do not recommend this service to anyone.",

Something I never would have ordered would be “cheese ice cream” with additional fried bread puffs (servers recommendation) but I tell you what it was quite delicious. We opted for a glass of the house white, crisp and refreshing. Mains were the classic ragu and the crumbed veal. The pasta was delicate and the veal was so tender. Would recommend to a friend.",

The food was tasty - with the daily menu offering seasonal delights.\n\nThe ambience is lovely - it's not a place to go if you want a quite dinner as all diners sit in one large, stylishly finished room. Will definitely return",

Out of four different dishes that we ordered, we only enjoyed one.\n\nTo make matters worse, the soup that I ordered with clams was filled with sand, which really detracted from the dish. And to top it all off, the prices were quite high, making the whole experience feel like a waste of money.\n\nAfter having some of the best meals of our vacation in Tuscany, it was really disappointing to end things on such a sour note. Overall, I cannot recommend this restaurant based on my experience.",
