I could have stood there looking at it for hours. Photos don't do it justice. The level of work that Michelangelo put into it is just incredible.\n\nHeads up, get skip the line tickets on Get Your Guide or Viator. Even with a tour booked directly through the museum's website with a time slot, there was still a long line. And the line for people without tickets didn't move a bit the whole 30 minutes I stood there, that I gave up and went and booked a skip the line ticket because the line is directly in the sun and it was giving me and many others sun stroke. If you have skip the line tickets, you go right in, just a quick stop at the security scanner and you're inside. Totally worth it to avoid the long wait.\n\nThe museum itself is kinda small but,\nthe atmosphere really lets you appreciate the art. The gift shop is also nice and has a good selection of souvenirs. Definitely a must see in Florence",

I love Tuscany and the Renaissance, and being in the Uffizi Gallery and seeing the works of famous Renaissance artists was like a dream. I had to pinch myself every now and then to remind myself that I was awake and that I was really in the Uffizi Gallery. We were visiting in May, so it was crowded, but I didn't notice it at all, as I was excited and enchanted by the visit and the whole experience. Seeing Botticelli's Primavera and Birth of Venus and Raphael's Madonna of the Goldfinch were experiences in themselves. And when I saw Artemisia Gentileschi's Judith Beheading Holofernes was the icing on the cake. The works of some of my favorite artists in one place and seeing them live was a privilege and an experience that I will always remember. As there was a crowd, we did wait a bit to get in, mostly due to strict security, and it took us approx 15 to 20 min which is completly normal for the time of the month and the popularty of Uffizi. We did have Firenzecard so we only had to book an appoitment for Uffizi Gallery which we did 2 days before the visit so we did save some time. And we also took an appoitment in the morning hours which was a great decison as the crowd got bigger the longer the visit went. You will need several hours for the visit and to not hurry through the gallery, so my advice plan your time well. We took our time to enjoy our visit so were in Uffizi from 09:30 until 12:45. Anyone planning to stay in Tuscany and Florence for more then one or two days, I highly recommend to get the Firenzacard. Makes visits to palazzo, museums and galleries that much easier and pleasent.",

We had an ample amount of time upon reaching the top of the Dome to take whatever pictures and videos we wanted to and simply enjoy the view before heading back down. The tickets purchased are for specific timeslots and certain numbers of people are able to go up at a time so I would definitely suggest purchasing one online or in advance and not worry about the wait since people are only allowed in at their specific times.",

Part of the Cathedral complex, this 14th-century bell tower was begun by the renowned artist and architect Giotto di Bondone in 1334 and completed after his death.\nBe sure to book your tickets online in advance, as entrance is limited and demand is high, especially during peak season. Without a reservation, it's unlikely you'll get in.\nThe climb to the top involves more than 400 narrow steps-there's no elevator, and the staircase can feel quite tight, which may be challenging for some. But the reward at the top is simply stunning: a panoramic view over Florence that includes an unbeatable close-up of Brunelleschi's dome.\nAside from the view, the tower itself is a masterpiece of Gothic architecture. The intricate exterior features polychrome marble panels and detailed decorations that deserve close attention. A physically demanding visit, but without a doubt worth every step.",

It is one of several churches that claim to be the oldest in Florence, having been consecrated in 393 AD,[1] at which time it stood outside the city walls. For three hundred years it was the city's cathedral, before the official seat of the bishop was transferred to Santa Reparata.\n\nSan Lorenzo was the parish church of the Medici family. In 1419, Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici offered to finance a new church to replace an eleventh-century Romanesque rebuilding. Filippo Brunelleschi, the leading Renaissance architect of the first half of the fifteenth century, was commissioned to design it, but the building, with alterations, was not completed until after his death. The church is part of a larger monastic complex that contains other important architectural and artistic works: the Old Sacristy (Sagresta Vecchia) by Brunelleschi and having interior decoration and sculpture by Donatello; the Laurentian Library by Michelangelo; the Medici Chapels, two structures that include the New Sacristy (Sagrestia Nuova) based on Michelangelo's designs; and the larger Cappella dei Principi (\"Chapel of the Princes\") being a collaboration between the family and architects.",

One legend says that if you rub its snout, you will return to Florence, while another says to think of a wish, then put a coin in the statue’s mouth and if it falls directly between the grates, then you’ll get your wish come true. Since right behind the fountain there’s a market, I think the best frame is from the side as you comply with either legend (or both).",

Every space is filled with precious artworks, marble sculptures, and golden frames that catch the light in magical ways.\n\nThe gallery itself is a treasure trove of Italian masters – Raphael, Titian, Caravaggio – displayed in opulent halls that reflect the taste and power of the Medici and beyond.

Everything you can find here is within 10 minutes walking. There are several public restrooms and plenty of places you can take a pause on a bench. There is also a beautiful view over the Tuscan landscape (I forgot the name of the place where you have this view).\n\nSomething people should be aware of is that they are currently renovating certain parts of the garden. For this reason, certain parts are closed or might ruin the experience of a beautiful looking garden. The fountains were not working as well.\n\nAnother point that should be pointed out is that everyone (also the people who only visit the garden), will have to go to security (which means you also go through a metal detector).\n\nThe only drawback I found is that the employees working here are not that friendly. This is something that had been pointed out by other people as well, so I am not entirely surprised. The employees gave me the feeling that they did not enjoy working here.\n\nThe garden was worth seeing but I am not sure whether it is worth a repeat for in the future.",

You can buy drinks there (an Aperol Spritz in a plastic cup was €7) and bring them down to the park. They also sell water refills for €2, so bring your own bottle if you can.\n\nJust a heads-up: the park closes at 8 PM sharp, and they do lock the gates - we know a few people who got to learn this the hard way.",

Notably, it is the world's first elliptical arch bridge, composed of three shallow elliptical arches. Originally built as a wooden bridge in 1252, it was reconstructed in stone after a flood in 1333. After collapsing again in 1557, the current version was built between 1567 and 1571, commissioned by Cosimo I de' Medici and designed by Bartolomeo Ammannati. Destroyed in 1944 during World War II, the bridge was meticulously rebuilt in 1958 using the original materials and plans. At night, the softly lit arches reflected in the river create a picture-perfect, romantic scene.",

The room was stunning, beautifully decorated, and spacious – a truly comfortable place to stay. There's also an elevator, which is definitely a plus. Daniel, the manager, was incredibly kind and welcoming – the service was exceptional. Additionally, there's an option to go up to the rooftop, where you can enjoy a breathtaking view of the entire historic Florence – truly a magical experience. Highly recommended\"",

While the view from the community rooftop was beautiful and the location was perfect, other aspects of our stay fell short of expectations. The accommodations felt more like a VRBO or Airbnb rather than a hotel.\n\nThere was noticeable mold growth throughout the bathroom ceiling and shower, and only one set of towels was provided for our entire stay. The building did have a potent smell throughout it. The staff member who welcomed us was not very friendly, though the one we met upon departure was much more pleasant.\n\nAdditionally, the terrace access was shared with all other guests, making the extra cost for a “private” apartment view feel misleading. The photos and descriptions did not clearly convey this.\n\nOverall, we wouldn't recommend this apartment. It was not worth the extra expense.",

From what I understood, you rub a coin on the outside of its mouth, then let it slide down its tongue, aiming for it to land in the lines below. Just be careful-there are people around who try to steal the coins, so make sure yours goes all the way inside.\n\nAside from that, the area offers a wide variety of leather goods, including bags, belts, and wallets. Be sure to check that it's real leather to avoid getting scammed.\n\nLastly, I bought a bag from @famiglia Meucci, and they were amazing! They took the time to explain the entire process in detail. I'm leaving their Instagram here in case you want to check them out or get in touch.",
