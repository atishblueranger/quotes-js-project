Towering cliffs, sparkling turquoise waters, and picturesque villages make this destination something straight out of a dream.\n\nI highly recommend visiting by coach if possible. The roads are incredibly narrow, winding, and steep, and while experienced drivers might manage, it's not for the faint-hearted! If you do decide to drive, go for a small car-a big vehicle would be a real challenge on those roads.\n\nBeaches are beautiful but often require a walk down the cliffs, and some do charge for entry. It's worth it for the experience, though! The restaurants along the coast are wonderful-laid-back, welcoming, and happy to let you enjoy your meal without rushing you, which is refreshing in such a popular tourist spot.\n\nParking is expensive-around €10 per hour-so if you're driving, plan to make the most of your time there.\n\nHonestly, words don't do it justice-I'll let the pictures speak for themselves.

There are some negative reviews and limited information about this beach, which may deter some, but will try to clear up somethings. The beach is accessible by stairs or by boat from Amalfi. There are two businesses there that offer a restaurant/bar and beds/umbrellas. I Due Scugnizzi has pairs of beds ranging from approximately €30-60, and the staff were very friendly-we got along with them well best price for cleanest prettiest beach. Lido Degli Artisti has more expensive beds. They also have a ‘sit-down restaurant' section, but they require you to spend a minimum (more than the cost of a meal for two with drink for each). Overall, we had a great experience with the food and drinks at I Due Scugnizzi. On our last day, we got caught in a storm for an hour, and I Due Scugnizzi kindly invited the people at the free beach to take cover.",

The beach is pebbly, so I recommend bringing water shoes, but that only adds to its charm.\n\nI suggest arriving early in the morning to enjoy the quiet atmosphere and find a good spot.",

There are about 500 stairs to reach the beach, not as bad as it sounds:D but you can also take a boat there, but I don't know the prices as we braved the stairs:D.

We contacted the restaurant 48 hours before hosting a post-wedding event for 30 people in September 2024 and they jumped into action. (The location we originally booked never confirmed and we had to scramble!) You would never know they organized last minute. The short boat ride from the main dock in Amalfi was coordinated for us and easy. The staff were welcoming – including drinks as we got off the boats and snack baskets on the beach. After we swam and relaxed, the staff (with nonna!) prepared a delicious lunch with fresh ingredients including local specialities that included vegetables, fish, meat, pasta, dessert, and drinks. We returned to the beach after lunch and enjoyed the sun, water, and additional beverages before heading back to Amalfi. We highly recommend Restaurant Santa Croce!",

But it is not possible for him to pay 55 euros just to take a bath in the sea, which I think is absolutely humane regardless of the place he is, whether it is touristic or not is also a matter of humanity, and from the moment that as a business you put a  such a price, at least he offered something to the customer, they didn't even offer us a glass of water.  I don't know if there were other options on the matter, but as a tourist I don't know them unless someone tells me.  Also, I don't mind paying a bit more, but it has some hidden value and isn't just expensive because it is.  The nice thing is that both the customer and the business owner have a good time, in this case only the business owner's pocket has a good time.  Personally, I wouldn't go to the area again, it's worth it just to take your walk, take your photos, drink a coffee, but that's about it.  And if I can prevent someone from losing money for no reason, I just will.  My opinion of course and it's nothing personal, I'm just saying what I saw.",
