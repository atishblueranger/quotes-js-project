Staff was very helpful and polite, they guided me to the ticket center and showed me the route of visit. Palace looks absolutely stunning and when you look at all the decorations and the gigantism of the structure you can just imagine the power and wealth the royal family had back then. The object is easy to reach as it is located in the center of Torino and has good public transport connections around it. Very recommend this place, you can learn many interesting facts about the history of the palace and the royal family of Savoy.",

They do small guided tours and only allow 10 minutes per group. Unfortunately, for me, this is worth docking the star. I visited here SPECIFICALLY for the armory as I am a medieval collector. I don't mind that there is a small group guided tour, but it was so quick. My wife and I were taking pictures and only got about halfway through the room when the guide forced us out and they said we could not visit a second time :(\n\nThe palace itself is truly spectacular and the art is vast and beautiful. Definitely one of the best museums minus the armory issue.\n\nCLOSED WEDNESDAY so plan accordingly.",

I understand if museum office might be closed but not church itself. We went in 13:18 and we were told by staff member that it is already closed.. 12 mins before schedule.

First of all, their dishes were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Secondly, they offered comforting yet remarkable flavour combinations, my favourite was definitely the squid ink pasta. The tomato, the squid, and the bottarga melded together to create a perfect sauce that clings to the pasta, absolute perfection. They also served very good olive oil, be sure to enjoy it with their bread. Would love to pay another visit when the time comes, highly recommend!",

We still really enjoyed the visit and seeing this beautiful palace. It is massive with beautiful gardens. Across the street are the former stables and farm houses. It is just a massive structure. We enjoyed our visit. It is a bit outside of town. From the main train station you must take Bus 282 or taxi (a taxi cost about 25 euros). We took the bus to the palace and a taxi back into town.",

            "text": "A place for connoisseurs. It's a very sophisticated restaurant, built in a former warehouse, on the back of an unsuspecting condominium, but tastefully furnished and effectively transformed into a huge veranda overlooking a courtyard overflowing with plants, both decorative and aromatic. The latter are also used by the kitchen, which also overlooks the courtyard. The menu is simple, but well structured, with starters and appetizers (two distinct sections), first courses, second courses and desserts. In the menu, the dishes are mentioned in a succinct manner, but the waitress will explain them to you in great detail on their articulated and sometimes exotic composition. The wine list is endless, making it almost difficult to decide. Even about drinking, it's pleasant and certainly useful to have a chat and ask the highly trained waitress for a suggestion. The dishes are so composite and original that you will spend some time just having the dishes described and discussing them, almost always also learning about some original and unusual ingredient, on which you may ask any questions, be told and then comment with waitress and between diners. For example, talking about a particular aromatic herb we never heard of before, she went out for a moment in the courtyard to take a sprig, to show it to us, let us touch, smell, taste it and ultimately to allow us to really get to know it!  In short, it is certainly a very \"cultural\" place, which ranges between world ingredients and gastronomy, but always maintaining firm roots in the Italian and Piedmontese traditions. Never boring, always interesting, a lunch at La Limonaia is like a little journey.  Very friendly service, but also informal and relaxed. Not a cheap place.",

I got the 9-experiences with the 4-glasses pairing, and my companion had the 7-experiences with a single glass.  We both were thoroughly impressed with everything.  One of the two extras I got was a nod to molecular gastronomy, with some pods that I think were freeze-dried that you dip in different varieties of olive oil.  Think freeze-dried astronaut ice cream, but with flavors like zucchini, sweet potato, radish, and artichoke.  Interesting, but I'd not get the 9-experiences a second time just for that.  But the other \"extra\" that I got, and my friend did not, was some little stuffed pasta with this amazing vegetable jus that made me wonder at the chef's ability to get flavor like that out of vegetables. The risotto was perfect, without a drop of cream, the smoked asparagus soup was somehow impossibly just as good as the artichoke soup at a famous place we visited the prior week, and the dessert (main ingredients were strawberries and cucumber cream in a piped almond milk cream cup) and after-dinner drink similar to gin and tonic were sublime.\nMy dinner companion pointed out that the mung bean pasta at the start, as well as the bamboo dish, had strong Asian fusion influences.  The potato with spice powders and artichoke with mousse dishes were unlike anything I've ever had and seemed completely original.  The one topped with crisp zucchini flowers confused me for a second as it was coming toward the table, because the presentation resembled prawns.\nI've yet to find anything close to this at home.  It was a real treat.",
