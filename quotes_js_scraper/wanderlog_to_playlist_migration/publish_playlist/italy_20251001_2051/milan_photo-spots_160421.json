Whether you stop for a cappuccino, to shop, or even just pass through the  Galleria on your way to another district of Milan, it’s definitely worth stopping to take a photo or two (or maybe 100!).",

The high dome above, the mosaic beneath my feet everything shimmered with a quiet kind of grandeur. It wasn't just a shopping arcade; it was a sacred space dressed as elegance.\n\nThere was history in the air not dusty, but alive. As if the walls had witnessed centuries of desire, beauty, longing, and grace. I didn't feel like a tourist. I felt like I had entered a story I somehow already knew.\n\nI stood beneath the glass ceiling, watching sunlight pour in like divine gold, and felt the same sense of reverence I'd feel in a cathedral. There was luxury, yes but also soul. A reminder that beauty, when done with intention, becomes timeless.\n\nGalleria Vittorio didn't ask me to buy anything. It asked me to remember who I am: a woman who belongs in places made of light, art, and legacy.",

The sheer scale and intricate detail of the Gothic architecture are absolutely breathtaking. I remember just standing in the piazza for a good long while, just taking it all in-the spires, the statues, every little carving. It was an awe-inspiring moment that made me feel so small and, at the same time, so empowered to be out there on my own.\n\nThe best part, without a doubt, was climbing to the rooftop terraces. The views are out of this world! You get to walk right among the spires and statues, with a 360-degree panorama of Milan. I went just as the sun was starting to set, and watching the city turn to gold from up there was something I'll never forget. It was the perfect ending to my first day of solo travel, a moment of pure freedom and beauty.\n\nEven the inside is stunning, with all the stained-glass windows and massive columns. But for me, it was that moment on the roof, surrounded by that incredible craftsmanship, that made it a truly unforgettable experience.",

There are cafes and restaurants tucked inside, wide open lawns that are actually clean and perfect for picnics, and tons of dog parks. One even has an agility course.\n\nThe views here are unreal-on one end you've got the towering Arco della Pace, and on the other, the stunning Castello Sforzesco. One of the hidden gems is the Mermaid Bridge-an old stone bridge with beautiful carvings of mermaids, built in the 1800s.\n\nThe park also has beautiful ponds and little streams, full of fish, ducks, and even turtles. It's amazing for birdwatching-tons of species, and if you look carefully, you might even spot the bright green parrots.\n\nThere's also a cool children's amusement park, basketball court, sports arena, outdoor workout stations, and tons of fountains in case you or your pup get thirsty. You'll almost always catch someone playing live music, which just adds to the magic of the park. And if you're into culture, the Triennale design museum and the Civic Aquarium are both right here too.\n\nIt truly has everything and should not be missed.",

Once I walked inside though, I was struck by the sheer beauty of it. Everything in San Maurizio has colour, whether it's paintings, mosaics or gold glitters everywhere. Nothing is uncovered by some form of colour including the pillars, ceilings and walls. The church is nicknamed the ‘Sistine Chapel' of Milan.\nThe church is located at what used to be the most important convent for women in Milan. The construction of this church took about fifteen years and took place in the sixteenth century. The building was split into two parts – one for the nuns and one for the faithful – and it was not until the end of the eighteenth century that this strict barrier disappeared.\nThe church is not very big, but it's definitely worth visiting. There's no admission fee and the staff are friendly and welcoming. I am so glad I visited San Maurizio. Thumbs up!!! 👍👍👍",

            "text": "Bosco Verticale in Milan stands as a potent symbol of futuristic architecture, boldly charting a course for urban development that harmonizes the built environment with the vitality of nature. Its very conception, twin towers draped in a living skin of thousands of trees and plants, transcends conventional notions of residential buildings. This pioneering integration of raw, untamed nature directly onto a highly refined architectural structure is a hallmark of its forward-thinking design.\n\nThe project envisions a future where cities are not sterile concrete jungles but thriving ecosystems, enhancing biodiversity and mitigating the environmental impact of dense urban living. The sophisticated engineering required to sustain such a complex vertical forest – from irrigation and structural support to plant selection and maintenance – showcases an advanced approach to building design.\n\nFurthermore, Bosco Verticale anticipates a growing awareness of ecological responsibility in urban planning. It suggests a future where buildings actively contribute to air purification, carbon sequestration, and the creation of microclimates, moving beyond mere shelter to become active participants in the urban environment.\n\nThe aesthetic impact is also profoundly futuristic. The dynamic interplay of the stark architectural lines with the organic, ever-changing foliage creates a visually striking and constantly evolving facade. This blurs the traditional boundaries between the artificial and the natural, hinting at a future where technology and ecology are seamlessly interwoven.\n\nBeyond the immediate visual and environmental benefits, Bosco Verticale serves as a powerful prototype, inspiring architects and urban planners worldwide to reimagine the potential of vertical greening. It posits a future where such integrated natural-architectural solutions become commonplace, transforming our cities into more sustainable, resilient, and aesthetically rich living spaces. The innovative spirit and ecological foresight embodied by Bosco Verticale firmly position it as a cornerstone of future architectural thought and practice.",

Interesting and thought-proviking pieces were on display. The building itself is also awesome, the inner units are celeverly organised and the staff is prepared and kind. There is a really nice \"bistrot\" in the building, which is also worth a visit. If anybody has any connection to modern art, this place is a must-see.",

From the 13th century onward, the basilica became associated with the Dominican Order and underwent significant expansion. One of its most notable features is the Portinari Chapel, built between 1462 and 1468. In the 19th century, the church's façade was restored in a Neo-Romanesque style.",
