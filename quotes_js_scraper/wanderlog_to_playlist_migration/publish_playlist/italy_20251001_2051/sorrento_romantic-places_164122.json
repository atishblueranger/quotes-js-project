We originally booked another wine tasting experience in Vrasa, but they cancelled last minute which left us with a gap in our day! Thankfully they did, because we randomly found this amazing winery and Fabio hosted a last minute PRIVATE tour for us - absolutely saved our day!\nThe tour included 7 different wines with a pairing of a selection of different meats and cheese from the freshest butchery! Fabio was very enthusiastic and you could tell how passionate he was about wine! An absolute 5 star experience and I would give more stars if I could.\nThanks again Fabio for saving our day and making the experience very memorable!!",

We had a large group, including some small children, and the hosts/owner treated us just like family. It was such a lovely time exploring the beautiful grounds, vineyards and Roman cisterns from 100 AD. The picnic area for the tasting was absolutely lovely and fully shaded. The wines were fabulous!!! Everyone in our group bought multiple bottles. The food prepared for the pairings was also exquisite. This is a must do experience when in Sorrento!!! Thank you for such a memorable day!",

The variety of the fish was excellent, I counted at least 7 x types, including prawns, octopus and snapper. The portion almost beat me... you'll not leave the table hungry! The staff are friendly and helpful, even blagging me a 1€ ride back up the hill on the 3 x wheeled chug chug - it is steep and long. The bus ride from Sorrento to the beach costs 1.80€ and takes about 20 minutes. This is a FREE beach, whereas the 'platforms' closer to Sorrento can cost up to 50€ to use.",

We are so glad we had the day with Giuseppe! He is funny, knowledgeable, full of energy, and a fantastic guide to the area. I also greatly appreciated his flexibility with our schedule, allowing us to end the day with more than two hours spent in Positano (a reverse of the typical schedule). Grazie Millie to Giuseppe for the great day! Highly recommend him to anyone visiting the area!",
