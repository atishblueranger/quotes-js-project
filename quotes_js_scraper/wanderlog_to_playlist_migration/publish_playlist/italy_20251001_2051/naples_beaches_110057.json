You need a swim cap for the pool, which you can get from them for €2. The seaside is rocky but with ample space & different areas for swimming. The rocks are slippery & there's no sand - not idea for someone who doesn't know how to swim. They have food & drinks (both alcoholic & none) but overpriced. The food should only be viewed as a necessity to keep yourself full should you stay the day - otherwise bland & not up to expectations. They start ushering you out at 4:30PM, with complete closure at 5PM as the venue also doubles as an event space. It's a beautiful setting but if you know of something better/you're comfortable with... go there instead.",

We got there around 10 and it wasn't crowded, at 12 a lot more people were there but mainly just to sun bathe the water was never crowded. The staff was friendly. From the club house the coast is stone, but once your in the water there is a little sand bar you can swim too. We paid the fee and selected the sea rather than the pool, when we got to the sea area a staff dude grabbed us some cots and found a spot for us. Bathrooms, showers, changing rooms there. You need to bring a towel, rent one or air dry. We grabbed lunch up at the club house, spent 10 euros on a chicken sandwich with fries a water and a coke. Just decent pool food with decent prices. It's a long walk down, be prepared for a trek back up or hire a taxi. We're in decent shape and needed a couple breaks on our way up.",

While it may not be immediately accessible, the effort to reach it is well worth it.

The crystal-clear water allows for great visibility of fish, making it perfect for snorkeling.",
