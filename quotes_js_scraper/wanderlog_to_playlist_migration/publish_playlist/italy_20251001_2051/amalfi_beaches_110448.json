Towering cliffs, sparkling turquoise waters, and picturesque villages make this destination something straight out of a dream.\n\nI highly recommend visiting by coach if possible. The roads are incredibly narrow, winding, and steep, and while experienced drivers might manage, it's not for the faint-hearted! If you do decide to drive, go for a small car-a big vehicle would be a real challenge on those roads.\n\nBeaches are beautiful but often require a walk down the cliffs, and some do charge for entry. It's worth it for the experience, though! The restaurants along the coast are wonderful-laid-back, welcoming, and happy to let you enjoy your meal without rushing you, which is refreshing in such a popular tourist spot.\n\nParking is expensive-around €10 per hour-so if you're driving, plan to make the most of your time there.\n\nHonestly, words don't do it justice-I'll let the pictures speak for themselves. A place you'll never forget!",

If you expect for a guest to tip more, you just have to add it to the guest's notice in menu or somewhere.\nSince in Italy all tips are not expected and are optional. How I suppose to know how much I had to tip?\nIn the USA there is a certain percentage that a guest has to tip, because server's salary there is 2-2.50$/hour, so it's not like here and I'm sure not like at Michelin star restaurant pay.\nGood luck",

If it's the latter, do we automatically start with 3–4 out of 5 points, or, on the contrary, do we judge with extra attention to detail?\n\nLet's try to be rational, fair, and most importantly, sometimes rely on our own feelings.\n\nTo begin with-yes, I recommend this restaurant. There were three of us. Normally, you need a reservation here, but even though we didn't have one, and even though we arrived almost at closing time, they still kindly found us a table.\n\nEvery dish was delicious. Yes, yes, I know-a Michelin Guide restaurant that knows how to cook pasta. Shocking, right? You may ask-why come here? After all, you can get tasty pasta at a nearby place for two or even three times cheaper. So what's the difference? Here, every dish is a carefully designed creation. A painted composition. Every ingredient and spice complements the dish and creates a swirl of flavors, turning into something new. Something unique.\nFood: 5/5\n\nThe restaurant sits right by the sea, with fresh flowers on each table and a warm, subtle glow of light that allows the sunset to take center stage.\nAtmosphere: 5/5\n\nThe service was flawless-elegant table settings, prompt serving, genuinely attentive staff, and above all, a feeling of effortless comfort. They even let us carefully choose from all the teas available.\nOverall service: 5/5\n\nOf course, you can find elements of this elsewhere, but rarely brought to such perfection. If you still don't understand what a Michelin Guide restaurant really is-come here and see for yourself.\n\nP.S. We came straight after swimming at the beach, so I left the cushion on my seat wet. Sorry for not mentioning it at the time!",

There are some negative reviews and limited information about this beach, which may deter some, but will try to clear up somethings. The beach is accessible by stairs or by boat from Amalfi. There are two businesses there that offer a restaurant/bar and beds/umbrellas. I Due Scugnizzi has pairs of beds ranging from approximately €30-60, and the staff were very friendly-we got along with them well best price for cleanest prettiest beach. Lido Degli Artisti has more expensive beds. They also have a ‘sit-down restaurant' section, but they require you to spend a minimum (more than the cost of a meal for two with drink for each). Overall, we had a great experience with the food and drinks at I Due Scugnizzi. On our last day, we got caught in a storm for an hour, and I Due Scugnizzi kindly invited the people at the free beach to take cover.",

There are about 500 stairs to reach the beach, not as bad as it sounds:D but you can also take a boat there, but I don't know the prices as we braved the stairs:D.

The short boat ride from the main dock in Amalfi was coordinated for us and easy. The staff were welcoming – including drinks as we got off the boats and snack baskets on the beach. After we swam and relaxed, the staff (with nonna!) prepared a delicious lunch with fresh ingredients including local specialities that included vegetables, fish, meat, pasta, dessert, and drinks.
