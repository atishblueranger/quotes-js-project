Towering cliffs, sparkling turquoise waters, and picturesque villages make this destination something straight out of a dream.\n\nI highly recommend visiting by coach if possible. The roads are incredibly narrow, winding, and steep, and while experienced drivers might manage, it's not for the faint-hearted! If you do decide to drive, go for a small car-a big vehicle would be a real challenge on those roads.\n\nBeaches are beautiful but often require a walk down the cliffs, and some do charge for entry. It's worth it for the experience, though! The restaurants along the coast are wonderful-laid-back, welcoming, and happy to let you enjoy your meal without rushing you, which is refreshing in such a popular tourist spot.\n\nParking is expensive-around €10 per hour-so if you're driving, plan to make the most of your time there.\n\nHonestly, words don't do it justice-I'll let the pictures speak for themselves.

He came out directly to meet our boat, expertly guiding us into position with an impressive level of precision that you rarely find nowadays. The manoeuvre was flawless - like watching a seasoned maestro at work. He didn't just assist; he took control with calm, confident authority and made a potentially tricky mooring look effortless.\n\nThis kind of hands-on, on-the-water service is increasingly rare. Giulio's approach isn't just helpful - it's absolutely first-class. He clearly knows every current, wind shift and centimetre of that port like the back of his hand. It's no exaggeration to say this is someone who's spent a lifetime mastering the sea.\n\nBeyond his technical skill, Giulio is also courteous, responsive, and fully focused on making sure your experience in Amalfi begins with the kind of welcome you'd expect from a top-tier marina. It's the kind of service that makes a difference - especially when arriving in a tight, often busy port.\n\nTo sum it up:\n✅ Incredible docking precision\n✅ Hands-on assistance right from your arrival\n✅ True professionalism and local expertise\n✅ One of the best mooring experiences we've ever had\n\nHighly recommended for anyone arriving by sea in Amalfi. Thank you, Giulio – you set the standard.",

In the summer it's probably hard to get a spot here.\n\nThe hard parts of this route is the track from Amalfi to Pontone (1000 steps) and from Amalfi to the nature reserve (probably the nicer walk alongside the stream). We skipped those and went from Pontone straight to the nature reserve (45 minutes to the sign at the ruins, then 30 minutes to the reserve).\n\nUnfortunately the reserve was closed. Maybe it's only open at the weekend in the off-season. If you follow the stream to the fence you can see the small waterfall anyway.\n\nWe really enjoyed the tour.

The cathedral itself is jaw dropping inside. The rich history of the cathedral and its artefacts is regularly denoted by signs.\n\nThere are signs requesting that you dress moderately, don't use a flash camera and respect the sanctity of the cathedral. That being said, there were plenty of people taking pictures inside…. As with most of the Churches and Cathedrals we visited in Italy you can light a candle beside a voluntary donation box.\n\nI would not recommend trying to eat your lunch on the Cathedral steps as the Carabinieri will get out of their Alfa Romeo and shout at you. We saw this happen leaving the Cathedral and a second time having had our lunch up the street.\n\nBeautiful Cathedral in a stunning location - just don't try to eat on the Cathedral steps. Italian police don't like having to leave their Alfa.",

We particularly enjoyed the mosaics.\nI've dropped one star because I suspect that the English captions (translations from Italian) have been done by AI or a similar system - they're not at all readable. For example, one caption refers to \"vegetables\" around a figure on a plinth, when it intends to say \"vegetation\". We were also concerned about the lack of protection for most of the mosaics and sculptures. You'd like to think that people can be trusted not to touch artefacts, but as has been seen at sites like Pompeii, that's not always the case.",

Just off the main cathedral is the Cloister of Paradise, a quiet and beautiful courtyard surrounded by elegant columns and arches.\n\nThere's also a small museum on-site with religious artifacts, including a display case said to hold a thorn from the crown of Jesus during the crucifixion.

This location, with its rich history and breathtaking views, adds a touch of romance and grandeur to any celebration.\n\nIf you're planning your dream wedding in Ravello, this is a must-visit spot-and don't forget to have a photographer who can bring these moments to life. Highly recommend this iconic destination!",

However, the walls were mostly white with little artwork. There was also a museum with old empty sarcophaguses, church artifacts, and sculptures dating back to the 13th century. It was a good experience, but it didn't blow me away. If you're in the area, I would recommend going to the nearby Amalfi Cathedral instead. It's the same price (4 euros) and it blows this cathedral away in size and ornateness.",
