It has multiple playgrounds, a carousel, and a place to eat and drink next to the pond with plentiful fish and turtles that can be seen from the seats. Plenty of shade on the hot days. We spent several hours here with our toddler and enjoyed every minute of it!\nSpecial shout out to the person in charge of the carousel: his friendly demeanor and mannerisms got our son to absolutely love him! Handing him the ride tokens was one of the happiest moments of the day for our boy.",

It's the sixth-largest church in Europe, and standing beneath its soaring vaults, you feel every bit of that scale. What made our visit truly special was witnessing the sunbeam cross the enormous meridian line, a sundial built into the floor that still tracks solar noon with remarkable precision. It was a quiet moment, but deeply powerful; like watching time and faith align in a single ray of light.\n\nWhat many don't realize is that this basilica was originally intended to be even larger than St. Peter's in Rome, until the Vatican halted its expansion. That ambition still lingers in the unfinished façade and colossal proportions. Every chapel feels like its own world, and the blend of Gothic structure with Renaissance detail invites you to linger.\n\nSan Petronio isn't just a church; it's a testament to Bologna's boldness, intellect, and soul. If you're lucky enough to catch the sundial in action, it's a moment that stays with you.",

However, the chapel of St. Dominic is open, and that alone makes the visit worthwhile. Here you'll find the saint's sarcophagus and a beautifully decorated Baroque ensemble with painted ceilings and intricate wall details.\n\nIt's about a 10-15 minute walk from the city center, easy to reach and not crowded. I even met a local priest giving explanations in Italian to a small group: if you understand the language, that adds an authentic touch.\n\nThis place is best for those exploring Bologna's cultural and religious heritage. Believers will appreciate the spiritual significance, while art lovers will enjoy the artistry and Baroque decoration.\n\n⚠️ Practical note: no clear info on how long the restoration will last, so don't expect to see the basilica in its full scale at the moment.",

There's a wooden choir of Fra masterpiece of Renaissance inlay Damiano da Bergamo, defined by contemporaries as the eighth wonder of the world. which you need to walk through the museum to get too and is one of most beautiful wooden crafts I have seen.\nOutside in the square of San Domenico  is the column of the saint, and the square is paved in small pebbles like it was in the medieval times. Also on the far end of the square are two more tombs with one of the them from the 9th century. The bell tower is 53 metres high in 13th century Gothic style.

Unlike the city's more famous landmarks, this basilica offers a serene escape, its grandeur quietly revealed rather than overtly displayed. The most striking feature is the magnificent quadriportico, a rare four-sided arcade that creates a beautiful, sheltered space, inviting you to pause before even entering the church. Walking under its vaulted arches, you can't help but feel a sense of history, a quiet echo of the centuries that have passed.\nInside, the basilica is a testament to understated elegance. The three naves draw the eye towards the high, pointed vaults, creating a sense of immense space and verticality. The true treasures, however, are found in the side chapels. The highlight is undoubtedly Cimabue's Maestà, a deeply moving and historic work of art that demands contemplation. The basilica's atmosphere is one of profound peace, making it not just a site for artistic appreciation but also a place for quiet reflection. For those seeking a less-crowded, yet incredibly rewarding, cultural experience in Bologna, the Basilica of Santa Maria dei Servi is an absolute must-visit. Its blend of architectural beauty and artistic wealth makes it a hidden gem worthy of every traveler's attention.",

The raw emotion in the life-size figures grieving over Christ is unlike anything I've seen - dramatic, human, and deeply moving.\n\nBetween the church, the Oratory, and the small museum, you get a glimpse not only of breathtaking art but also of Bologna's social and spiritual history.

I guess it proves how great the acoustics of the rooms are.\nThe museum has many rare instruments and frescoes - one early Medieval in the crypt and many Baroque ones by the school of the Carracci. They were all right but not as good like those in the Museo di Palazzo Poggi.\nThe museum was pretty low on my priority list but if you understand music better than I do, then you will probably have a better visit.",

I am not so interested in the musical instruments, but they were so beautifully painted and so old.
