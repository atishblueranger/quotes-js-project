You learn a lot about the history of the Castel which you would definitely miss when you just walk through by yourself. You can see with the tour the prison as well so it's very interesting. The view from up there is also amazing. But if you don't want to get the tour the 6€ just for the entrance are not worth it. If you want to go there go at the early morning. I went like 10/11 am and there was no queue. When I went outside of the tour (which is an hour) there was a big queue just for the entrance.",
