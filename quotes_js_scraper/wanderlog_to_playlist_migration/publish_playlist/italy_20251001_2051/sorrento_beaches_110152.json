            "text": "We walked here in hope of a more historical experience. The view was pretty good but personally, I'm not too sure if it made up for the 45 minute walk from the Sorrento town centre as there were sections where pedestrians had to walk along the busy, narrow roads with no dedicated pedestrian footpath. There were a good number of people laying down for a tan at Capo Di Sorrento and I guess it was okay if that's what one wanted, or perhaps wanted a swim. Fishing was also something that some were visibly enjoying! Free entry, free swimming and free sunbathing!",

I messaged about a month in advance enquiring as to if the beach would be open and if they could cater to vegetarians, and I found the correspondence to be prompt and hospitable. Once we arrived we were met with the warm and gracious hospitality that southern Italy is so famous for. We had multiple people looking after us and making sure we were happy. We spent the entire day here and it is one of the happiest memories we made during our trip. Wonderful place, do yourself a favour and spend a day here!",

The scenery was beautiful and the location offered a bit of privacy as it was the last beach club on the strip. The only thing I wish is that they had played music or I had brought headphones.

The location is stunning - crystal-clear turquoise water right in front of ancient Roman ruins, which added so much charm and value to the day. Truly beautiful.\n\nWe made our reservation the night before by sending a message on Instagram, and they replied instantly. The only condition was to arrive before 11:00 am so the reservation would be honored. We got there right on time, around 10:55/11:00, and were given premium spots in a perfect location.\n\nThe water was calm and beautiful to swim in, and the sunbeds were very comfortable. We brought our own snacks and drinks, which was no problem at all, and we also ordered some drinks on site. The staff was very attentive and friendly throughout the day.\n\nThe entrance fee is €30 per person. I understand some people may find it expensive to pay for beach access, but in this area (Sorrento/Amalfi Coast), beaches are mostly private and man-made. Considering how expensive the region is in general, I think €30 is absolutely worth it. Coming from Berlin, where a nightclub entrance easily costs €20–30, paying the same for a full day under the sun in such a beautiful setting felt more than fair.\n\nWe stayed until around 6:30 pm, enjoyed the sun the whole day, and the place never felt overcrowded. Overall, money very well spent and an experience I 100% recommend.",

The variety of the fish was excellent, I counted at least 7 x types, including prawns, octopus and snapper. The portion almost beat me... you'll not leave the table hungry! The staff are friendly and helpful, even blagging me a 1€ ride back up the hill on the 3 x wheeled chug chug - it is steep and long. The bus ride from Sorrento to the beach costs 1.80€ and takes about 20 minutes. This is a FREE beach, whereas the 'platforms' closer to Sorrento can cost up to 50€ to use.",

They even have a page in the back of the menu that lists the top food allergens with pictures to make it easier to communicate across different languages!  The servers were so friendly and spent 10+ min helping us try to find a taxi when none were available.  It wasn't overly crowded so we were able to sit and enjoy the food and view on the water.  Would absolutely go back again!",

My guess is everything we ate was swimming in the sea earlier in the day.\n\nWe had fried calamari as an appetizer and it was perfectly cooked.  Served with fries, which was a bit odd, but no biggie.\n\nWe had cheese ravioli for Primi.  Again, perfectly cooked with a nice light tomato ragu.\n\nFor secondi we went with a special they offered us.  It was a whole sea bass with broccoli and small potatoes.  Light butter lemon dressing.  Perfectly cooked and served tableside by the waiter who plucked it clean onto our plates with the traditional for and spoon technique.\n\nComplementary Limoncello at the end of the meal.  Two rounds.\n\nService was impeccable.\n\nSo why not five stars?  It was the bill.  We were surprised by the price of the fish.  It doesn't matter what it was.  I would just ask the server if you are offered a special what is the cost.\n\nWe have had great meals in Sorrento for about 25% less.  This was not fine dining.\nWe were careless and got burned.\n\nNote: The map picture.  Red pin for restaurant and blue dot for our table.\n\nIt was still a wonderful night, and yes, we would absolutely go back.",

            "text": "I had the pleasure of dining at Ristorante Bagni Sant'Anna during a recent trip to Sorrento, and the experience was nothing short of magical.\n\nSet directly on the water's edge, the restaurant offers breathtaking views of the sea – and as the sun began to set, we found ourselves dining against the most spectacular golden backdrop. It was one of those moments where the setting alone already felt special.\n\nThe food was equally impressive. We began with a beautifully grilled fish – light, clean in flavour, and not in the least bit dry. The squid was another highlight: perfectly tender and full of smoky, chargrilled character. The seafood pasta was truly memorable, with wonderfully chewy noodles and a rich, savoury sauce that brought everything together.\n\nFor dessert, we enjoyed a selection of canelé, tiramisu, and lemon cake – all delicious in their own right and a perfect way to end the meal. Each sweet offered a different texture and flavour, yet all were executed with finesse.\n\nWhat truly made the evening unforgettable, however, was the arrival of an elderly gentleman with a guitar just as the sun touched the horizon. He began to play O Sole Mio and other classics, and suddenly the entire atmosphere shifted – as if we had been transported into a romantic film. It was spontaneous, heartfelt, and incredibly moving.\n\nThe only regret I have is not being able to leave a tip for the musician, as I didn't have any cash on me – something I truly felt sorry for.\n\nIn every way, this was a flawless dining experience – from the food to the view to the atmosphere. I wholeheartedly recommend Ristorante Bagni Sant'Anna to anyone visiting Sorrento. It's the kind of place that lingers in your memory long after the sun has set.",
