We got to the entrance 15 minutes before the museum opened and there was already a line. That being said, the museum is huge and early in the morning crowds weren't bad at all! We ran right upstairs to the Botticelli rooms, and got to have them all to ourselves. Absolutely amazing. Everything in this museum from the architecture to the artwork itself is beautiful.",

            "text": "Visiting the Uffizi Gallery was a dream come true. I love Tuscany and the Renaissance, and being in the Uffizi Gallery and seeing the works of famous Renaissance artists was like a dream. I had to pinch myself every now and then to remind myself that I was awake and that I was really in the Uffizi Gallery. We were visiting in May, so it was crowded, but I didn't notice it at all, as I was excited and enchanted by the visit and the whole experience. Seeing Botticelli's Primavera and Birth of Venus and Raphael's Madonna of the Goldfinch were experiences in themselves. And when I saw Artemisia Gentileschi's Judith Beheading Holofernes was the icing on the cake. The works of some of my favorite artists in one place and seeing them live was a privilege and an experience that I will always remember. As there was a crowd, we did wait a bit to get in, mostly due to strict security, and it took us approx 15 to 20 min which is completly normal for the time of the month and the popularty of Uffizi. We did have Firenzecard so we only had to book an appoitment for Uffizi Gallery which we did 2 days before the visit so we did save some time. And we also took an appoitment in the morning hours which was a great decison as the crowd got bigger the longer the visit went. You will need several hours for the visit and to not hurry through the gallery, so my advice plan your time well. We took our time to enjoy our visit so were in Uffizi from 09:30 until 12:45. Anyone planning to stay in Tuscany and Florence for more then one or two days, I highly recommend to get the Firenzacard. Makes visits to palazzo, museums and galleries that much easier and pleasent.",

Lavishly decorated rooms, dazzling chandeliers, and finely detailed ceilings create a royal atmosphere that leaves you speechless. Every space is filled with precious artworks, marble sculptures, and golden frames that catch the light in magical ways.\n\nThe gallery itself is a treasure trove of Italian masters – Raphael, Titian, Caravaggio – displayed in opulent halls that reflect the taste and power of the Medici and beyond. It's more than a museum. It's an experience of beauty, history, and magnificence woven together.\n\nTake your time, look up often – and let this place transport you.\n\nEnjoy your stay here and have a fantastic time! 👋",

It is one of several churches that claim to be the oldest in Florence, having been consecrated in 393 AD,[1] at which time it stood outside the city walls. For three hundred years it was the city's cathedral, before the official seat of the bishop was transferred to Santa Reparata.\n\nSan Lorenzo was the parish church of the Medici family. In 1419, Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici offered to finance a new church to replace an eleventh-century Romanesque rebuilding. Filippo Brunelleschi, the leading Renaissance architect of the first half of the fifteenth century, was commissioned to design it, but the building, with alterations, was not completed until after his death. The church is part of a larger monastic complex that contains other important architectural and artistic works: the Old Sacristy (Sagresta Vecchia) by Brunelleschi and having interior decoration and sculpture by Donatello; the Laurentian Library by Michelangelo; the Medici Chapels, two structures that include the New Sacristy (Sagrestia Nuova) based on Michelangelo's designs; and the larger Cappella dei Principi (\"Chapel of the Princes\") being a collaboration between the family and architects.",

Her instructions were easy to follow as she walked us through making 3 different types of pasta, tortellini, ravioli and a wider noodle similar to fettuccini. She stopped by every single persons station to help with any troubles and provided much needed encouragement to those of us on the struggle bus. There was unlimited wine available for the course and following our noodle making process she immediately demonstrated how to complete the meal letting us eat our creations for better or worse. If you have the time and find yourself in Florence, this is a must-do class, if you are lucky enough to have Victoria as your chef, even better!!",

He didn't just teach us recipes, he gave us tips and recommendations for places to eat and explore all across Italy.

Part of the Cathedral complex, this 14th-century bell tower was begun by the renowned artist and architect Giotto di Bondone in 1334 and completed after his death.\nBe sure to book your tickets online in advance, as entrance is limited and demand is high, especially during peak season. Without a reservation, it's unlikely you'll get in.\nThe climb to the top involves more than 400 narrow steps-there's no elevator, and the staircase can feel quite tight, which may be challenging for some. But the reward at the top is simply stunning: a panoramic view over Florence that includes an unbeatable close-up of Brunelleschi's dome.\nAside from the view, the tower itself is a masterpiece of Gothic architecture. The intricate exterior features polychrome marble panels and detailed decorations that deserve close attention. A physically demanding visit, but without a doubt worth every step.",

You need to buy a ticket/pass to access the tower. Better to buy online as the tickets are sold months ahead. Access to the Bell Tower is only possible during designated time slots, and entry must follow the scheduled timing- there is no independent access allowed. There is no elevator, and the climb involves 414 steps where 2 people in some parts can barely pass. It's not recommended for individuals with heart conditions, vertigo, or claustrophobia. But the view from the top of almost 85m high tower is rewarding and worth all the sweat from climbing the stairs. You have 45min to climb up -admire the view and descend. The guards will move everyone out in time to get back down.",

Michelangelo, when he was 17 years old, was allowed to make anatomical studies on the corpses coming from the convent's hospital; in exchange, he sculpted a wooden crucifix which reflected what he learned about anatomy.\nNeed to pay the entrance fee to see Michelangelo's Crucifix, because the sacristy it's in is also quite nice.",

There is an intertwined altar section/altar/mihrab inside. It is worth seeing just for that. It had a very different design. I was very impressed. The house was right in the center of the church. Moreover, it was free. There is also a statue of Jesus made by Michelangelo inside. This part is a separate place and you can enter here for 2€. I definitely recommend it. See it.\nAlso the backyard is a wonderful place. The lemon trees, lotus and fish were wonderful. We were literally the only ones in a place like Florence.

Everything you can find here is within 10 minutes walking. There are several public restrooms and plenty of places you can take a pause on a bench. There is also a beautiful view over the Tuscan landscape (I forgot the name of the place where you have this view).\n\nSomething people should be aware of is that they are currently renovating certain parts of the garden. For this reason, certain parts are closed or might ruin the experience of a beautiful looking garden. The fountains were not working as well.\n\nAnother point that should be pointed out is that everyone (also the people who only visit the garden), will have to go to security (which means you also go through a metal detector).\n\nThe only drawback I found is that the employees working here are not that friendly. This is something that had been pointed out by other people as well, so I am not entirely surprised. The employees gave me the feeling that they did not enjoy working here.\n\nThe garden was worth seeing but I am not sure whether it is worth a repeat for in the future.",

During my recent visit, I was completely enchanted by this magnificent estate that combines Italian garden design, breathtaking panoramic views, and tranquil ambiance away from the tourist crowds.\n\nThe gardens cascade down a hillside offering multiple levels of exploration. The wisteria-covered pergola walkway is absolutely magical - a tunnel of hanging purple blooms creating a scene straight from a fairytale. The well-maintained gravel paths wind through meticulously landscaped terraces featuring vibrant azaleas, classic Italian statuary, and elegant architectural elements.\n\nWhat truly sets Villa Bardini apart is its unrivaled vantage point overlooking Florence. The panoramic terrace provides a postcard-perfect view of the Duomo, Palazzo Vecchio, and the entire historic center, all framed by the rolling Tuscan hills in the background. This view alone is worth the visit, especially during golden hour when the city is bathed in warm light.\n\nThe on-site café offers a delightful place to relax with refreshments while soaking in the surroundings. I particularly appreciated how uncrowded it felt compared to other Florentine attractions, creating an authentic and peaceful atmosphere.\n\nFor anyone visiting Florence who wants to experience the perfect combination of natural beauty, artistic landscaping, and breathtaking views, Villa Bardini Gardens is an absolute must-visit destination. It's a place that captures the essence of Tuscany's romantic spirit and will remain etched in your memory long after your visit.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",

The gardens themselves are beautifully designed, with well-maintained pathways, lush greenery, and charming nooks to explore. It's a peaceful oasis away from the hustle and bustle of the city.\n\nThe history of the garden is fascinating too. It was originally part of the Bardini family's estate and later redesigned in the early 20th century. The blend of Renaissance and Baroque styles is evident throughout, making it a must-visit for anyone interested in Florence's rich heritage.\n\nThe garden is open daily from 10:00 AM to 7:00 PM, with the last entry at 6:30 PM. Entry costs €10 for adults, with discounted tickets available for students and residents. It's definitely worth the visit for both the beautiful gardens and the incredible views!",

I am sure that Boboli is as well kept, or even better.\nThe views of the city from the garden are alone worth the entrance ticket price, but the quiet walk through the garden is also as enjoyable.\nThe place can be crowded around some panoramic areas, but on the whole, it is usually a peaceful place for one to enjoy, away from the busy streets of Florence.",

It is self guided tour with foreign language guide using your phone or it is written on each room with a brief description in Italian and English.\n\nVilla La Petraia is one of the Medici villas in Castello, Florence, Tuscany, central Italy. It has a distinctive 19th-century belvedere on the upper east terrace on axis with the view of Florence.\n\nIn 1364, the \"palace\" of Petraia belonged to the Brunelleschi family until in 1422 Palla Strozzi bought it and expanded it by buying the surrounding land.\n\nIn the first half of the sixteenth century, the villa became the property of the Salutati, who then sold the villa to Cosimo I de' Medici in 1544, who gave it to his son, Cardinal Ferdinando in 1568. Then from 1588, there was a decade of extensive excavation works which transformed the \"stony\" nature of the place (hence the name in Petraia, that is full of stones) into dramatic sequence of terraces dominated by the massive main building. It is traditionally attributed to Bernardo Buontalenti, even though the only documented certainty is the presence on site of Raphael Pagni.\n\nThe Villa remained in the ownership of the Medici family until their extinction, when it passed to the Grand Dukes of Habsburg-Lorraine. Leopold II laid out the Romantic style garden park to the north, but otherwise few changes were made. From 1860 the estate came into the ownership of the House of Savoy, becoming one of Victor Emmanuel II's favourite residences. During this time the central courtyard was given a glass roof and an aviary was constructed.[1] The villa was transferred to the Italian state in 1919 and is now a museum.",

As we got seated for our table, you understand how popular, maybe touristy, this restaurant has become. We were presented with handheld complimentary bites for the table, common around here, which were also delicious. Through our dinner service, our favorite entrees included the Pear Ravioli and a Lemon Chicken dish. These were truly incredible. The owner came by to wish my mother Happy Birthday many times and even came to sing with dessert. Such a warm, welcoming restaurant with true Tuscan nature.",

Its a pretty elegant place, so I wouldn't recommend bringing kids unless they are very well behaved!  We sat outside and enjoyed a couple of sparkling wines they recommended, followed by a tasting of a Barolo and Brunello (to compare).  We loved most of everything we tried to be honest.  We then got some amazing and detailed information about where to go and what to taste later on in our trip into Chianti Classico.  By the end of the trip we were able to validate that the recommendations from Zeno were among the best we received on the whole trip!  We would return in a heart beat, such a great place. We also purchased several wines from them at the end of the night!",
