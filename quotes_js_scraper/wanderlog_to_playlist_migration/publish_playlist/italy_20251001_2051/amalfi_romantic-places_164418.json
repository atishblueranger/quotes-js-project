If you're visiting the Amalfi Coast, this is a must-see destination. However, keep in mind that driving there on your own can be challenging.

Towering cliffs, sparkling turquoise waters, and picturesque villages make this destination something straight out of a dream.\n\nI highly recommend visiting by coach if possible. The roads are incredibly narrow, winding, and steep, and while experienced drivers might manage, it's not for the faint-hearted! If you do decide to drive, go for a small car-a big vehicle would be a real challenge on those roads.\n\nBeaches are beautiful but often require a walk down the cliffs, and some do charge for entry. It's worth it for the experience, though! The restaurants along the coast are wonderful-laid-back, welcoming, and happy to let you enjoy your meal without rushing you, which is refreshing in such a popular tourist spot.\n\nParking is expensive-around €10 per hour-so if you're driving, plan to make the most of your time there.\n\nHonestly, words don't do it justice-I'll let the pictures speak for themselves.

The staff were exceptionally warm, welcoming, and professional, making the entire experience feel seamless and special. The hotel itself is a masterpiece-elegant, historic, and set within the breathtaking gardens of Ravello with sweeping views of the Amalfi Coast.\n\nOur room was beautifully designed, spotlessly clean, and incredibly comfortable. The breakfast was another standout-an impressive variety of high-quality options, beautifully presented, and served with care in the most stunning surroundings.\n\nVilla Cimbrone is not only a five-star hotel in every sense-it's also one of the most spectacular wedding venues we've ever experienced. The entire celebration was unforgettable, and Mark and Peter ensured everything was executed with such grace and professionalism.\n\nWhether you're traveling as a couple, with family, or looking for the perfect wedding location, Villa Cimbrone is truly exceptional and comes highly, highly recommended.",

Just be prepared for a short 10 minute hike with stairs to reach the hotel, since there are no direct roads accessible, but your luggage will be taken care of by the hotel porters. The walk to the hotel is a refreshing experience itself, giving you a taste of the Ravello mountain life!\n\nThe staff were all polite and professional, catering to our every need. We went for our wedding anniversary, and the staff accommodated us at every moment, even opening up their helipad for our pickup during departure.\n\nHighly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to enjoy a peaceful escape far away from noise and people!",

In the summer it's probably hard to get a spot here.\n\nThe hard parts of this route is the track from Amalfi to Pontone (1000 steps) and from Amalfi to the nature reserve (probably the nicer walk alongside the stream). We skipped those and went from Pontone straight to the nature reserve (45 minutes to the sign at the ruins, then 30 minutes to the reserve).\n\nUnfortunately the reserve was closed. Maybe it's only open at the weekend in the off-season. If you follow the stream to the fence you can see the small waterfall anyway.\n\nWe really enjoyed the tour.

If you expect for a guest to tip more, you just have to add it to the guest's notice in menu or somewhere.\nSince in Italy all tips are not expected and are optional. How I suppose to know how much I had to tip?\nIn the USA there is a certain percentage that a guest has to tip, because server's salary there is 2-2.50$/hour, so it's not like here and I'm sure not like at Michelin star restaurant pay.\nGood luck",

If it's the latter, do we automatically start with 3–4 out of 5 points, or, on the contrary, do we judge with extra attention to detail?\n\nLet's try to be rational, fair, and most importantly, sometimes rely on our own feelings.\n\nTo begin with-yes, I recommend this restaurant. There were three of us. Normally, you need a reservation here, but even though we didn't have one, and even though we arrived almost at closing time, they still kindly found us a table.\n\nEvery dish was delicious. Yes, yes, I know-a Michelin Guide restaurant that knows how to cook pasta. Shocking, right? You may ask-why come here? After all, you can get tasty pasta at a nearby place for two or even three times cheaper. So what's the difference? Here, every dish is a carefully designed creation. A painted composition. Every ingredient and spice complements the dish and creates a swirl of flavors, turning into something new. Something unique.\nFood: 5/5\n\nThe restaurant sits right by the sea, with fresh flowers on each table and a warm, subtle glow of light that allows the sunset to take center stage.\nAtmosphere: 5/5\n\nThe service was flawless-elegant table settings, prompt serving, genuinely attentive staff, and above all, a feeling of effortless comfort. They even let us carefully choose from all the teas available.\nOverall service: 5/5\n\nOf course, you can find elements of this elsewhere, but rarely brought to such perfection. If you still don't understand what a Michelin Guide restaurant really is-come here and see for yourself.\n\nP.S. We came straight after swimming at the beach, so I left the cushion on my seat wet. Sorry for not mentioning it at the time!",

I'm putting a screenshot of komoot, a hiking app, leading to a great view up there, from which you can follow the signs and get to Torre. Once you're out of the city and on the stairs - follow the white-red markings and the road. It's an easy hike, but tiresome for there are a LOT of stairs. Still need to be in a good condition. As for the torre itself, I can't recommend going up. I did, yes, but stepped very carefully. I don't think this door is supposed to be open. The place needs some tightening, it seems it will collapse any second. The views are great even without going up the tower. I also recommend Belvedere, the view is even better, as it's higher. Visited in March, very pleasant. Not sure if google will keep them chronological in order though, but I hope you'll get some idea. Happy exploring!",

Again the views are amazing, you can enter the Torre and go to the top where there is a small platform to view Amalfi in full glory.\nOn the way back, I descended via Atrani to add even more beauty to the walk.\nBe prepared to loads of steps, but well worth the awesome views.",

There are some negative reviews and limited information about this beach, which may deter some, but will try to clear up somethings. The beach is accessible by stairs or by boat from Amalfi. There are two businesses there that offer a restaurant/bar and beds/umbrellas. I Due Scugnizzi has pairs of beds ranging from approximately €30-60, and the staff were very friendly-we got along with them well best price for cleanest prettiest beach. Lido Degli Artisti has more expensive beds. They also have a ‘sit-down restaurant' section, but they require you to spend a minimum (more than the cost of a meal for two with drink for each). Overall, we had a great experience with the food and drinks at I Due Scugnizzi. On our last day, we got caught in a storm for an hour, and I Due Scugnizzi kindly invited the people at the free beach to take cover.",

The short boat ride from the main dock in Amalfi was coordinated for us and easy. The staff were welcoming – including drinks as we got off the boats and snack baskets on the beach. After we swam and relaxed, the staff (with nonna!) prepared a delicious lunch with fresh ingredients including local specialities that included vegetables, fish, meat, pasta, dessert, and drinks.

I had the privilege of capturing magical moments in front of its historic facade, surrounded by the charm and elegance of Ravello's timeless beauty. This location, with its rich history and breathtaking views, adds a touch of romance and grandeur to any celebration.\n\nIf you're planning your dream wedding in Ravello, this is a must-visit spot-and don't forget to have a photographer who can bring these moments to life. Highly recommend this iconic destination!",

            "text": "The Duomo of Saint Mary is a decent cathedral, but it definitely fell short of my expectations. The cathedral area was pretty large and had some unique character. However, the walls were mostly white with little artwork. There was also a museum with old empty sarcophaguses, church artifacts, and sculptures dating back to the 13th century. It was a good experience, but it didn't blow me away. If you're in the area, I would recommend going to the nearby Amalfi Cathedral instead. It's the same price (4 euros) and it blows this cathedral away in size and ornateness.",
