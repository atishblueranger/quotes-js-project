The idol of Lord Ganesha is unique and radiates peace.\n\nPerfect for early morning or evening visits. Also a great place to sit by the river or enjoy a peaceful moment of reflection.

The entire trail was surrounded by lush greenery and cool mist, making the uphill climb pleasant and scenic. The ancient Buddhist caves are well-preserved and offer a glimpse into rich historical art and architecture. Monsoon adds a magical charm to the place with clouds floating around and panoramic views of Nashik city from the top. The steps are well-maintained, but can get slippery-so wear good shoes. Perfect spot for a peaceful trek, history, and nature. Highly recommend visiting during the rainy season for the best experience.",
