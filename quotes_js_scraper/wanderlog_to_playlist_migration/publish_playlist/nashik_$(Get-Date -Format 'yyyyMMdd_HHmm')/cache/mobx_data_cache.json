The entire trail was surrounded by lush greenery and cool mist, making the uphill climb pleasant and scenic. The ancient Buddhist caves are well-preserved and offer a glimpse into rich historical art and architecture. Monsoon adds a magical charm to the place with clouds floating around and panoramic views of Nashik city from the top. The steps are well-maintained, but can get slippery—so wear good shoes. Perfect spot for a peaceful trek, history, and nature. Highly recommend visiting during the rainy season for the best experience."

These ancient Buddhist rock-cut caves date back more than 2,000 years and showcase beautiful carvings, inscriptions, and sculptures that reflect the rich cultural and spiritual heritage of Nashik.\nThe caves are located on a hill, and visitors need to climb a series of steps to reach them. The trek is moderately easy, and the climb offers a refreshing experience with panoramic views of Nashik city, especially during sunrise and sunset. The atmosphere is peaceful, making it a perfect blend of history, spirituality, and nature.\nInside the caves, the detailed stone carvings, prayer halls (chaityas), and monasteries (viharas) give a glimpse of Buddhist architecture and life from centuries ago. The site is well maintained, with basic facilities, signboards, and guides available for those interested in deeper historical insights.\nParking is available at the base, and small stalls serve refreshments. It’s advisable to wear comfortable shoes, carry water, and visit during morning or evening hours to avoid the midday heat.\nOverall, Pandav Leni is a must-visit in Nashik for history lovers, travelers, and anyone seeking a peaceful and enriching experience. It’s not just a tourist spot but a journey back into ancient India’s cultural past."

The idol of Lord Ganesha is unique and radiates peace.\n\nPerfect for early morning or evening visits. Also a great place to sit by the river or enjoy a peaceful moment of reflection. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Nashik or looking for a quiet spiritual retreat.\n\n🙏 Must-visit for Ganpati devotees and lovers of heritage places!"

However, I really appreciated the separate queues for men and women, which helped manage the flow and made the waiting process a bit more comfortable. The overall arrangements were well-planned — from crowd control to basic facilities — the temple authorities have done a good job handling such a large number of visitors.\n\nThat said, due to the heavy crowd, I couldn’t get a proper or extended darshan of Lord Shiva. It was more of a quick glimpse as we were gently moved along to accommodate the next batch of devotees. While the spiritual atmosphere was still very much alive, I did miss having a peaceful moment in front of the Shivling."

The entire trail was surrounded by lush greenery and cool mist, making the uphill climb pleasant and scenic. The ancient Buddhist caves are well-preserved and offer a glimpse into rich historical art and architecture. Monsoon adds a magical charm to the place with clouds floating around and panoramic views of Nashik city from the top. The steps are well-maintained, but can get slippery—so wear good shoes. Perfect spot for a peaceful trek, history, and nature. Highly recommend visiting during the rainy season for the best experience."

These ancient Buddhist rock-cut caves date back more than 2,000 years and showcase beautiful carvings, inscriptions, and sculptures that reflect the rich cultural and spiritual heritage of Nashik.\nThe caves are located on a hill, and visitors need to climb a series of steps to reach them. The trek is moderately easy, and the climb offers a refreshing experience with panoramic views of Nashik city, especially during sunrise and sunset. The atmosphere is peaceful, making it a perfect blend of history, spirituality, and nature.\nInside the caves, the detailed stone carvings, prayer halls (chaityas), and monasteries (viharas) give a glimpse of Buddhist architecture and life from centuries ago. The site is well maintained, with basic facilities, signboards, and guides available for those interested in deeper historical insights.\nParking is available at the base, and small stalls serve refreshments. It’s advisable to wear comfortable shoes, carry water, and visit during morning or evening hours to avoid the midday heat.\nOverall, Pandav Leni is a must-visit in Nashik for history lovers, travelers, and anyone seeking a peaceful and enriching experience. It’s not just a tourist spot but a journey back into ancient India’s cultural past."

Even though I don’t drink alcohol, I found the place surprisingly enjoyable and worth the experience. The lush greenery, expansive vineyard views, and the calm, open-air vibe gave it a serene, vacation-like feel. It’s the kind of place where time slows down just enough for you to soak in the moment.\n\nI spent most of my time strolling around the vineyard and clicking pictures—the landscape is picture-perfect, especially around sunset when the golden light hits the vines. The architecture of the property feels rustic yet classy, and there are enough cozy spots to sit and relax for hours. Their café and restaurant spaces have a relaxed charm, offering a variety of vegetarian options, though I wish there were more innovative dishes on the menu for non-drinkers like me. Still, the wood-fired pizza and cheese platter were surprisingly good.\n\nWhat I liked most was how the place isn’t just about wine—it’s about the experience. Even without a wine-tasting session, there was enough to explore and enjoy. The gift shop is great for souvenirs, and the staff were courteous and didn’t pressure us into taking any tours we weren’t interested in.\n\nOverall, Sula was more about the peaceful escape, the vibes, and the views than the wine itself for me. I’d recommend it to anyone looking for a scenic day trip or a calm weekend break—even if you’re not into wine, there’s still something beautiful to take away from the experience."

The grounds are well-maintained, and the overall atmosphere feels upscale and curated for a pleasant day out.\n\nThat said, it’s very expensive for what you get. Wine tastings, food, and even basic experiences are priced at a premium, and not always justified by the quality. It feels more commercial than authentic at times, catering heavily to tourists rather than wine enthusiasts.\n\nWorth a visit for the views and photos, but go in knowing it’s more about the setting than the wine itself."

Whether you’re with friends, family or just looking for a refreshing escape from the city, this place is so worth it. Just a few hours from Pune or Mumbai, it makes for a perfect weekend getaway.\n\nThe estate is absolutely picturesque, straight out of a Pinterest board. Sprawling greenery, aesthetic spots and those giant wine bottles in the fields are a photo op you just can’t miss!\n\nThe wine tasting session was one of the highlights — fun, informative and a great way to understand the craft behind every glass. The cover charge is ₹600 per person, which you can redeem for wine tasting, purchases at the gift shop or even buying a bottle of your favorite wine 🍾.\n\nThey also have an in-house restaurant, so you can sip, savor and soak in the vineyard vibes all in one place.\n\nInsider tip: The best time to visit is January to April. That’s when the vineyard is lush with grapes and you might even get to try grape stomping 🍇 (a total bucket list moment!)\n\nAll in all, this one’s a must-visit. We loved every bit of it and would definitely recommend planning your visit during the harvest season for the full experience."

You also get to taste six different wines, and the portions are generous.\nThere’s an in-house restaurant where you can enjoy some Italian cuisine along with your wine, and a small gift shop as well.\nAt the entrance, there's a ₹400 cover charge per person which gets adjusted if you sign up for the tour. It’s a great spot to explore if you're driving between Mysore and Bangalore.\nProbably not ideal for a full-day outing, but definitely worth a short detour for the experience and the beautiful photos."

The vineyard tour is well-structured and informative, covering every step — from the cultivation of grapes to the fermentation, bottling, and storage of wine. Even though I didn’t taste any wine (as I don’t drink), I could still appreciate the effort, passion, and precision that goes into the entire winemaking process.\n\nThe tour guides were friendly, professional, and explained everything in a simple, engaging manner. The infrastructure and cleanliness of the place is commendable. They maintain the estate with great care, offering a very photogenic and serene atmosphere. There are also souvenir and gift shops, and a peaceful outdoor area to relax.\n\nThe only reason I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because for non-wine drinkers like me, the tour could be a bit more engaging — maybe they can add something like grape juice tasting or more interactive experiences beyond just wine sampling.\n\nOverall, even without touching a drop of wine, I had a memorable, educational, and enjoyable experience at Sula. Highly recommended for tourists, photographers, and anyone curious about the art behind India’s leading wine brand."

However, the good part is that this amount can be used as cash/coupons inside, whether at the gift shop, restaurant, wine shop, or for the tour and wine tasting.\nThat said, the wine-making tour and tasting itself cost ₹700, which is quite expensive, leaving little balance from the entry fee for other expenses. The tour lasts about 20 minutes and ends with a tasting of six different wines.\nInside, the place is well-maintained, with many great spots for clicking pictures. The parking area is spacious and well-managed. However, the Indian cuisine at their restaurant was not up to the mark—perhaps Italian would be a better choice. Overall, it’s a nice experience, but they could reconsider their pricing."

There are other sections dedicated to legendary and iconic wars fought during the World War (where Indian military was involved), 1961 China War, 1965, 1971 and 1999 Pakistan Wars. Lots of detailed information displayed along with the Artillery.\nTimings are 10 am to 1.30 pm and 5 pm to 7.30 pm (Entry closed 1 hour prior to the end time).\nAmple parking available. Clean washrooms are available. Pretty moderate ticket rates.\nIf you have time being in and around Nashik, this place should be a must. You will definitely come out as an more enriched and proud Indian than while entering it. Please do visit !"

The moment I entered the temple premises, I felt a sense of peace and calm that’s hard to put into words. The temple is beautifully built from black stone — simple yet incredibly powerful in its presence. It’s not just a place of worship, but a space that holds centuries of history and emotion.\n\nWhat stood out most to me was how well-maintained the temple is, and how serene the environment felt even though it's located in a bustling part of the city. There’s a deep spiritual energy here, and taking a few quiet moments inside the sanctum really helped me reconnect with myself.\n\nI also found the historical significance of the temple very moving — especially its role in Dr. B.R. Ambedkar’s movement. It made me reflect on the layers of culture and social change that places like this carry silently through time.\n\nI took some photos around the temple — the stone carvings and temple facade are absolutely worth capturing. The best time to visit is early morning or around sunset when the light makes everything look even more beautiful.\n\nWhether you're visiting Nashik for religious reasons, sightseeing, or just exploring, I highly recommend spending some time at Kala Ram Temple. It’s not just a tourist spot — it’s a place that stays with you."

Situated right on the banks of the Godavari River, the temple has a calm and peaceful atmosphere. The stone carvings and sculptures on the walls are amazing and showcase the fine artistry of the 18th century.\n\nThe famous Naroshankar bell (Ghanta) here is a unique attraction with its own historic story connected to the Peshwa era. The riverside view makes the visit even more special, especially during early mornings and evenings.\n\nThe temple is usually not overly crowded, so you can spend time peacefully.

The entire structure is crafted from black basalt stone, with intricate carvings visible on every pillar, arch, and dome. Its towering spires, symmetrical design, and solid stone construction reflect the brilliance of Maratha-era temple craftsmanship. The spacious courtyard and calm atmosphere make it a serene spiritual destination.\n\nDevotees of Lord Ram, especially those following the Bhakti tradition, consider this temple sacred and soul-soothing.

The temple holds immense significance, both spiritually and historically, especially for devotees of Lord Rama.\n\nThe temple is dedicated to Lord Rama, and the name \"Kalaram\" comes from the black stone idol of Lord Rama enshrined here. The idols of Lord Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana are all carved from black stone, adding a majestic aura to the sanctum. The spiritual energy in the temple is palpable — you can instantly feel a sense of calm and devotion upon entering.\n\nArchitecture & Ambiance:\nBuilt in 1788 by Sardar Rangarao Odhekar, the temple is a marvelous example of 18th-century Maratha architecture. The black stone structure and the intricately carved pillars are awe-inspiring. The temple premises are well-maintained and spacious, with a peaceful environment ideal for meditation and prayer.\n\nReligious Significance:\nKalaram Mandir is believed to be the exact place where Lord Rama lived during his exile. Panchavati is full of mythological importance, and visiting Kalaram Temple completes the spiritual circuit of Nashik. There’s also the Sita Gufa nearby, which is another must-visit spot tied to the Ramayana.\n\nFestivals and Rituals:\nThe temple is especially vibrant during Ram Navami, when thousands of devotees visit for darshan. Regular aartis and bhajans are performed, creating a devotional atmosphere. Many devotees tie sacred threads near the temple premises, praying for wishes to come true.\n\nSurroundings:\nLocated on the banks of the Godavari River, the area around the temple is bustling yet spiritual. Vendors selling flowers, prasad, and religious items line the street. Don’t miss the nearby Kapaleshwar Mahadev and the ancient Godavari Ghats — all within walking distance.\n\nOverall, Kalaram Temple is not just a temple — it's an emotional, historical, and spiritual journey. A must-visit for anyone traveling to Nashik or tracing the footsteps of Lord Rama."

              "reviewText": "I recently visited Someshwar Waterfall, and it was truly a refreshing escape into nature. Tucked away in a scenic setting, this waterfall is a serene and beautiful spot, perfect for a day trip with family or friends. The sound of cascading water, surrounded by lush greenery and rocky terrain, creates a peaceful atmosphere that instantly relaxes you.\n\nThe waterfall isn’t too commercialized, which makes it feel more untouched and authentic. The natural pool at the base is clear and inviting, though safety is important if you plan to step into the water. I recommend visiting during or just after the monsoon season (July–September) when the falls are at their fullest and most dramatic.\n\nThere’s also a small temple nearby, adding a spiritual touch to the visit. The area is relatively clean, and locals are friendly and helpful. Just make sure to carry your own snacks and water, as amenities are minimal.\n\nIf you’re a nature lover or looking for a peaceful retreat away from city life, Someshwar Waterfall is definitely worth a visit!"

This is a view only kind of waterfall. You cannot go and plan in water because of the gallons of water flow during rainy season. Can spend 1-2 hours at this place. Can visit Balaji and Someshwar temple which is nearby this place."

              "reviewText": "The place is nice in terms of location and ambiance, but unfortunately, the overall experience was marred by the behavior of the parking staff — something I feel compelled to share as a genuine visitor.\n\nDuring my visit, I was asked to pay twice for the same car. When I explained that I had already paid and handed over the receipt earlier, I was bluntly told that without \"proof,\" I would have to pay again. There seemed to be no proper system or accountability, and instead of helping, the staff became defensive and unreasonably aggressive.\n\nParticularly disappointing was the behavior of a lady staff member at the parking booth — in my opinion, extremely rude, dismissive, and lacking even basic courtesy. As a tourist, I found the approach unwelcoming and unnecessarily hostile.\n\nTip for future visitors: Please always keep your parking receipt in hand until you leave the premises. If you lose it or if the person to whom you handed it earlier isn’t around, be prepared for unnecessary hassle or even double payment. At that point, arguing feels pointless — which I believe is what they take advantage of.\n\nThis review is based solely on my personal experience and is shared in good faith to inform others. I sincerely hope the management takes note and improves the way their team deals with visitors — because the current attitude, in my view, reflects very poorly on an otherwise decent place."

              "reviewText": "Naroshankar temple is situated in Panchavati area, on the banks of river Godavari. It is one of the most beautiful pieces of temple architecture of the 18th century. The main temple is on a platform.  More than the ones  inside of the temple, sculptures on the outer part are stunning. The four directions of the temple are adorned with statues of the saints in Padmasana and its four corners are decorated with umbrellas, commonly known as 'Meghadambari' or 'Barasati',  of which only three are existing, the other being washed away in Godavari floods. When level of water in Godavari river is increased, touching the Naro Shankar Ghanta,  it is assumed to very dangerous as it indicates over flooding of river water."

Located on the banks of the Godavari River, the temple offers stunning views and a calm, refreshing atmosphere that makes it a perfect place for both devotion and quiet reflection.\n\nThe architecture is absolutely mesmerizing—built in the 18th century in the traditional Maya style, the temple is adorned with intricate carvings and fine detailing that speak volumes about the craftsmanship of that era. The bell tower, gifted by the British, adds a unique historical touch and is a must-see feature.\n\nWhether you're a devotee, a history lover, or simply a traveler looking for a peaceful retreat, Naroshankar Temple is well worth a visit. The surrounding area is also lovely for a stroll, especially during early morning hours or at sunset.\n\nIt’s more than just a religious site—it’s a living piece of history and a beautiful example of the region’s rich culture."

The hall is spacious, well-maintained, and ideal for weddings, receptions, engagements, and other social or corporate gatherings.\n\nThe decor is elegant yet adaptable to different themes, and the lighting setup adds a warm and festive ambiance to the space. The air conditioning and cleanliness were up to the mark, ensuring comfort throughout the function.\n\nOne of the standout features is the excellent staff service. The management was courteous and cooperative, making sure everything ran smoothly. The catering services were also impressive – the food was delicious, hygienic, and served promptly.\n\nParking space is decent and convenient for medium to large gatherings, which is often a challenge in city-based venues.\n\nOverall, Samrudhi Banquet Hall is a great choice in Nashik for hosting memorable events with a balance of professionalism, aesthetics, and hospitality. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a reliable and quality event space in the city."

We and his team had great interaction where he even helped us decide on color tones for our wedding reception. What stood out the most was his candid photography it was spot on and beautifully captured our special moments. He’s creative, cooperative, and has a great understanding of color and lighting. Our wedding portraits turned out amazing, and I’m truly thankful for his keen eye and attention to detail. I would definitely recommend him as one of the best photographers in Nashik and you can leave the photography to him and you will truly be amazed by his work."

The station has four platforms, and all basic facilities like toilets, drinking water, sitting arrangements, and even automatic lifts for going up and down are available. Boards with platform numbers and train names are clearly displayed. On platform 1, there are separate sitting areas for AC and non-AC passengers, which I found very convenient.\n\nIt was my first time traveling from Mumbai to Nashik. On the way, just before reaching Igatpuri, I happened to look outside — and honestly, it was an amazing sight. The train route goes through mountains, and the view from above looking down is just beyond words. Because it was the rainy season, the greenery made it even more beautiful. The train passes through tunnels and between two hills — it was such a peaceful and thrilling experience at the same time.\n\nTruly, it was a great, great, great journey — one I’ll remember for a long time."

If you’re just here to chill, the food court has some nice options, though it’s not as big as the ones in larger malls.\n\nThe vibe? Clean, well-maintained, and usually not overly crowded, except on weekends. Parking is manageable, but it can get tricky during peak hours.\n\nOverall, Pinnacle Mall is a good hangout spot—nothing over-the-top, but a convenient place for shopping, grabbing a bite, or just spending some time."

The security guard doesn't have manners to talk with a students , women's & with patient relatives on the 1st floor in female general ward. Even they don't allow to meet the patient . Even when I said I would compalin about this to the hospital he dismiss the matter saying that he did not care. He was arrogant while talking with us. They don't even fear and have respect for their higher official's.\nI am sure that I am not the only one who has experienced this at this hospital."

Students only get access for around 30 minutes every day to the ground. That eliminates cricket, football, volleyball, and tennis for students. Badminton and TT are there but minimal equipment is provided for them.\nThe issue has been raised against this multiple times but is always ignored by the sports as well as administrative faculty.\n\nThe academics are good. The teaching staff is supportive and great at their respective subjects. If you are completely study-focused then only consider admission here. 🙂"

Good layout of the rooms and minimal wastage of space\n\nCons:\n1. Extremely non responsive post sales service. Messages are not replied for days together and when the replies do come they are incomplete.\n2. Nobody bothers to explain complete process including registration, possession and sales deed. This has been an extreme  convenience to me as an NRI. This leads to a lot of rework and un necessarily added extra trips.\n3. While the layout of the rooms is good, the workmanship of the flooring and the quality of flooring used is extremely bad - the floors are uneven and the gaps between tiles are much broader than expected.\n\nOverall,  the project is amazing, you just have to deal with the frustration of lack of information and tardiness in response."

              "reviewText": "Treeland by ABH group, may have started as a dream project for many. No doubt that it is surrounded by lush green trees and is bound by the river on one side, but what makes a housing society livable and lovable is decided by  the experience you go through while living in it. This society and its management definitely needs to focus on the quality of basic services  (plumbing, electrician, carpenter etc. ) they extend to the people who live there. The society, Plumber, electrician, Carpenter-are seldom /never available. The response by the office bearers who are supposed to look into these matters is very mundane and is laced with poor initiative. There is no information available the service log ( listing of complaints vs how much task the plumber, carpenter, cleaners carry out in a day and in which all flats,  If a service requirement is logged (when would that be completed -no date or time is ever shared)\nThe society has only two small lifts, which eventually would result into a long waiting time and serve as choke points once its towers which are currently under construction, are full of people ( Right now, the occupancy is 1/10) With even such low occupancy the response time to rectify the day-to-day problems is extremely slow.\nThe service providers who are sourced from outside for basic needs, such as plumbing, electrification work are made to wait outside the main gate, leave their vehicles outside and then walk all the way to the flat they are required to go in. This experience is bordering harassment.\nI had almost made up my mind to buy a flat here, but now I wouldn’t. Nor would I recommend anybody for the same until the services improve."

The team, including Dipika Madam and site engineer Shinde, are highly unprofessional and lack basic courtesy. They show interest only when you are buying a property, but once the deal is done, they completely disregard you. Their communication is terrible, and there is clear mismanagement in the way projects are handled. The commercial properties were a complete failure. Don’t be fooled by their ads – their service and quality are far from what they promise."
