At most of the installations and paintings the descriptions are both in English and in Braille. It's so heartening to see the thoughtfulness in even the layout as ramps help in the movements of wheel chair bound art connoisseurs\n\nThe charges are minimal and you can even ask for a guide. A few hours spent here is just like touching the tip of the iceberg. I guess many more trips to the various sections of the museum should be planned in order to know and appreciate our art, culture and heritage.\n\nIt was so nice to see a batch of young school children being taken around -- an early awareness will help them mould well.\nA word for the staff -- very polite and helpful. They are certainly an asset to the museum.\nLooking forward to many more trips of discovery to this wonderful place",

The college has an enrolment of 200 undergraduates.Chandigarh College of Architecture was established on 7 August 1961 in Chandigarh, India, and was set up to impart education in architecture. Le Corbusier, who developed Chandigarh's master plan in 1951, got CCA established as a part of the Chandigarh Experiment.The college offers a five-year program leading to the degree of Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch) for which it is affiliated to the Panjab University in the Faculty of Design and Fine Arts. A semester system has been in place since 1972. A two-tier scheme has been in effect from 1985. The 10 semester course is offered in two tiers: Stage One, from first to sixth semester or three years and Stage Two, from seventh to tenth semester or two years. Stage One consists of theoretical subjects, tutorials, workshop practice and studio work for a basic grounding in the knowledge about architecture and its tools and skills. Stage Two comprises a six-month practical training followed by a large number of elective courses and studies of urban design, professional practice, town-planning and a thesis. In 1998, the program was modified to introduce more interdisciplinary courses and upcoming themes like building automation and sustainable design.",

From start to finish, their team demonstrated an exceptional level of professionalism, creativity, and expertise.\n\nThe architects not only listened attentively to our vision but also brought fresh, innovative ideas to the table that elevated the project in ways we hadn't even considered. Their attention to detail and commitment to quality were evident throughout every stage. The designs were not only aesthetically stunning but also functional and well-suited to our needs.\n\nWhat really stood out was their communication and transparency. They kept us updated on progress, provided clear timelines, and were always available to answer questions or address concerns. Their experience was evident, and it truly made the process seamless.\n\nI highly recommend Umesh Ji's work to anyone looking for an architecture firm that combines creative vision with technical excellence. They went above and beyond, and we couldn't be happier with the final result!",

Practical - there were so many things which looked better but would have given problems in long run.. their practical approach towards solutions helped avoid those issues.. writing this review after living at the flat for 5 years and with great confidence, engaging with them again for a new assignment.\n\n3. Normally, I have seen with my friends, they end up extensively over their initially planned budget.. not exactly the case here... that too without compromising any quality or refusing some last minute requested changes..\n\n4. Good team and frequent governance even on outstation projects... kept my personal involvement to minimal - mostly on design approvals...\n\n5.
