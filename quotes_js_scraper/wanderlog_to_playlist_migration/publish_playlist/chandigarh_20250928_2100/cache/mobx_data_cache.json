It’s both peaceful and deeply insightful and a must-visit for anyone who lives in or visits Chandigarh. Highly recommended!"

Its stark design and strategic placement demonstrate Corbusier's innovative exploration of light and shadow. The play of sunlight creates ever-changing geometric patterns, offering a dynamic visual experience. The tower's simplicity is deceptive, concealing a thoughtful study of elemental forms and their impact on human perception. As an experimental space, it remains a testament to Corbusier's avant-garde approach, provoking contemplation on the intersection of architecture and the sensory experience. The Tower of Shadows stands as an enduring symbol of Chandigarh's architectural experimentation and modernist legacy."

It is situated at Sector 1 Chandigarh.\nBecause high court and vidhan sabha is there, security is very tight here. You have to show your ID card to the security personnel to viait this monument.\nThis monument has historic meaning and value.

From start to finish, their team demonstrated an exceptional level of professionalism, creativity, and expertise.\n\nThe architects not only listened attentively to our vision but also brought fresh, innovative ideas to the table that elevated the project in ways we hadn’t even considered. Their attention to detail and commitment to quality were evident throughout every stage. The designs were not only aesthetically stunning but also functional and well-suited to our needs.\n\nWhat really stood out was their communication and transparency. They kept us updated on progress, provided clear timelines, and were always available to answer questions or address concerns. Their experience was evident, and it truly made the process seamless.\n\nI highly recommend Umesh Ji's work to anyone looking for an architecture firm that combines creative vision with technical excellence. They went above and beyond, and we couldn’t be happier with the final result!"

At most of the installations and paintings the descriptions are both in English and in Braille. It's so heartening to see the thoughtfulness in even the layout as ramps help in the movements of wheel chair bound art connoisseurs\n\nThe charges are minimal and you can even ask for a guide. A few hours spent here is just like touching the tip of the iceberg. I guess many more trips to the various sections of the museum should be planned in order to know and appreciate our art, culture and heritage.\n\nIt was so nice to see a batch of young school children being taken around -- an early awareness will help them mould well.\nA word for the staff -- very polite and helpful. They are certainly an asset to the museum.\nLooking forward to many more trips of discovery to this wonderful place"

Its fossil collection, particularly from the Siwalik Hills, offers a glimpse into India’s prehistoric past. Children and students are especially fascinated by the fossilized remains of ancient elephants, hippopotamuses, and dinosaur-era displays. Together with the art galleries, this blend of cultural heritage and natural history makes the museum a truly holistic learning space."

The 10 semester course is offered in two tiers: Stage One, from first to sixth semester or three years and Stage Two, from seventh to tenth semester or two years. Stage One consists of theoretical subjects, tutorials, workshop practice and studio work for a basic grounding in the knowledge about architecture and its tools and skills. Stage Two comprises a six-month practical training followed by a large number of elective courses and studies of urban design, professional practice, town-planning and a thesis. In 1998, the program was modified to introduce more interdisciplinary courses and upcoming themes like building automation and sustainable design."

The city plan was conceived as post war 'Garden City' wherein vertical and high rise buildings were ruled out, keeping in view the socio economic-conditions and living habits of the people. All the main roads were straightened out, the dimensions and organization of the superblocks were reformatted, a complete hierarchy of circulation was established, the nomenclature was changed, and the Capital \"head\" was firmly located in place.",

The building's grandeur, defined by its monumental scale and innovative design, reflects Corbusier's modernist vision. The interplay of geometric forms and the careful modulation of light create a dynamic visual experience. The large front door exhibits Le Corbusier’s own artwork which adds a touch of playfulness to the large concrete structure. While we only got to spend a short time there to take photos of the exterior, it is delicately a must see. The pools of water in front of the building create artistic photos as well. Unfortunately, a design flaw prevented the intended stream of sunlight into the courtroom through the blocked-off roof. Consequently, artificial lighting had to substitute, therefore the desired atmospheric effect wasn’t achieved. The expressive use of materials, including exposed concrete, contributes to its timeless appeal.

              "reviewText": "After finishing my studio subject this semester and my predominant precedent being Unite D’habitation my interest in Corbusier increased. Visiting the Palace of Assembly was surreal, the complete brutalist structure with it’s form geometrically so distinct and different from so many angles and the effect of light reflecting so distinctly and shimmering off the pond felt all so gracious yet contextually suitable.\n\nMany brutalist structures feel quite out of place in their context, especially due to it’s materiality, however the concrete and the natural lighting go hand in hand to create a slightly yellowed tone that reflects the historical context of the sandstone previously used around India. The light bounces so effortlessly and sharply depending on the time of day and has been so meticulously measured and accounted for as seen predominately on the entrance facade.\n\nInternally, this lighting in the main chamber would normally diffuse off the white reflective material at the height of the assembly room throughout the space however was closed when we entered. Instead we could admire the use of the primary colours again in a Corbusier project on a grandeur scale."

The building has since been maintained and converted into a museum spanning 2 of 3 stories, with the third being used as accommodation.\n\nThere are strong passive elements in the design and choice of materials, prioritising airflow and harvesting natural light whist deterring direct sunlight. The masterful technicality is juxtaposed with playful, experimental forms and colour creating a tactile and visually interesting experience that I would highly recommend.\n\nThe content of the museum is unfortunately overshadowed by the beauty of the structure. Images and information were scattered throughout the first floor and easily overlooked as there wasn't much structure to the displays. There was an over lack of uniformity to the museum as it was initially unclear to us where the museum started and finished. When ascending to higher floors, we were abruptly stopped from entering the third floor due to it being used as accommodation, this information that would have been useful before entering."

And I hired Sarab Architects for my house planning after my very disappointing experience with another architect in Chandigarh.\n\nHaving said that, out of many, one of the best thing about Sarabji is her tremendous patience, persistence and vast variety of unique and unconventional creative options she presents infront of you.  She puts her heart, mind and soul to give you a house plan which not only resonates with your desires about your dream house, but goes a step further to give you better than what you may have initially thought of. She is extremely intelligent, creative, positive, knows and loves her work,  believes in properly understanding customer requirements and puts sincere and honest effort in delievering better than client's expectations. Not just obtaining a customer commerically but she focuses more on building very cordial relationships.\n\nOne thing that differs her from the crowd is that she sensitively understands what a house means and signifies for an indivisual. Realising that a house is mostly once in a lifetime aspiration/event for a person, she gets passionately engrossed in the house planning process just as if she is constructing her own house. And under her leadership, her team diligently works in perfect sync.\n\nI think it was my best decision to invest my faith in her for my house planning. If you are looking for really good and innovative architect/house planner in Chandigarh/tricity,  Sarab Architects  would be just the right choice anyday. Highly recommended !"

Fantastic work, they spent good time getting and understanding of our taste and then planned things accordingly.\n\n2. Practical - there were so many things which looked better but would have given problems in long run.. their practical approach towards solutions helped avoid those issues.. writing this review after living at the flat for 5 years and with great confidence, engaging with them again for a new assignment.\n\n3. Normally, I have seen with my friends, they end up extensively over their initially planned budget.. not exactly the case here... that too without compromising any quality or refusing some last minute requested changes..\n\n4. Good team and frequent governance even on outstation projects... kept my personal involvement to minimal - mostly on design approvals...\n\n5. Professionalism in overall approach... plans / designs for everything, approval by us, etc.. etc...\n\nOverall fantastic work..."

I was shifting to my new place of practice,so within one meeting itself ,we finilised the things.As per the agreement,Mr Bhandari was supposed to visit my Clinic 'N' number of times and by the end of project,Mr Bhandari visited my place almost twice and used to personally supervise things besides being so busy.His team is nearly Perfect,organised and really good to work with.\nOur clinic renovation was finished before the deadline...and I still remember Mr Bhandari spending nearly all day there before my inauguration .\nIt is one of the most aesthetically desighned clinic and I give all credid to my architect...and I allowed him to plan and execute things as he wanted.\nRecently I came to know that Mr Bhandari has renovated Sector 34 Gurudwara sahib...and everybody has a word of praise and I feel very proud of being associated with Mr Bhandari.God bless you sir."

Washrooms are also available inside the garden which are very well maintained. There are some small stalls outside the garden to have some snacks. There are two seperate gardens inside this place which are linked with a subway. Another part of this garden is based on Chinese dragon theme. People come here for picnic. A must visit place for morning or evening hangout. You may also bring badminton or soft ball for playing."

It seems like no one is taking care of the garden or the structures inside—it badly needs a revamp.\n\nWhat was once a beautifully designed space has now become underrated due to neglect. The greenery should be well-maintained, and the entire area needs proper upkeep to restore its charm. It’s sad to see such a place losing its appeal.\n\nI really didn’t enjoy my visit, to be honest. If the authorities focus on maintaining it, this garden could once again become a great spot to visit. But in its current state, it’s not worth it."

The nicely built pagoda is the main attraction of this park. It is a large area divided between two parts which is well utilized by the local people for morning and evening walks. This is a good place for the children to spend time and do running other casual free hand exercises. They have an astro park, model dragons and many other sculptures related to Japanese culture. One can take a full round of walk in an hour or so since it is quite large. There are also some stalls outside the park for quick refreshments. The park needs attention from the corporation for good and regular maintenance which I felt is little missing."

Though it's a small garden, it offers a refreshing environment, especially in the morning when children come to play and enjoy.\n\nThe variety of flowers in the garden adds to its beauty, making it a pleasant place to relax and unwind. However, I feel this space is not meant for cricket or any other sports. It should be restricted to walking, exploring, sitting, and simply soaking in the tranquil vibes. Ironically, despite its name, it’s not always silent, but it still provides a calm atmosphere to escape the city’s noise.\n\nA great place to visit if you're looking for some relaxation and peaceful surroundings!"

              "reviewText": "The Garden of Silence in Chandigarh is one of those rare places where the name truly reflects the experience. Tucked quietly near the edge of Sukhna Lake, this garden is not about flashy fountains, crowded picnic spots, or buzzing markets. Instead, it is a peaceful retreat designed to offer visitors a moment of calm in their busy lives. At the heart of the garden stands a majestic statue of Lord Buddha, radiating a sense of serenity. Sitting in front of it, surrounded by greenery and open skies, you can almost feel time slowing down.\n\nWhat makes this place special is its atmosphere. Unlike other popular attractions in Chandigarh, the Garden of Silence is rarely overcrowded, making it an ideal spot for meditation, yoga, or just quiet reflection. The walking paths are clean and well-maintained, and the gentle rustle of leaves combined with the cool breeze from the nearby lake creates a naturally soothing environment.\n\nI recommend visiting early in the morning or just before sunset, when the light is soft, and the surroundings feel even more magical. Whether you are a tourist exploring Chandigarh or a local resident looking for a break, this garden offers something very unique—a chance to simply sit, breathe, and reconnect with yourself. The Garden of Silence isn’t just a park; it’s a reminder of the peace we often forget to seek."

              "reviewText": "Terraced gardens are beautifully designed landscapes that utilize a series of leveled platforms or \"terraces,\" each separated by retaining walls, to manage hilly or sloped terrain. This design not only creates a visually stunning effect but also serves practical purposes, such as preventing soil erosion and managing water drainage. Each terrace can be cultivated with different plants, flowers, or even small trees, creating a layered effect that is both aesthetically pleasing and functional.In a terraced garden, the lower levels often feature ground-cover plants or flower beds, while the higher terraces might showcase shrubs, ornamental grasses, or even small waterfalls or fountains. This layering allows for a diverse range of plantings that can thrive in different conditions of sunlight and shade, depending on the orientation and height of each terrace. The pathways or steps connecting these levels can be made of stone, wood, or other materials, adding to the garden's charm and accessibility.The beauty of a terraced garden lies in its versatility and the opportunity it provides for creative landscaping. Whether it's a private residential garden or a larger public park, terraces can be designed to incorporate seating areas, viewing spots, or decorative elements like sculptures and pergolas. These gardens are often used to showcase a variety of plants and flowers, making them a popular choice for botanical displays or themed gardens."

For a mere ten rupees, one gains passage into a world where opulence and austerity meet in the unlikely yet mesmerizing arrangement of cacti. As if painted by the meticulous hands of a devoted artist, each mound and hill cradles its thorny charges, presenting an unbelievable variety of species, from the robust saguaros to the delicate barbed whiskers of the cholla.\n\nThe pathways, swept clean, guide wanderers safely through this spiny paradise, inviting them to marvel without worry. The service mirrors the garden's pristine condition; attendants greet with smiles, eager to assist or impart knowledge of their green wards. Above all, the gardeners' dedication to detail captivates; their craft not only sustains life but sculpts it, creating vistas that whisper tales of fairy tales woven into the fabric of the earth itself.\n\nIn this modest Eden, where each step unveils another chapter of natural allure, the fee feels less like a cost and more like an invitation to witness a rarefied spectacle. The National Cactus Garden is not just a place to visit, but a realm to be experienced, where the soul can wander and wonder in equal measure."

There are a few wild mulberry and mango trees scattered around, and I even spotted a lone pear tree. I went in spring, which seemed like the off-season — I believe it would look a lot better in winters when it's greener and more lively.\nThat said, if you're in the city looking for a peaceful spot to unwind, it’s not a bad choice. But if you're after a more vibrant experience, I'd still recommend heading to Sukhna Lake instead."

At most of the installations and paintings the descriptions are both in English and in Braille. It's so heartening to see the thoughtfulness in even the layout as ramps help in the movements of wheel chair bound art connoisseurs\n\nThe charges are minimal and you can even ask for a guide. A few hours spent here is just like touching the tip of the iceberg. I guess many more trips to the various sections of the museum should be planned in order to know and appreciate our art, culture and heritage.\n\nIt was so nice to see a batch of young school children being taken around -- an early awareness will help them mould well.\nA word for the staff -- very polite and helpful. They are certainly an asset to the museum.\nLooking forward to many more trips of discovery to this wonderful place"

After living in Chandigarh for over 30 years, I was surprised at how much I didn't know about the architectural vision and the incredible story behind the city’s creation until I explored this place.\n\nThe centre offers a quiet, thoughtfully curated look into Le Corbusier’s work, his connection with Chandigarh, and the planning that went into building the city. It’s both peaceful and deeply insightful and a must-visit for anyone who lives in or visits Chandigarh. Highly recommended!"

Other attractions like Japanese garden, sacred grove, and the fountain were defunct probably because of the rainy season. So not much to do other than walk around for approx 2 hrs. Plus you are not allowed to take photographs with a camera which is absurd and maked the trip for photography enthusiasts deeply dissatisfying."

It is not just a garden, but a living piece of art created with so much imagination and dedication. Nek Chand’s vision of turning waste and discarded items into sculptures and creative structures is simply mind-blowing. Walking through the garden feels like stepping into a magical world – every turn opens up to something new and unexpected. From human figures to animals, walls, waterfalls, and hidden passages, the entire place is full of creativity.\n\nThe garden is well-maintained, and the layout is designed in such a way that you can spend hours exploring without feeling bored. It is also a paradise for photographers – every corner offers a perfect backdrop for pictures. Families, kids, and even solo travelers will enjoy the peaceful yet exciting vibe of the garden. The second phase with beautiful waterfalls and amphitheater-style seating adds to the charm, making it an ideal spot to relax after walking around.\n\nWhat I loved most was how something as simple as broken tiles, bangles, and ceramic pieces has been transformed into timeless artwork. It sends out a strong message about recycling and sustainability, much before these concepts became popular.\n\nThe only thing to keep in mind is that the garden is quite big, so wear comfortable shoes and carry water. It can get crowded on weekends, so mornings are the best time to visit if you want a quieter experience.\n\nOverall, Rock Garden is a must-visit landmark in Chandigarh – a place that beautifully combines art, history, and creativity. It is not just a tourist attraction, but a cultural treasure of India. 🌿✨"

Its stark design and strategic placement demonstrate Corbusier's innovative exploration of light and shadow. The play of sunlight creates ever-changing geometric patterns, offering a dynamic visual experience. The tower's simplicity is deceptive, concealing a thoughtful study of elemental forms and their impact on human perception. As an experimental space, it remains a testament to Corbusier's avant-garde approach, provoking contemplation on the intersection of architecture and the sensory experience. The Tower of Shadows stands as an enduring symbol of Chandigarh's architectural experimentation and modernist legacy."

From the moment you walk in, you're welcomed by a unique industrial-chic décor, upbeat music, and a lively ambiance that sets the tone for a great time. Whether you're out for a casual meal, catching up with friends, or looking for a fun night out, Social delivers on all fronts.\n\nThe menu is extensive and creatively curated, offering a mix of Indian, Asian, Continental, and fusion dishes. The Butter Chicken Biryani, Chinese Bhel, and Social Mezze Platter are absolute must-tries!

The Bhelpuri had a nice flavor but unfortunately arrived a bit soggy, which took away from the crunch you’d expect. The lemonade was quite disappointing — I had to send it back, and even the replacement lacked freshness and balance. The Aloo Tikki burger was decent, but nothing extraordinary. Overall, a mixed experience — some hits and misses. Hoping for better consistency next time."

The same goes for the food, plenty of varieties available in vegetarian and non vegetarian.\n\n1) We ordered a Killa kulcha platter, which was delicious, a power play platter, which was ok, and a Pakora platter, which was good and aerated drinks with lime\n\n2) In the pakora platter, the round one, which i guess was egg plant pakoras, was not tasty , and sauces could be better. They should introduce more varieties of sauces.\n\n3) All other options are very delicious here . You can try Chinese platter,  momos , North Indian platter, and various types of drinks.\n\n4) There is plenty of space here for sitting. Which is created and crafted in a smart and innovative manner. The same goes for their utensils.\n\n5) This is always a go-to place for me whenever i can't find a restaurant with reasonable prices and a reasonable portion size of food."

It’s small yet spacious with seating options like tables, couches, bunk seatings, outdoor sofas, etc. they host live music every evening starting 7 pm. All the guests enjoy the music with rhymes and sing-along. Each seating space has a QR code to scan for menu and place order, the housekeeping staff brings your food with care and optimum temperature. Their cold coffees are quite good and must try. Guests can play games like cards, jenga, etc that the cafe provides along with some books to read. I saw students doing their assignments and some professionals working on their laptops while sitting in the cafe.

While they do offer coffee, the loud music makes it difficult to enjoy a quiet reading session, which was disappointing given the name.\n\nThe ambiance is nice for hanging out with friends, and I appreciated the selection of books on the shelves and games available for entertainment. However, the customer service was lacking; I was greeted with stares instead of a warm welcome, which set a negative tone for my visit.\n\nAs for the coffee, it was below average. I believe they could benefit from investing in better baristas or higher-quality coffee beans to elevate the experience.\n\nOn a positive note, the interior is quite appealing, filled with interesting artwork, and they have cozy nooks where you can relax. Overall, Brew and Books has potential, but improvements in service and coffee quality would make a significant difference"

The vibes here are absolutely amazing, whether you're catching up with friends, working on your laptop, or just enjoying a quiet moment with a book, the ambiance is perfect. The seating is super comfortable and thoughtfully arranged, making it easy to relax and unwind. The washroom was not clean though\n\nThe food is consistently good with a nice variety on the menu, and everything I've tried so far has been fresh and flavorful. On top of that, the staff is warm, attentive, and genuinely welcoming, which just adds to the overall experience.\n\nDefinitely one of my favorite cafes in Chandigarh. Highly recommend!"

But after the first lecture she told me that tutors are not properly explaining or clearing doubts and told her to memorize french words. Tutors are moving very fast to complete the lecture rather than patiently teaching the students. Alliance is not for beginners and they should mention this upfront. Alliance is more focused on making money. We asked for a discharge and fee refund. Alliance refused saying they do not have any refund policy. Alliance should consider refunding the fee or offering a trial class. At the end my sister did not pursue her french course from Alliance. We lost all our money to them and it is a huge amount. It is my hard earned money that Alliance did not care about. I can't disclose here but found a way better french language institute than Alliance."

The quality of the instruction is exceptional, with native speakers as teachers who not only provide deep language knowledge but also offer insights into French culture, which truly enriches the learning process. The wide range of activities they organize from cultural events to language immersion experiences creates a dynamic environment that goes beyond textbook learning. I found myself growing in both language proficiency and cultural understanding, and I highly recommend Alliance Française to anyone eager to learn French in an immersive and supportive setting!"

              "reviewText": "Patton Tank Monument, Chandigarh\n\nThe Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a culmination of skirmishes that took place between April 1965 and September 1965 between Pakistan and India. The conflict began following Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan.\n\nThe seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and also witnessed the largest tank battle since World War II. Hostilities between the two countries ended after a United Nations mandated ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration.\n\nThe 1965 war witnessed some of the largest tank battles since World War II. At the beginning of the war, the Pakistani Army had both a numerical advantage in tanks, as well as better equipment overall. Pakistani armor was largely American-made; it consisted mainly of Patton M-47 and M-48 tanks, but also included many M4 Sherman tanks, some M24 Chaffee light tanks and M36 Jackson tank destroyers, equipped with 90 mm guns.\n\nIndian Army destroyed as many as 300 Patton tanks. As per Indian Defense News, the Pakistanis would abandon a tank soon after it was hit, fearing that it would catch fire and they would be charred in flames—not the best way to die for a Muslim.\n\nThis M46 Patton Tank was captured during 1965 Indo Pak War in the battle of Asaluttar Punjab. It was restored and reinstalled during 50th Anniversary. Inaugurated by Shri Vijay Dev, IAS , Advisor to the Administrator, UT Chandigarh on 31st August 2015.\n\nIt is installed at the parking lot opposite the Chandigarh Government Museum.\n\nPhotos by Viswas Menon\n© Viswas Menon\nWrite up compiled by Viswas Menon"

It is advisable to take a car only as there are chances of spotting leopard.\n\nBefore that you need to take a permit from Forest Department Sector 19. You need to fill a form, send it via email and within 1-2 days you can collect your permit from guard any time. I have shared format as well.\n\nAt end there is large park where you can sit and enjoy peaceful place. Park is maintained by Forest department and you can see spotted dears and Nilgai there.\n\nForest dept people have told that in winters leopards come to Nepli and in summers they go up to forests in Himachal."

Surprisingly, it wasn’t too crowded on a Sunday morning, which made the visit even better. The park features shaded picnic tables, a fantastic playground, and well-maintained bird enclosures. The Chandigarh Forest Department has done an incredible job creating this space right in the heart of the city (Near Sukhna Lake and governor house).\n\nKids were thrilled to experience birds up close, making it an unforgettable visit. Stepping into the large bird enclosures felt like a scene from Jurassic Park, with wooden bridges, waterfalls, and charming huts adding to the adventure. We purchased the Winged Wonder ticket for just ₹100, and it was absolutely worth it—highly recommend buying it at the entrance.\n\nWheelchair ♿-accessible limited street parking 🅿️ is available, but weekends can get crowded, so using public transport is a good idea. A must-visit spot for families, especially those with young kids! Sharing my pictures 🖼️"

It covers a large area and is divided into different sections (e.g., aquatic birds, aerial birds, etc.). The enclosures are clean, and the birds are properly fed and cared for. Visitors are strictly advised not to feed any of the creatures.\n\nYou can carry your camera to capture shots of the beautiful feathered residents. For those interested in botany, the park also features a plant section based on zodiac signs, with plants clearly labelled. The ideal time to visit is early morning or late afternoon. While inside, do practice basic civic sense and avoid causing any disturbance or chaos, especially in the enclosed areas."
