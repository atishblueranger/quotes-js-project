Many pavilions with picnic tables next to the beach.\nThere's also a functional toilet and outdoor shower for swimmers :) (though a bit rundown and unpleasant due to old age)\nTo our surprise, we also found the beach with thriving with lots of lives. At about 4pm, the tide is low enough and you can just walk in the lagoon. This is when we found a lot of hermit crabs, crabs, fish and even some corals :)))\nVery fun visit in short. I'll definitely return for another picnic or swimming",

From the first time I watched Mickey Mouse light up the screen to the heartwarming adventures of Moana and Elsa, Disney has always felt like a place where dreams come to life.\n\nSo imagine this: one day, right here in Singapore, Coney Island transforms into a haven of Disney magic. On one side of the country, we already have Universal Studios, filled with action-packed adventures and thrilling rides. But on the other side, Coney Island becomes a whole new world, where fairy tales come alive and nature meets imagination.\n\nIn this magical vision, you'd step into a park that blends Disney's beloved characters with the beauty of Coney Island's natural landscape. Imagine walking along a serene nature trail where Pocahontas and Meeko greet you, or crossing a wooden bridge that leads straight into Moana's tropical island paradise. The gentle sounds of waves crashing blend perfectly with the cheerful music of Disney's classic tunes.\n\nThe centerpiece of the park could be an eco-friendly castle maybe inspired by Elsa's ice palace but built with solar panels and surrounded by lush greenery. From there, each land would branch out like pages of a storybook. Picture an outdoor amphitheater where Simba and Rafiki teach lessons about the circle of life, or an enchanted forest where Tinker Bell's pixie dust sparkles at dusk.\n\nWhat makes this dream even more exciting is how perfectly it balances Singapore's love for modernity and nature. The park could have sustainable rides, quiet electric boats floating through magical lagoons, and even treehouse hotels inspired by Tarzan's jungle home. And when the sun sets, the night would come alive with dazzling fireworks, lighting up the skies over Coney Island and reflecting off the water.\n\nHaving Universal Studios on one side of Singapore and Disney magic on the other would make our little red dot the ultimate entertainment destination in Asia. Families could spend weekends going between thrilling Hollywood adventures and heartwarming Disney tales. Tourists from all over the world would flock to Singapore not just for the food and sights but to experience a perfect blend of action, nature, and magic.\n\nFor someone like me, who has always loved Disney, this would be a dream come true. A place where childhood memories meet the beauty of Singapore's landscapes, creating something uniquely magical. If one day this dream becomes reality, I'd be the first in line at the gates of Disney's Coney Island, ready to step into a world where imagination truly has no limits.",

I have not tried to get there by myself, but for sure I will figure out the way soon, still, many places I have not discovered yet.\n\nIt was such a great experience for me. We gathered at MSP at 7 am in the morning. The staff is extremely friendly and they even gave each of us a milo packet. After a short introduction and briefing, do's and don'ts, we headed to the boat. From MSP to the island, it will take roughly 1 hour, so for those who have seasick, please get yourself some pills. There is no restroom on the boat as well, so get yourself ready before leaving, or you have to wait until the end of the intertidal walk, before heading back to the mainland.\n\nWe got there at around 8-ish and started walking slowly through the camping area to the shore. There, you can find the local marine biodiversity during low tides. The staff will help you identify the creature and tell you some facts about it. We encountered sea stars, sea cucumber, some different types of crabs (the crab in my picture is the Hairy Crab or Teddy Crab), limpets, sea cockroaches, coral (anemone - house of Nemo is also there), seaweed, seagrass, etc. If you can spot some weird creature, just let the staff know, who knows, just like me, I suddenly spotted a Ribbon Worm, a little bit creepy but good to learn about it.\n\nFor those who don't want to get dirty or don't like those cleaning up activities, I would not recommend this tour since at the end of the intertidal walk, there will be a coastal clean-up activity. At around 10:30 am, our group started to pick up the trash and we successfully collected 5kg of trash, not much, but we are contributing something for the environment. The staff will also provide some statistics about trash that have been collecting for years. It could be a great data source for those students who are doing projects related to the environment. At 11 am we headed back to the mainland.\n\n(+) of the intertidal walk tour:\n- Marine life knowledge\n- Clear instruction before starting the tour (What to expect, what to bring and wear, what to do during the walk, etc.)\n- Friendly staff, willing to answer any questions of your\n- Punctuality\n- You can take plenty picturesque photos as well.\n- Good choice for kids who want to explore more about the biodiversity of the low tides.\n- Related information of the intertidal walk can be searched online easily\n\n(-) of the intertidal walk tour:\n- We purchased the ticket via Sistic - which is $107.00/ per pax. We understand the museum needs to use the money for many purposes (salary, boat tickets, operation cost, and so on) but we wish we could have a longer walk with more discoveries.\n- Quite sunny so be prepared to get tanned.\n\nP/S: I will definitely comeback here again to explore the other areas of the island.",

One of Singapore's oldest beach parks, it has a nostalgic charm and a laid-back atmosphere. The stretch toward Changi Village is especially serene and less crowded, even on weekends - great for sunrise views, beach walks, or simply enjoying the sea breeze and a quiet moment by the water.\n\nYou won't find the soft sands and clear waters of tropical resort beaches here - no one really swims - but it's a lovely place to soak in the sunset, watch planes from nearby Changi Airport, or picnic with family. Facilities like BBQ pits and fitness stations add convenience, and being close to Changi Village means you're just a short walk away from local eats like the famous nasi lemak.\n\nBeyond its natural beauty, Changi Beach also holds historical significance. During World War II, it was one of the sites of the Sook Ching massacre, where many Chinese civilians tragically lost their lives. A commemorative plaque near Camp Site 2 honors the victims and serves as a quiet, powerful reminder of the area's complex past. I'd rate it a solid 4 out of 5 - simple, meaningful, and a peaceful slice of Singapore.",

There is limited ferry services to check before book.\n\nThe island is very clean and atmosphere is very good. Far from the city life, far from noise and take a break here.\n\nTo see full island, take a bicycle on rent, which is little bit costly but without it, you can reach every corner of island.\n\nIf you want to swim at beach, take your cloths too.  Mane benches are there to swim.\n\nThe food court is also available but limited option. Also visit Lazarus island and Kukus island too.\n\nMust visit it.
