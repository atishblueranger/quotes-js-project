I often find myself drawn to this peaceful spot for a refreshing sea bath. What makes this place unique is the natural cliff that stretches across the sea, calming the waves and making the waters safe and gentle near the shore.\n\nThe water depth is generally around hip level, making it an ideal and secure spot for kids and adults alike to enjoy a relaxed swim. I personally love going early in the morning to witness the sunrise-it's a divine experience to watch the sun rise while being embraced by the gentle sea.\n\nA perfect place to rejuvenate your mind, body, and soul. I highly recommend this spot for solo retreats or family getaways-but kindly urge everyone to help keep this sanctuary clean and beautiful for all who come after.😇❤️🧬",
