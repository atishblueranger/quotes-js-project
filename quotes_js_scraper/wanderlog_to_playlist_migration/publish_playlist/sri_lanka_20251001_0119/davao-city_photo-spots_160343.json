There's also some interesting art and sculptures that give the park a unique personality.\n\nThat said, it could really benefit from better maintenance. Some areas feel a bit run down.

The first version of this cathedral was bombed and had a Neo-Gothic architecture. The church is very big with a unique architecture made from concrete. The interior is a big contrast from the outside with it being modern with a large and extremely beautiful altar. The mass I attended was good being presided by the auxillary Bishop of Davao. The San Pedro Cathedral was probably one of the biggest highlights for me visiting Davao. Note that there is pretty much no parking for the church.",

I know i expect too much but they were blocking the front door. I pushed the door myself to let ourselves in. When we finished eating we ordered dessert and we had to asked to clear our empty plates coz the waiter is about to serve it without clearing our table. Plus waiters are not acting very attentive to customers and they only had 3 tables to attend that time. I also expect them to act professional please! They gossip and joking around in front of us. Other than that, food was ok. This place is almost perfect! We say this things for them to improve their service.",

            "text": "A Memorable Visit to the Philippine Eagle Center, Davao\n\nOur family had a wonderful time exploring the Philippine Eagle Center in Davao. It was a unique and meaningful experience-especially for the kids, who were excited to see animals they'd only seen in books or on TV.\n\nThe highlight of our visit was seeing the Philippine Eagle up close-majestic, powerful, and truly one of a kind. The star of the center, Viggo, was a special moment for us. He's not only an ambassador for conservation but also featured on the front of our P1,000 bill, which made the encounter even more memorable for the kids.\n\nBeyond the eagles, there were plenty of other animals to see-monkeys, crocodiles, and several species of birds including owls and hawks. Each enclosure had informative signs that helped us learn about the animals and their conservation status. The center does a good job of keeping the place shaded and natural, so walking around was comfortable even during midday.\n\nThe kids especially enjoyed the lush, green surroundings and had fun spotting the animals inside their forest-like enclosures. One of our favorite photo spots was the little archway covered in vines and foliage-perfect for a family picture.\n\nWe left feeling more connected to Philippine wildlife and more appreciative of efforts to protect endangered species like our national bird. If you ever find yourself in Davao, this is a must-visit for families, nature lovers, and anyone wanting to teach kids about the importance of conservation.",

Because it has a lot of beautiful views with a lot of different kind of animal especially the philippine eagle. The place was clean and peaceful, which made the tour really nice. The tour guides knew a lot and helped us during the whole visit. The center was clean and well taken care of. You can tell they work hard to keep it nice. That why I had a great time walking around and looking at the animals.\n\nThis trip made me understand how important it is to protect animals that are in danger and how important it is to take care of our nature. I also liked the handmade souvenirs they were very pretty and creative. Overall, the Philippine Eagle Center was a great experience, hoping to visit this place again with my family.",

The animals looked healthy and well-cared for, and it was delightful to see the monkeys playfully reacting to our presence, showing just how lively and alert they are in their enclosures.\n\nThe tour was fairly quick, mainly because there were no scheduled animal exhibitions or guided tours during our weekday visit, which I understand may be part of their regular operating limitations. However, it would have been more engaging if the staff were more accommodating, especially in guiding guests on where to go or how to best navigate the area. Having a tour guide or at least more signage would definitely enhance the experience.\n\nThe entrance fee as of August 2025 was ₱150 per person, plus an environmental fee of ₱5 at the gate-very reasonable considering the conservation efforts the center supports.\n\nWhile a few animals seemed a bit stressed, and the experience felt more self-guided than interactive, seeing the Philippine Eagle in person makes the trip absolutely worth it. It's a good place for a short, educational visit, especially if you're passionate about wildlife conservation and biodiversity in the Philippines.",

            "text": "The beautiful Grandfather of all Philippine Mountains, Mt Apo!\n\nThe first day's trail was a tad forgiving but the boulder face on the 2nd day had our knees shaking... Literally! But our determination to make it to the summit remained unwavering.\n\nAnyone who attempts to reach the summit thru sta Cruz trail should prepare mentally and physically! Boulder face is no joke. It nearly drained the life out of us.. and it was only 6 in the morning! 😂\n\nAlso, prepare for unpredictable weather conditions. Tinikaran campsite and camp Reyes can both get really cold it'll make you shiver at night especially when it rains. But with the right gears, you'll be fine :)\n\nThe guides were extra helpful and considerate especially to beginners. Took an extra mile by sharing with us their drinking water. Water source to the summit from the campsite is so scarce so that's one thing one should prepare.\n\nWe were also happy to turn the climb into a learning experience for our son about the forest with its flora and fauna.   Overall, the entire experience was rewarding and worthwhile. We sincerely hope we can summit again in the future.",

At the time of our hike was amazing due to nice weather. Thank you Lord for the clearing. The organizers (i-Trekkers) were very accommodating and caring to us and they'd made us laugh all the time. Overall, it was fun and unforgettable experience in hiking Mt. Apo. 🧡❤️",
