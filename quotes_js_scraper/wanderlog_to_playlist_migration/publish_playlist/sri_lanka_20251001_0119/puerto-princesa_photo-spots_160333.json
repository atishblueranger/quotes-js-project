But that's half the fun of it.\nGet down and dirty with the locals and love it while you're at it.\nCan't recommend it enough. We'd do it again. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",

It's a cool natural feature and a fun photo spot, especially during low tide when the sandbar is fully visible.\n\nThe island is generally good for swimming, lounging, and quick stops, with shallow, calm waters and a few shaded areas to rest. There's also a small diving platform for those who want to jump into deeper water.\n\nHowever, the place clearly needs better maintenance. During our visit, there was noticeable floating marine debris along the shore, which took away from the otherwise beautiful scenery. While this might depend on tides or weather, more regular cleanup would definitely improve the experience. With increasing tourist traffic, upkeep is important to preserve the island's appeal.\n\nSnorkeling isn't ideal here, as there's not much marine life, and the island can feel crowded when multiple tour groups arrive at the same time. Facilities are basic, and there's not much to do beyond swimming and taking pictures.\n\nPros:\n•\tUnique sandbar that appears/disappears with the tide\n•\tGood for swimming and photos\n•\tQuick, convenient stop during Honda Bay tour\n\nCons:\n•\tFloating marine debris; area needs better upkeep\n•\tCrowded during peak hours\n•\tLimited activities and marine life\n\nOverall:\nLuli Island is an interesting and photogenic spot, but it would benefit greatly from more consistent maintenance and environmental care. A worthwhile part of the Honda Bay tour - just don't expect to spend too long here.",

I love going there late in the afternoon, especially just before sunset. The sea breeze, the view of the water, and the warm colors of the sky make it a peaceful and beautiful spot to just slow down and breathe.\n\nThe walkway is wide and great for casual strolls or biking, and there are usually families, couples, and tourists around-everyone enjoying the same calm vibe. There are food stalls along the area too, selling grilled seafood, street food like fish balls, and cool drinks, which makes the experience even better.\n\nWhat I appreciate is that the area feels safe and generally clean. But I do hope the city government continues to maintain it well-not just the pathway and landscaping, but also the facilities. One thing I noticed is the lack of clean, accessible restrooms. That would make a big difference for both locals and tourists. It would also be great if they could add more shaded areas or resting spots, especially for older visitors and families with kids. It gets really hot during the day, and a few more covered benches would go a long way.\n\nStill, even with those improvements needed, the Baywalk is a gem in the city. It's not commercialized or overly crowded, and that's part of its charm. It gives you a real sense of the local life in Puerto Princesa-calm, simple, and close to nature.",

Known for its white sandy beaches, crystal-clear waters, and laid-back atmosphere, the island provided the perfect escape for relaxation and exploration.\n\nAs we arrived, we were greeted by swaying palm trees and inviting beachfront cabanas. The island's small size made it easy to explore, and we found plenty of shaded areas to unwind while enjoying the cool ocean breeze. The shoreline was stunning, with gentle waves lapping against the sand, making it ideal for wading and soaking up the sun.\n\nWhile we chose to relax on the beach, other visitors from our group went snorkeling and reported that the coral viewing was excellent. They described colorful reefs teeming with marine life, making it a great spot for those interested in underwater exploration. For non-snorkelers like us, the island still offered plenty to enjoy, including beachside dining with fresh seafood and refreshing coconut drinks.\n\nThe island had a relaxed, uncrowded feel, making it a perfect getaway from the busy mainland. Whether you want to snorkel, swim, or simply unwind on a beautiful beach, Cowrie Island is a fantastic destination. I highly recommend visiting for a peaceful and scenic retreat. Even without snorkeling, the stunning views, warm waters, and tranquil vibe made this a memorable stop on our cruise excursion.",

There are plenty of starfishes around the island, but unfortunately, we saw guests lifting and throwing them, which was really sad. It would be great to have signage reminding visitors not to touch or disturb marine animals to help protect them and preserve the island's ecosystem.\n\nOverall, our stay was wonderful, and with a little more focus on conservation efforts, it could be even better for both guests and marine life.",

There are food and drink options on-site, and you can buy snacks, grilled meals, or drinks (some tour packages already include lunch here). There are also areas for volleyball and even some water activities depending on the season.\n\nWhile it's great for groups and families, it's not perfect:\n•\tThe water is calm but not very clear, especially if there are a lot of boats and swimmers.\n•\tIt can get crowded, especially during peak tourist hours or weekends.\n•\tMarine life here is minimal, so don't expect good snorkeling - it's more for relaxing than exploring underwater.\n\nStill, the overall vibe is laid-back, and the convenience of having restrooms, food, and shade makes Cowrie Island a comfortable stop for travelers looking to unwind.\n\nPros:\n•\tBest facilities among Honda Bay islands\n•\tSpacious, clean beach area\n•\tFood, drinks, and shaded huts available\n•\tGreat for families and groups\n\nCons:\n•\tNot ideal for snorkeling\n•\tCan be crowded during peak hours\n•\tWater is not as clear compared to less-developed islands\n\nOverall:\nCowrie Island is a solid, relaxing stop on the Honda Bay tour.

You will pay with the local guide and then  we road a bamboo raft to traverse the river for a few seconds  and the guide left us on our own and just instructed us to just look for the red flag and hike. It was hight tide that time so we do not know what trail we need to follow especially the sea water was high. They lack signages to pinpoint where to head and were you will find the flag to start the trek. It's a good 20-30 min walk . Just like the other observation of the other guests the people working here lack customer service skills and they do not even smile, not sure if they were tired or just wanna go home. They do not have a welcoming vibe unlike the other places we visited. They also took some photos while descending which cost 250 each and I got one since they took good photos and just got 1 for souvenir. The wuality of the picture and color plust the paper use could have been better for its price. I love the adrenaline rush and the zipline will take more tha 1 hr and 30 min. Outstanding view of the ocean and cool breeze. What an unforgetful experience. Even the person who is assisting to check for photos is not friendly. Just showed the pic with no enthusiasm at all ,once you have selected the photo our tour guide took out photo from their main office which is in our way back .After descending I was looking for the path to head back but to my surprise we need to traverse the shore it self for probably 3-5 min. It was already hightied and since I am small the water is almost up my waist from the deepest part due to waves but mostly it is up to my hip. I hope they can make bamboo bridge where people can traverse more safely especially i am securing the phone I have with me that time. I got soaked in saltwater after that and to my surprise their comfort room is paid comfort room. To think I already paid for the zipline. SMH it is too much to pay for the toilet. It should be free for all visitors. I hope they can also do some cleaning of the site and the trek to make it more appealing to the visitors. If you are up for some adventure this one is for you. Do not forget your mosquito repellant and have an extra clothing if you will do this activity.",

The descent is quite safe. There are breaks towards the end, which slows you down very quickly and effectively. The guys there also help you get out of the harness immediately. To get there, you need to take a long walk on the beach, then follow the path and climb the hill. It is a bit challenging to make a steep climb in the hot and humid weather. There are no signs up to the path, but when you see people going down the zipline, it is not hard to understand which way to go. We arranged to be picked up from the hotel around 10:00 in the morning. They told us it would take 45 minutes in total. We thought we would be back at 11:00, but it was not like that. We waited in line after climbing the hill for quite a long time. It took us about 1 minute to get down. It was short but very fun. The view was magnificent. If you have a time in Sabang, you should try zipline.",

Despite being a sanctuary, in which many were captured from a scenario which may have been worse, they are kept in poor conditions and don't seem to be treated very well. The baby crocodiles were packed into tiny bathtub shaped cages, whilst the biggest crocodiles were packed into small concrete cubes. Also, we got some nice photos of us with the small crocodiles at the end of the experience, but we're ashamed to see them being chucked and shut into a wooden box when not being held, whilst also having his mouth sellotaped shut which seemed cruel. Obviously I understand that they don't want people to leave without a finger, but if they have to be treated in such a way, maybe it's not worth the extra 60 pesos they charge for these type of photos..",

For a small fee, you can access restroom and shower facilities. However, snorkeling in Honda Bay isn't worth the time, as the reef exhibits severe damage and coral bleaching. Each island incurs separate charges, and some are unattractive, resembling construction sites rather than picturesque destinations. Cowrie Island, the most commonly visited, offers a restaurant and opportunities for sunbathing, but swimming can be risky due to jellyfish stings, with warnings posted. It's important to note that the mangroves around Palawan are breeding grounds for deadly box jellyfish.\n\nOverall, Honda Bay isn't worth a visit. The entrance and environmental fees may leave you feeling ripped off, especially considering there are better places for swimming and snorkeling elsewhere in Palawan.

It was definitely worth the price for me. You can also dine and relax at their café/restaurant, which has a 50-peso entrance fee. They'll ask you to leave your outdoor shoes before entering. My tour guide and his kid got a free ride on the giant slide since I was the only customer, and the slide only allows pairs to go at a time.",

The only downfall is on the slide, everyone just runs to the front desk and the person serves whoever is there without having any control over those who are actually standing in line. It gets a little confusing bc people are all over the place. They need to control the flow better. We also paid to get into the area across from the restaurant thinking there was an entrance fee into the place but in reality, It was only an area to relax. It wasn't much but it would've been nice to know before we paid bc we were only trying to walk to the slide.",
