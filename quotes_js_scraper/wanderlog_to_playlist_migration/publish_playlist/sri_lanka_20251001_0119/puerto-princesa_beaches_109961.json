I love going there late in the afternoon, especially just before sunset. The sea breeze, the view of the water, and the warm colors of the sky make it a peaceful and beautiful spot to just slow down and breathe.\n\nThe walkway is wide and great for casual strolls or biking, and there are usually families, couples, and tourists around-everyone enjoying the same calm vibe. There are food stalls along the area too, selling grilled seafood, street food like fish balls, and cool drinks, which makes the experience even better.\n\nWhat I appreciate is that the area feels safe and generally clean. But I do hope the city government continues to maintain it well-not just the pathway and landscaping, but also the facilities. One thing I noticed is the lack of clean, accessible restrooms. That would make a big difference for both locals and tourists. It would also be great if they could add more shaded areas or resting spots, especially for older visitors and families with kids. It gets really hot during the day, and a few more covered benches would go a long way.\n\nStill, even with those improvements needed, the Baywalk is a gem in the city. It's not commercialized or overly crowded, and that's part of its charm. It gives you a real sense of the local life in Puerto Princesa-calm, simple, and close to nature.",

It's a cool natural feature and a fun photo spot, especially during low tide when the sandbar is fully visible.\n\nThe island is generally good for swimming, lounging, and quick stops, with shallow, calm waters and a few shaded areas to rest. There's also a small diving platform for those who want to jump into deeper water.\n\nHowever, the place clearly needs better maintenance. During our visit, there was noticeable floating marine debris along the shore, which took away from the otherwise beautiful scenery. While this might depend on tides or weather, more regular cleanup would definitely improve the experience. With increasing tourist traffic, upkeep is important to preserve the island's appeal.\n\nSnorkeling isn't ideal here, as there's not much marine life, and the island can feel crowded when multiple tour groups arrive at the same time. Facilities are basic, and there's not much to do beyond swimming and taking pictures.\n\nPros:\n•\tUnique sandbar that appears/disappears with the tide\n•\tGood for swimming and photos\n•\tQuick, convenient stop during Honda Bay tour\n\nCons:\n•\tFloating marine debris; area needs better upkeep\n•\tCrowded during peak hours\n•\tLimited activities and marine life\n\nOverall:\nLuli Island is an interesting and photogenic spot, but it would benefit greatly from more consistent maintenance and environmental care. A worthwhile part of the Honda Bay tour - just don't expect to spend too long here.",

We visited the beach everyday and were very often the only people there less the locals walking to and from their boats.\n\nThe beach was clean, the water clear and so warm, like stepping into a warm bath!\n\nThere are so many fish and shallow too, my recommendation is to bring a snorkel 🤿 or snorkel mask with you so you don't miss out.\n\nAt the far right of the beach (furthest away from the harbour) you will find the corals and rock pools which are a fish haven. We were. So lucky to see so many varieties of fish and literally ankle deep, so perfect for little people to enjoy too.\n\nSwimming felt safe as it was calm, but the resorts do put flags out so do check them out for warnings.\n\nDo bring:\n* bug spray as there's reports of sand fleas although we never experienced any bites 🦟\n* sunscreen 🧴\n* snorkelling equipment 🤿\n* towels if you aren't staying at a resort locally\n* bottled drinking water 🚰\n* water shoes if exploring the rocks as they are sharp, we did ok wearing flip flops 🩴",

There's a small market for some seafood which they can actually cook for you. We had fruits for dessert with their local yellow sweet watermelon and pineapple. Bring a lot of sunblock, wide brimmed hats and your own cold water if possible as the heat can really be a beast especially at noon time. Cellphone signal can be intermittent. Luli island was our first stop, it had a small sandbar strip as it was high tide then. There were also floating cottages where you can chill if you choose not to swim.

            "text": "During our cruise boat excursion, we had the chance to visit Cowrie Island, a tropical paradise near Puerto Princesa, Palawan. Known for its white sandy beaches, crystal-clear waters, and laid-back atmosphere, the island provided the perfect escape for relaxation and exploration.\n\nAs we arrived, we were greeted by swaying palm trees and inviting beachfront cabanas. The island's small size made it easy to explore, and we found plenty of shaded areas to unwind while enjoying the cool ocean breeze. The shoreline was stunning, with gentle waves lapping against the sand, making it ideal for wading and soaking up the sun.\n\nWhile we chose to relax on the beach, other visitors from our group went snorkeling and reported that the coral viewing was excellent. They described colorful reefs teeming with marine life, making it a great spot for those interested in underwater exploration. For non-snorkelers like us, the island still offered plenty to enjoy, including beachside dining with fresh seafood and refreshing coconut drinks.\n\nThe island had a relaxed, uncrowded feel, making it a perfect getaway from the busy mainland. Whether you want to snorkel, swim, or simply unwind on a beautiful beach, Cowrie Island is a fantastic destination. I highly recommend visiting for a peaceful and scenic retreat. Even without snorkeling, the stunning views, warm waters, and tranquil vibe made this a memorable stop on our cruise excursion.",

The waters are crystal clear, perfect for swimming and relaxing.\n\nHowever, one thing that should be improved is visitor awareness of marine life. There are plenty of starfishes around the island, but unfortunately, we saw guests lifting and throwing them, which was really sad. It would be great to have signage reminding visitors not to touch or disturb marine animals to help protect them and preserve the island's ecosystem.\n\nOverall, our stay was wonderful, and with a little more focus on conservation efforts, it could be even better for both guests and marine life.",

            "text": "Cowrie Island is usually the final and most relaxing stop on the Honda Bay island-hopping tour - and for good reason. Among the islands in the area, it's the most developed, with decent facilities like cottages, restrooms, dining areas, and massage huts, making it ideal for resting and enjoying a lazy afternoon by the beach.\n\nThe shoreline is wide and clean, with plenty of space to swim, lounge, or just hang out under a nipa hut. There are food and drink options on-site, and you can buy snacks, grilled meals, or drinks (some tour packages already include lunch here). There are also areas for volleyball and even some water activities depending on the season.\n\nWhile it's great for groups and families, it's not perfect:\n•\tThe water is calm but not very clear, especially if there are a lot of boats and swimmers.\n•\tIt can get crowded, especially during peak tourist hours or weekends.\n•\tMarine life here is minimal, so don't expect good snorkeling - it's more for relaxing than exploring underwater.\n\nStill, the overall vibe is laid-back, and the convenience of having restrooms, food, and shade makes Cowrie Island a comfortable stop for travelers looking to unwind.\n\nPros:\n•\tBest facilities among Honda Bay islands\n•\tSpacious, clean beach area\n•\tFood, drinks, and shaded huts available\n•\tGreat for families and groups\n\nCons:\n•\tNot ideal for snorkeling\n•\tCan be crowded during peak hours\n•\tWater is not as clear compared to less-developed islands\n\nOverall:\nCowrie Island is a solid, relaxing stop on the Honda Bay tour. It may not offer the most pristine waters, but its comfort and convenience make it a good place to end your island-hopping day on a chill note.",

Tony can pick you up and drive you but only two time a day, when you want to chill is quite hard to know when you want to go home or have a dinner or breakfast, but for us there was no problem , there are trycicles on the beach. Some osom people always on the beach just interact ;))) one more minus is that from 6 in the morning you can hear a lot of motorbikes going to the beach and back ;) but it's cozy and wild experience, depend of what you are looking ;))",

But I don't suggest you go swim on the beach because I don't think it's clean enough considering there are nearly residential homes. But you may rent a boat and go to the nearest sandbar.  They have double decker boats that ranges from 1,500 to 2,000 per day.  They also have smaller ones for 1,000.00.  I just stayed there for fresh air but the area looks abandoned and needs to be developed.  It can be found at the far end of Wescom road.  You'll never thought there is a place like that in the City unless you are from that area.",

Windy and a foggy distance. The waves are pretty huge and scary and the locals don't recommend going too far into the water.\nThere are some locals that teach surfing and swimming lessons which is great the fact that the waves in this beach are huge.\n\nOverall it's a nice place to relax and enjoy the calm beach. 7/10",
