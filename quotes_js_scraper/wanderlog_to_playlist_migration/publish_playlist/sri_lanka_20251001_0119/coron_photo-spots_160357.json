There is not much room so you have to go one by one.\n\nOnce the crowds came it was really hard to leave as people kept on coming down into the second lagoon.\n\nThere are jet streams of warm water in the lagoon as well which was cool.

It is only good for soaking and not for swimming. The good thing is there are rules around to follow. Besides that, the place also has mangroves which is overlooking the sea. The hot spring is relaxing after a very long day. Make sure to bring extra clothes for changing or a towel as it can get uncomfortable commuting when still wet. The best time to visit is when the sun starts to set so it would not be too hot for the hot spring.",

The trail can be a bit slippery, and the stones are sharp, though wooden stairs have been installed to make the ascent easier. The view at the top is absolutely worth the effort. Along the way, the tour guide will pay a local fee for tourists, and as visitors, it's important to respect and follow the area's rules. You'll also encounter some dogs along the path while they are used to people, they can be a little intimidating, so be cautious, and hopefully, the owner will be nearby. Locals also sell drinks and snacks, so it's a good idea to bring money in case you'd like to purchase something. Kayangan Lake's water is 70% fresh and 30% seawater, so be mindful while swimming. Always stay close to your tour guide for safety, as the area is considered sacred by some locals who believe in spirits, or \"engkanto,\" that protect the place. Avoid venturing too deep, especially since it's not entirely seawater, and you may not be able to ascend as quickly, similar to Barracuda Lake.",

On top, there's a tall metal cross, the Coron signage, a waiting shade area, and concrete benches to rest and enjoy the beautiful scenery.\n\nThe concrete steps going up are mostly shaded by trees, and there are also roofed shelters for short breaks, making the climb more pleasant.\n\nIt's better to climb in the early morning or late afternoon. Remember to bring water, wear sun protection, and be prepared to be sweaty going up.",

            "text": "This is not a report from a sour grape...it is simply the bare facts and truth that I myself and hundreds of other foreign tourist have experienced recently about the terrible destinations being pushed by local authorities in Coron Palawan!\n\nBe aware that several islands are being included in an island hopping tour from Coron. One of those islands is Bulog Dos Island. You have the option of taking a group island hopping tour for 1,900 pesos each, (about 20 people per group). Or take a private tour for 5,000 pesos per person. The organizers will tell you it is about an hour and half travel time, one way, to the first island in the tour, but the truth is it will take every bit of 2 hours plus! Then after paying 10,000 pesos for a private tour for two people traveling 2 hours in a pump boat, you arrive at Bulog Dos. The second island in the tour is nothing more than a sand bar, (Ditaytayan Island), and the third island is a local garbage dump, (Malcapuya Island).\n\nNow don't get me wrong...on Bulog Dos there is a very small, narrow stretch of white sand and the water was amazingly beautiful...(like hundreds, if not thousands of other beaches in Coron)...but other than that, there is absolutely NOTHING at this island!\n\nOK...let me get this straight...I paid 10,000 pesos for two people to sit on a hard wooden seat in a little pump boat, for more than two hours of travel, (one way), passing up dozens and dozens of other beautiful beaches with great swimming and snorkeling just to go to Bulog Dos Island and find absolutely nothing there, along with stops at a sand bar and a trash dump...nothing special, no great views, no special attractions, nothing...just places to stop and swim next to all the dead trees and trash for large amounts of money paid?\n\nAn island hopping tour is supposed to be a small group of islands with special or unique destinations or attractions that offer one of a kind memories...not just another swimming hole\n\nDon't be a victim!!!!! There is nothing wrong with island hopping tours but in my vastly experienced travel around the World, Bulog Dos was the most worthless island destination of all time!!!!!\n\nThe people who operate this island will probably not like this review...but I tell the truth no matter how painful it might be!",
