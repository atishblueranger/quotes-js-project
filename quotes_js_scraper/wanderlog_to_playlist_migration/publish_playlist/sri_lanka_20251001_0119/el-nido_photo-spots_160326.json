From the moment we stepped on board, the tour guide and the entire crew made us feel so welcome and taken care of. They were all so friendly and created such a fun, happy atmosphere for the whole trip.\n\nThe scenery was just breathtaking. We snorkeled in so many beautiful spots and relaxed on pristine white sand beaches. Getting to walk through a classic Filipino village was a really special experience. I was also impressed with how clean and neat our cabins were. One of the best parts was the food-it was delicious, and they made sure we never went hungry, with plenty of snacks and drinks always available. The evening karaoke with all the guests and crew was hilarious and such a great way to bond!\n\nOur group of 12 felt like the perfect size for the boat, creating a nice, intimate vibe. The only downside was that one cabin didn't have a fan, which made it uncomfortably hot for sleeping. Aside from that, it was a truly wonderful trip, and I would do it again in a heartbeat.",

The food was a real highlight - fresh, tasty, and varied throughout the cruise.\n\nThe crew was kind and welcoming, although we would have appreciated more background information or stories about the places we visited - a bit more context would have made the experience even richer.\n\nThe boat was fully booked (30 guests), so it did feel a bit tight at times, especially during meals or when everyone was on board.\n\nDespite those small points, it was a very enjoyable trip and one I would definitely recommend.

A nice surprise for us was that there were lots of butterflies on these flowering trees. In the water that's not too deep, we even saw many clownfish. I was very happy as I'm not a good swimmer and still panic in deep water even with life jacket on. But here, I could snorkel for a long time in relatively shallow water with lots of sea life to see. The water was quite calm as well so it's a good place for beginners to snorkel. We hired kayak for 600php from Corong-corong beach (no time limit) so you can take your time here in Papaya beach, Lapus lapus beach and Seven commando beach. The only downside at Papaya beach was that there were lots of small jellyfish so I felt a small sting here and there but no harm done.",

During our trip, the tide was high and the waves were quite strong, making the entrance a bit tricky. You have to kneel or crouch down to squeeze through the narrow opening, and I even got a small wound on my knees along the way.\n\nOnce inside, the lagoon itself was smaller than expected, and there wasn't much space to stand , probably because of the tide at the time. But despite the challenging entry, the experience was still magical. The hidden beauty of the place, surrounded by towering limestone cliffs, made it all worth it.\n\nIt's a raw, natural adventure, not the most comfortable, but definitely memorable. Just be prepared and wear proper footwear!",

There were 2 of us. We paid a total of 12,000 pp. We also paid 300 pp for kayaking. The reason we bought a private tour was that it departed earlier in the morning and we wanted to see the big lagoon when it was quiet before anyone else arrived. We also wanted to visit the island we wanted on the private tour. We left the land at 08.30 in the morning. First, we went to the big lagoon. The boats anchor outside the lagoon. You need to rent kayaks to get inside. We rented kayaks for 2 people and there were very few people there as we wanted and it was worth it. It is a real natural wonder. We spent about 1.5 hours there. Since it was very hot even at that hour, I recommend wearing a hat, sunglasses, sunscreen and a rash guard if you wish.

They had the option to also do the other Dreamcatcher portion for an additional cost, where you crawl around on this rope netting hung across the cliff but we decided not to do that. You have to wear safety climbing type gear. Pretty good hike up into the limestone cliff. They have a metal staircase structure part of the way. The bottom half is a climb up rock and dirt stairs and oath that can be difficult for elderly people.  It takes about 15 minutes to hike to top and the view is great. There weren't many people there at the time so we had the place to ourselves.  I would say it is worthwhile to do this walk if you are in El Nido town and have an hour or so of free time.",

We liked the beach very much. See the first photos. When the island hopping boats are gone, the beach is very quiet. Swimming is easy there. One must be careful when swimming if the boats are returning, but it's generally okay. The boats approach the shore carefully, disembark the guests, and immediately leave.\nThere are lots of other beaches around which are accessible from land or via island hopping tours. They are all beautiful. I must say I was pretty impressed with the El Nido beach. In the evenings, after dinner, it was nice to walk on the beach.\nFull sunset, however, isn't observable from the beach due to the hill there. But no worries, nearby beach which everyone goes is great to enjoy the sunset.",

You'll also cross a suspension bridge that adds an additional thrill. Well worth the visit if you're in El Nido and offers a nice contrast to the numerous beach boat tours.",

There is a suspension bridge which rocks a bit but otherwise seems safe enough and you are tied in with a harness for this part. The rest is a staircase of scaffolding with open mesh flooring. If you are scared of heights the mesh flooring could be daunting but it seemed very stable. I would recommend it if you want to have a Birds Eye view of El Nido, great for a photo at the top.",

Still, if you take it for what it is-an easy and structured canopy walk with a scenic viewpoint-it's a pleasant experience. I did it solo and found it to be a nice break from the usual boat tours. The first part is a bit steep and could be tiring if you're not in shape, but overall the trail is short and manageable. The view from the top is rewarding, and the whole activity takes about an hour. Not a must-do, but I don't regret it, worth it if you're looking for something different to do in El Nido.",
