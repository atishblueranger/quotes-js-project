He was waiting near the top, on the approach to the bottom of the waterfall, and asked if I wanted to see the hidden waterfalls. As a solo female traveller, I was a little hesistant to go into the jungle with him, but I'd seen a review from someone on here about their experience so I decided to go ahead. He also spoke Tamil, so I could communicate well with him. It was the best decision ever! We hiked through the jungle and discovered so many hidden waterfalls. He took plenty of photos for me and we ended up at the top of the Lover's Leap Waterfall, looking down on everyone else! It was a surreal experience that lasted about 2 hours. Just a little warning that it was physically challenging, but Yoga helped me climb the larger rocks. I wasn't really sure how much to give him in return for his time as he doesn't request a specific amount, but ended up deciding on 10,000LKR as I was on a budget trip. He told my that past tourists had given him his camera phone too. So sweet!",

Caution recommended. The environment looks stunning, enjoy in distance. It was sliightly over-crowded during a Sunday. The tracking trail was dangerous and slippery. Take a water bottle for you and take the empty back. Keep an umbrella. Do not get fed-up seeing the first two hundred steep steps. The walk worth the experience.",
