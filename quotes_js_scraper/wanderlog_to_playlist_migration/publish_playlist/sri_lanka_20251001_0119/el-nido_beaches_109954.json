From the moment we stepped on board, the tour guide and the entire crew made us feel so welcome and taken care of. They were all so friendly and created such a fun, happy atmosphere for the whole trip.\n\nThe scenery was just breathtaking. We snorkeled in so many beautiful spots and relaxed on pristine white sand beaches. Getting to walk through a classic Filipino village was a really special experience. I was also impressed with how clean and neat our cabins were. One of the best parts was the food-it was delicious, and they made sure we never went hungry, with plenty of snacks and drinks always available. The evening karaoke with all the guests and crew was hilarious and such a great way to bond!\n\nOur group of 12 felt like the perfect size for the boat, creating a nice, intimate vibe. The only downside was that one cabin didn't have a fan, which made it uncomfortably hot for sleeping. Aside from that, it was a truly wonderful trip, and I would do it again in a heartbeat.",

To apologize and make it up to us, Sea Quest offered to each guest an extra day of choice on a boat expedition.

The food was a real highlight - fresh, tasty, and varied throughout the cruise.\n\nThe crew was kind and welcoming, although we would have appreciated more background information or stories about the places we visited - a bit more context would have made the experience even richer.\n\nThe boat was fully booked (30 guests), so it did feel a bit tight at times, especially during meals or when everyone was on board.\n\nDespite those small points, it was a very enjoyable trip and one I would definitely recommend.

A nice surprise for us was that there were lots of butterflies on these flowering trees. In the water that's not too deep, we even saw many clownfish. I was very happy as I'm not a good swimmer and still panic in deep water even with life jacket on. But here, I could snorkel for a long time in relatively shallow water with lots of sea life to see. The water was quite calm as well so it's a good place for beginners to snorkel. We hired kayak for 600php from Corong-corong beach (no time limit) so you can take your time here in Papaya beach, Lapus lapus beach and Seven commando beach. The only downside at Papaya beach was that there were lots of small jellyfish so I felt a small sting here and there but no harm done.",

The fine golden sand blends with vibrant turquoise waters, creating a scene worthy of a postcard.\n\nFrom a comfortable hammock, with your feet buried in the sand and the waves gently lapping your ankles, the spectacle is unparalleled. The view opens onto a horizon dotted with islands, their silhouettes seemingly delicately painted against the endless blue of the ocean. The sea breeze caresses your skin, and the rhythmic sound of the waves completes the symphony of this natural refuge.\n\nUnlike other crowded beaches, tranquility reigns here. The towering trees that reach the shore offer generous shade, inviting rest and contemplation.  The walk along the beach to Cabañas Bleach is a true delight: the swaying of the palm trees, the birdsong, and the sensation of walking on soft sand make the walk an almost magical experience.\n\nTo enjoy this paradise even more, there's nothing better than relaxing at the beach bar and restaurant, where you can rent sun loungers and enjoy a refreshing drink or a delicious meal. The place is magnificent, with a welcoming atmosphere and impeccable service. The waiters, always friendly and professional, make each visit an even more pleasant experience, especially Rafael, Mark, Kristel, Raymond, whose attentiveness and warmth leave a lasting impression on every visitor.\n\nAs evening falls, the sunset unfolds its magic. The sky is tinged with shades of gold, orange, and pink, reflecting off the water like a moving canvas. It's a spectacle worth enjoying slowly, allowing every nuance and reflection to be etched in your memory.\n\nFor the more adventurous, the zip line offers a unique perspective. Gliding over the beach and admiring the immensity of the landscape from above is an exciting and unforgettable experience. From the air, the beauty of this paradise is revealed in all its splendor, with the beach stretching out like a golden tapestry and the turquoise waters shimmering in the sun.\n\nMareme Gmeg Bleach is not just a beach; it's a destination for the senses, a gift from nature that invites you to unwind, explore, and, above all, enjoy beauty in its purest form.",

We liked the beach very much. See the first photos. When the island hopping boats are gone, the beach is very quiet. Swimming is easy there. One must be careful when swimming if the boats are returning, but it's generally okay. The boats approach the shore carefully, disembark the guests, and immediately leave.\nThere are lots of other beaches around which are accessible from land or via island hopping tours. They are all beautiful. I must say I was pretty impressed with the El Nido beach. In the evenings, after dinner, it was nice to walk on the beach.\nFull sunset, however, isn't observable from the beach due to the hill there. But no worries, nearby beach which everyone goes is great to enjoy the sunset.",

Its shallow, calm waters are perfect for swimming and snorkeling, with vibrant coral reefs just off the shore.\n\nWhat sets Entalula apart is its relatively uncrowded nature, despite being a popular stop on tours.

The rooms was very spacious and could easily have fitted more than the four beds. The room had A/C and a ceiling fan, so it was really nice to be able to have a higher temperature on the A/C and use the fan to circulate air. Each bunk had a locker and the hostel even provided a lock. Each bunk had privacy curtains, a private light, a thin blanket and a towel. Check bunk also had a plenty of storage attached to the bunk if you didn't want to put stuff in the locker. There were plenty of sockets, but were located about half way up a wall, so it was harder to use if on the upper bunk. The mattress felt like they were extra wide than a single and were very comfortable. Another oddity is that the upper section of the walls have windows facing out into the hallway, which is lit at night. I had a sleep mask, so I was less bothered.\n\nThere was I think one shared bathroom with 5 toilets and 4 showers. The toilers were generally clean, but the number of people using them meant that they should've been cleaned more often. The showers were fine except that 3 had broken soap/shampoo dispensers and always filled.\n\nBreakfast was provided and the options were a cut above the standard offered in other hostels. The staff even make pancakes and omelettes fresh. Fresh fruits, toasts, tea, juice and coffees are also available.\n\nLocation wise, the hostel is located about 5 minutes walk from from the main centre, but that's fine for me as I prefer to be away from the noise.\n\nOverall, I had an excellent stay. The staff are magnificent and provide impeccable service. The design and services offered by the hostel is a cut above. However, the aforementioned annoyances meant I dinged one star.",

The toilets and showered are shared but there are plenty of them. We ate lunch and dinner here. We had the chicken sandwich as well as the chicken rice bowl and margarita pizza and it was delicious! The rice bowl did say boneless chicken thigh and it did come on the bone but I was okay with that, there was still plenty of meat there. The prices were very reasonably for the quality too! The staff were super friendly and attentive. The location is a little far out from El Nido town however the tricycles take you down to town for only 100 pesos making it bearable.

We stayed for a week, and somehow, each day topped the last.\n\nThe highlight for me was without a doubt the staff. Every single person working there goes above and beyond to make the space feel like home. You can tell they genuinely care and take pride in creating a welcoming, fun, and supportive atmosphere. It felt less like a hostel and more like a vibrant little community.\n\nThe views are unmatched-watching the sunset every evening with a cold (and affordable!) drink in hand, surrounded by new friends, was something we'll never forget. The nightly events and activities were all super well thought-out and an absolute blast. Whether you're traveling solo or as a couple, it's such an easy place to meet people and make memories.\n\nWe're already dreaming of coming back.

From the moment we arrived, we were welcomed with genuine warmth and hospitality that made us feel like we were right at home-only with a view of paradise!\n\nThe beach club itself is stunning, with a laid-back yet chic vibe that's perfect for relaxing with friends or enjoying a romantic sunset. The views of Bacuit Bay are breathtaking, especially as the sun dips below the horizon-truly one of the best spots to catch the sunset in El Nido.\n\nThe drinks were top-notch-creative, refreshing, and perfectly crafted. We especially loved sipping on cocktails by the beach while soaking in the relaxed atmosphere and groovy tunes. The paella was a highlight of our visit-flavorful, hearty, and clearly inspired by authentic Spanish recipes. It was the perfect dish to share and paired beautifully with their house sangria.\n\nBut what truly made our experience stand out was the incredible staff. Every team member was friendly and attentive, but a special shoutout goes to Ed, who went above and beyond to ensure we felt welcome and well taken care of. His warmth, charisma, and attention to detail really made the experience feel like home away from home.\n\nIf you're in El Nido and looking for a place that combines stunning views, great food and drinks, and amazing hospitality, Panorama Beach Club is an absolute must-visit.",

The day before, we were also at Panorama, and there were only 3 other guests in total. We had some drinks and snacks and were lying on the front row of sunbeds.\n\nToday, we decided to go back to Panorama. When we arrived, there were 7 crew members just hanging around because there was absolutely nothing to do. We were planning to have a nice dinner and some drinks, and I walked over to the sunbeds, not knowing what scene would unfold later.\n\nThe crew immediately approached me to say that their supervisor had instructed them it was not allowed for us to use the sunbeds without paying for them. The day before, they had let it slide (I had no idea there was even a charge), but now I really had to pay.\n\nIf it were high season, I'd understand, but during low season - when we were literally the only guests that afternoon - I would be happy if a customer wanted to spend money on food and drinks at the club. And let's be honest, it all looks nice, but it's obviously not Ushuaïa in Ibiza, where I'd happily drop a few thousand euros on a VIP table.\n\nNaturally, we left immediately without spending a single peso.\n\nAdvice to Panorama: try to appreciate the few guests you get during the off-season.",

My advice is don't bother. There are a couple of concrete effigies of Jesus, a concrete statue of Mary, a bizarrely constrasting concrete effigy of Marcos, and some unfinished ruins of buildings. They clearly need the money to complete the construction works, so there is absolutely no need for you to contribute to the building costs. We loved Tour C, and the natural world we experienced with the beaches, views and photo opportunities. In my opinion you can skip Matinloc Shrine and you haven't missed anything. Oh it does have a lovely viewpoint between the rocks from up fairly high. That's the only nice part though, and not even worth 40 pesos never mind 200 pesos. I have genuinely no idea how this tourist attraction is getting nearly 5 star reviews on Google.  Hope this helps!",

Saying that \"the stay here is worth it\" is an understatement!  First of all, the location, the aesthetic of the resort, and the island itself is one of the most beautiful places that you can go to in El Nido! Conveniently located at the seven commando beach, when the tourists are not there the location itself makes it almost exclusive. The clarity and the color of the water itself is beautiful and specially during the sunny days you just can't help but swim. They offer free kayaking and snorkeling and the coral formations down below are outstanding and the fishes were pretty too. The mountain ranges were Instagram able and the sunset was amazing.\n\nAll the staffs and the personnel were really hospitable. From the arrival itself the airport pickup was helpful. Then when we arrived at the bay area, Captain Fiddy and Roy carried our big luggages while it was raining and even kept it from touching the ground and the sea shore. He was a great captain and our speedboat travel was really comfortable even though it was raining hard during our arrival. At the shore when we arrived, we were already being greeted by ALL the staffs and they were waving at us from afar! They were waving for about 5-10 minutes even when we were not there yet, and when we arrived they even helped us and washed the sands from our feet. Now that's premium service! And even the dogs were welcoming too. There were resident dacshunds: max and zorro, and some other dogs as well (Pedo, Brownie, Bella). Ed and Fran ushered us perfectly into our room and explained everything well.\n\nComing to the room itself, we can immediately feel the serenity and the lux vibe. It was a mixture of tropical and luxury essence. There was a custom welcoming board/ leaf and we felt more welcomed.\n\nThen come the lunch time and dinner time. The food was perfect and we couldn't pick any flaw from it. The chef was really talented and the food was really great. As they say, chef's kiss! We also availed for the romantic dinner which was supposedly by the seashore. It was raining hard though but they made some adjustments and still made a romantic arrangement at the view deck.\n\nLast but not the least, Bambi was one of the most amazing managers/ staff. He was really polite, attentive to our needs and friendly. He was great all around and it felt like he was a personal friend. He even went kayaking with us while we were snorkeling too.\n\nTL;DR: if you are looking for an exclusive place to stay in El Nido, this is one of the sweetest spots.

From the moment we arrived, the staff welcomed us with incredible warmth, presenting us with beautiful shell necklaces and a refreshing welcome drink before guiding us to a private, candlelit dinner on the beach, complete with tiki torches.\n\nThe resort looks just like the pictures online-if not better-and the team here is outstanding. Everyone was exceptionally kind, attentive, and genuinely went above and beyond to ensure our comfort. Having traveled to 22 countries, I've never encountered such a high level of luxury and exclusivity.\n\nNo detail was missed in our sea villa. The staff personally carried our bags to the room, which was perfectly prepared with a handmade sign and matching beautiful flowers. The villa itself was spacious, featuring an outdoor daybed and a balcony with direct access to the beach. The views from the bedroom were simply breathtaking.\nThe food was incredible, especially the breakfast, which was delivered to our villa so we could enjoy it in privacy while taking in the beach views.\n\nThe resort is located on the famous Seven Commando Beach. While many visitors come here to explore, guests at Vellago have the privilege of their own private beach area with a comfortable cabana. I highly recommend taking advantage of the complimentary snorkeling and kayaking.\n\nIf you're considering booking, don't hesitate. This is truly a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Our stay was unforgettable, made even more special by the amazing staff. A huge thank you to Bambi and Rozel for making our trip so comfortable and memorable.",
