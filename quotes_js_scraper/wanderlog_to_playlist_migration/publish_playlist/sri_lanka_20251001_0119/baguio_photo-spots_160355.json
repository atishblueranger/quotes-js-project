It was church #21 out of our 52 for the year, and this one stopped us in our tracks.\n\nThe twin spires rising above Session Road, the soft pink façade, and the sweeping steps leading up-it looked like a postcard. But once inside, it was the silence that got me. Amid the stained glass and hushed prayers, my wife and I watched our three girls light candles beneath the statue of Our Lady of Atonement.\n\nThey didn't speak. They just stood in stillness-rare, beautiful stillness.\n\nFor a dad, moments like that linger.\n\nThis cathedral wasn't just impressive-it was calming. It reminded me that amid our noisy schedules and long drives, grace still finds us in quiet corners. Church #21 left a mark. Not just because of how it looked, but because of how it made us feel: grateful, grounded, and just a little more whole.",

By day, the atmosphere can be peaceful and tranquil, perfect for a relaxing escape from the city's hustle and bustle. The iconic man-made lake at the center of the park is a major draw, where visitors can enjoy leisurely boat rides in rowboats or swan-shaped paddle boats. I think most of the boats cost 200 pesos for 30 minutes. Even if you're going solo or with a group, it's fun to row around the lake. Beyond the lake, the park buzzes with life. You can rent bicycles of all kinds, from single bikes to tandem bikes, and pedal along the designated paths. The open spaces are ideal for a picnic, jogging, or simply strolling through the beautiful Rose Garden and other landscaped areas. At night, the park's ambiance transforms. A portion of Harrison Road, adjacent to the park, closes to traffic and becomes the famous Baguio Night Market. The area fills with stalls selling a vast assortment of goods, from thrifted clothes and souvenirs to local handicrafts. It's a bustling hub for bargain hunters. The air also fills with the delicious aromas of various street foods, making the night market a must-visit for a lively culinary adventure. The park's dynamic nature ensures there's something to enjoy from morning till late evening.",

You'll find a variety of souvenir shops, food stalls, plants for sale, and even a photo-op spot with a horse-very touristy, but fun if you're into that.\n\nHowever, the observation deck itself has seen better days. It was packed when we went, making it tough to get a clean photo without a sea of heads in the background. It also doesn't look like it's been well-maintained lately, which is a bit of a letdown.\n\nThat said, the view is still beautiful.

We loved the native huts and Igorot statues - very educational for the kids and a great photo opportunity for the whole family.\n\nIt's also nice that there are shaded areas to rest and clean comfort rooms available. Entrance fee is very affordable, making it a great spot for budget-friendly family bonding. Don't forget to try the street food and souvenir stalls outside too!\n\nOverall, a must-visit when you're in Baguio - perfect for nature lovers, families, and those looking for peaceful moments in the city of pines. 🌲💚",

            "text": "The Baguio City Botanical Garden is a great destination, but I have to be honest, it could be so much better than what it is. It seems to be suffering from an identity crisis: it doesn't know if it wants to be a garden or an amusement park. Instead of focusing on being a true botanical garden, there are rides and artificial “Instagrammable” features (metal+plastic or concrete structures and fake animals) scattered throughout and dominate the park.  There is a carousel smack dab in the middle of the Korean garden. There is a pair of giant boots in the tala garden. They have no relevance to the area where they were placed. I understand the need to draw people in through the gates, but it seems the park is focused more on entertaining less on informing. Many visitors are more interested in taking pictures in front of the steel-and-wire giant teddy bear instead of the beautiful plants and flowers around them. There is a map that shows the different sections of the park, but additional informational signs are sorely lacking. There is a “Japanese Tunnel Walk” but that's all it says. Nothing says that it is one of the many tunnels the Japanese forces dug throughout the city during WWII to hide munitions. I overheard a boy asking his mom, “Mom, why is the name of this place ‘botanical' garden?” The mom's answer: “Because it's botanical.” It made me sad. It's not wrong to entertain, but it's possible to entertain and teach at the same time. An informed Filipino is a better Filipino. IMHO.",

I should've biked here when the road was closed.\n\nWhat I love about this is there's no entrance fee, and you can take pictures of the statue free of charge. However, there are sections of the area when use with their props, you gotta pay them.\n\nThere are a lot of stores and stalls: ice cream vendors, souvenirs, food, and props for rent for picture taking.

Before or after visiting the Stone Kingdom which is often crowded, you can enjoy a more realistic mountain dwellers village.\n\n2. This tourist spot showcases different types of village huts, beliefs, traditions and rituals of the mountain people. There is also a mini museum which displays paintings, figures and artifacts.\n\n3. You can also enter one of the huts, but you have to observe the rules. A group of dancers wearing traditional Igorot clothing performs traditional dances for the tourists.\n\nThe entrance fee is 100 pesos as of dec 2024 for adults it might change today. You have to climb and trek uphill to explore the village. The village is a forest itself and the steps are a bit slippery so be careful trodding uphill or downhill. You can enjoy the nature vibe while learning about the history and culture of the Igorots.",

But guys trust me the ethnicity vibes there is giving! I think it needs more support and advertising because it have a lot of potential and reminds us the ethic preservation. Best tip advice I suggest to drop-off here first before going down to Igorot Stone Kingdom for a 5min walk only or if you're from ISK try here and there's a Karendirya right beside TAM-AWAN VILLAGE serving Local food that you must really try too🫰🏻♥️🥰",

The overall vibe and the food made it a wonderful experience.\n\nWe were lucky it was just beside the hotel we were staying at. Getting here can take a bit of effort since it's located away from the city.\n\nThe restaurant is spacious, with three floors, and has outdoor seating that overlooks the mountains and pine trees. It's the perfect place to unwind and enjoy a meal, especially breakfast.\n\nThey offer a wide variety of dishes, and the food we ordered was worth the price and completely satisfied my cravings.\n\nWhat I loved most about this place is the library. I was surprised by the selection of books they had. If I had more time, I would've loved to just read and relax there.\n\nThe staff were also very accommodating and friendly. The atmosphere inside makes you feel like everyone is a friend. 🍃\n\nAlso, their dessert is worth the try!!",

Just note that each ticket is per head/person payment.\n\nThere were a handful of areas to visit following different trails, but all were special in their own way; the view of the sky, the rustling trees, and of course, the fresh mountain air.\n\nThe coffee shop within the park, Casey Beans, was the only one open. Although it's a small shop and had a simple menu, the foods and drinks were amazing; we were even surprised in how affordable they were!\n\nAs for accessibility, there are some comfort rooms for some areas, although they are not very far from each other. And prepare to have a bit of endurance since you need to walk a couple of stairs to go through each part.\n\nIf you are a nature lover or just thinking of visiting here, you'd probably need about half a day, maybe alone or with someone. Greatly recommended for anyone who wants to relieve their stress, hang out, or just want to have a little bit of tranquility.\n\nOverall, would definitely go again. We had a great time 🥰",

And our order is still not served so we walk away.\nSo when i got back in Baguio we tried to go super early. There was no one outside waiting and so many empty seats inside, but we were still told to wait - a clear sign this restaurant really lacks manpower. Hope we can call out the owner for this.\nRecommend going here super early in the morning like 7am.\nFood - the reviews were very true, everything we ordered tastes good and healthy. Even the coffee was superb with classic local sweetener and not your usual commercialized white sugar. Your order also comes with fresh fruits\nPrice - little bit pricey on the side but definitely worth it.\nAmbiance - very homey and laidback.\nStaff - courteus and helpful\n** TIP - if your coming here and already hungry, eat somewhere else. Timing and patience is key. They are understaffed so bring a little more kindness to them.",

I love how the design of the museum accentuates its unique location and cultural objects, and vice versa.\n\nI learned so much from the text of the exhibits, and seeing the fabrics in real life, up close, in all their glory added so much to the learning experience. There was also a UP Press bookstore upstairs, I think?, from which I bought 2 books about the Cordillera that I've only seen in this UP CU location.\n\nFor adult museum-goers who love art, history, our country, or all of the above, I highly recommend visiting Museo Kordilyera.

But if you wish to explore more, there's an area with an entrance fee (optional). One downside, but hasn't affected my rating, is the location. It's best to be traveled by own car. I don't think there's public transportation available in the area.\n\nAnother thing (beneficial for those traveling with children), a place that not everyone might have seen, is a playground situated near a parking space. It's open for the public. Will surely entertain children for free.",

It's just such a breath of fresh air, literally!\n\nWhat I loved most was just being surrounded by all the trees and lush landscapes. There are so many spots where you can just take it all in, whether you're looking for a peaceful stroll or a more energetic walk. The air feels so much cleaner up there, and it's just incredibly calming to be away from the city hustle. We spent hours just wandering around, discovering different paths and enjoying the quiet. If you're someone who appreciates nature and getting your steps in, Camp John Hay is definitely your kind of place.\n\nMy only little thought for improvement, especially since so many tourists like us love to stroll, is that some of the sidewalks could really use being a bit wider. There were times when it felt a little cramped, especially if there were a few groups walking at once. Given how popular walking and enjoying the outdoors is here, making more room for pedestrians would make the experience even better for everyone.",

            "text": "I went to Foggy Mountain Cookhouse in late April 2024. As an American traveling to the Philippines for the first time it was complicated but well worth the complexity of getting there. For foreigners trying to dine here there are some things you must know. The accessibility of the place is somewhat limited in terms of parking. The day you plan to go I recommend taking a taxi. There are many reputable taxi services in Baguio available on Facebook. Facebook is also how you will make your reservation and order in advance. It is a policy to order in advance to ensure availability. At least the time of year I went. It was not exactly tourist season so my date and I were the only ones in the restaurant. It was really lovely, it was as if I had rented out the whole place to ourselves. We were greeted by our waiter and he showed us to a table outside with a great view of the mountain. As the evening carried on the fog rolled in and soon it was just us. Although the view is less impressive in the fog it is still very beautiful seeing the lights from the adjacent mountain. Some mosquitoes came out and the waiter was very accommodating and put out two cups with about 15 mosquito incense sticks to repel them. We were given a buzzer to ring our waiter to take orders or ask for anything specific. I was at first a little confused but to make a long story short, after our dinner we learned that Chef Babes was on Vacation and his Sous Chef was both our Chef and Waiter. He was absolutely incredible and he cooked everything to perfection. I would love to come again to have some of Chef Babes food, but what we had was hands down the best meal I have had in my life. We had an appetizer of spaghetti, my date got the Steak cooked medium well and I got the Lamb Shank. The Lamb was one of the most tender and succulent pieces of meat that I have ever had. The mix of flavors in the sauce were absolutely incredible too. The Steak was also very good but if I go back I am getting that lamb every time. It was the first time I ever had lamb too so if you are considering it, I encourage you. This was the first time I had Cheese Ice cream in the Philippines, I had no idea about it before coming here and it was really delicious with the bacon, I LOVED it! The Strawberry Icecream is a classic there too. Being Baguio the strawberries are the best in the world. I am a strawberry hater in the U.S. but they are so amazing in Baguio. The pricing is expensive for a dish in the Philippines but this place has food that rivals the best restaurants I've been to in America, including Gordon Ramsay restaurants. Taken that into account it's amazing value for money. This place is truly a Diamond in Baguio and I hope I can return someday. Thank You Po 🙏",

I let that slide coz what was served to us was all really amazing... but i hope that order placing process gets improved moving forward.\n\nHIGHLY RECOMMENDED 🥄🥄🥄🥄🥄\nAdding this as one of my Baguio Favorites to dine in... 🫰🫰🫰\n\nAnd WILL DEFINITELY BE COMING BACK to try their other dishes 😍😍😍",

Located just across from Wright Park, it's a picturesque spot with a rich history and charming colonial architecture.\n\nThe gate itself is the most photographed part - it's grand and well-maintained, and gives off a very regal vibe. Unfortunately, visitors aren't allowed to go inside the actual mansion unless there's a special tour or event, but the view from outside is still beautiful. There's a small museum near the gate that gives a bit of background on the property and its significance as the official summer residence of the Philippine President.\nMy favorite spot: the fountain",

I was absolutely amazed by the sight of all the vibrant houses painted in a beautiful mosaic of different colors. The entire hillside is a color frenzy that you won't get to see everyday. I loved the unique and eccentric architecture of the homes, which all came together to form one giant, living art installation. Seeing this for the first time is such a bizarre experience. It is just one jeepney away from Baguio City, as every jeep that will go to La Trinidad will surely pass this area. Another cool part of the experience was crossing the hanging bridge, which connects the colorful community to the main road. It's a great spot for taking photos and getting a wider view of the painted houses. It's important to remember that the Valley of Colors is a real, active community with people living there. It's not just a tourist attraction. We should always be mindful and respectful of the residents and their homes as we enjoy the view and take pictures. Don't leave any trash behind. The vibrant beauty of the place is made even better by the community that calls it home.",

            "text": "THIS PLACE NEEDS MORE RECOGNITION!!!\nSuch a hidden gem amongst the overly touristy places nearby.\n\nThis is a must-visit!! Such an impressive collection of everything Volkswagen!\n\nThere are 2 ways to reach the actual museum, one is thru a number of flights of stairs....and another easier route down the road, sa may kanto ng waiting shed, may daanan dun ng sasakyan and will lead straight to Campfolkswagen. We wish we knew about the 2nd route..hahah not gonna lie, going down that flight of stairs was kind of scary, but it did give us amazing views!!\n\nUpon arriving, you'll be immediately greeted by a customized motorcycle with a VW beetle rear and engine! My BF who is a car/motorcycle enthusiast was amazed right away! It was a great start.\n\nGround Floor: CAFE\nWe were in awe when we saw the view! It was so mesmerizing. It was really nice just sitting there in silence for a few good minutes and taking it all in. Watching the clouds roll on to the houses on top of the mountain.\n\nWe ate at the cafe first. The cafe area was also filled with VW and other vintage memorabilia! Even the plant pots were painted with VW designs. There were also musical instruments you can try, such as kalimba and a drum.\n\nFood was good naman! Not as bad as other reviews here say. It was simple, but straightforward, in terms of taste. No frills.\n\nLower Ground: MUSEUM & SHOP\nThere was a city-wide blackout during our visit, so we didn't get pictures of the Museum part. But we still enjoyed it nonetheless. The displays were so interesting we really brought out our flashlights just to read and look at the displays.\n\nWas really really amazed at the concept of the timeline display, wherein key moments in PH history was enumerated alongside which VW model was popular at that time! It was amusing and at the same time, educational. I also like how each display was meticulously done, especially that Yolanda display, where the VW diecast display was made to look exactly like the picture.\n\nI think if it's possible to collect everything about Volkswagen, the owner has probably done it here.\n\nLowest Floor: GALLERY\nAside from being a collector, we learned here that the owner is also an artist! In the Gallery, were artworks, still all VW-themed. And there was also a workshop there. Super cool.\n\nWe also got to talk to Sir Roland,the owner, collector and artist of the place. And we learned a lot about his interesting life and career. He is also a curator, has a background in architecture, also loves music, and is over-all a really cool guy.\n\nReally enjoyed our experience here, and I hope this place gets the recognition it deserves. Must be another Baguio destination staple!\nItuhog nyo na pag pupunta kayo sa Igorot Stone Kingdom at sa Tam-awan Village! Pero kahit sadyain nyo lang sya ng mag-isa, worth it parin. Pramis!",

It is a symbolic site for burying negativism-emotions, frustrations, attitudes, and thoughts that today we would call as \"bad vibes.\"\n\n“Negativism is man's greatest self imposed infliction, his most limiting factor, his heaviest burden,” a marker by the entrance eloquently explains. “No more for here is buried the world's negativism for all time. Those who rest here have died not in vain – but for you a stern reminder. As you leave this hill remember that the rest of your life. Be More Positive.” It sets the mood and manages the expectations for the visitors. (c)\n\n#jonahandpatrick #cemeteryofnegativism\n#campjohnhay #baguio #baguiocity",

Maybe it has already increased, I'm not sure how much is the entrance fee for kids.\n3. The words written in the tombstone are funny also the figure itself. If you circle around you might find your negative behaviour. Also, the pine trees added some good vibes.\n4. Not that crowded compared to other parks.\n5. There is an area for picnic, good for family visitors\n\nThis is a good experience as a first timer in Baguio.",
