It can get very crowded, but it's still a great spot overall. The main downside is the layout - the central section is taken up by private areas, leaving only the sides for public use. Also, the sunbed vendors are quite pushy and persistent - it feels like a scene from a movie! 🎬📽",

I started to queue for it at least 2 hours before so I was fairly near the start of the queue. It did fill up quickly so I would advise queueing up early to get a deck chair spot but you could just fully bring a beach towel and sit outside the cordoned area to watch without queueing. They did provide blankets as it does get chilly, but I'd still advise bringing a light jacket if you plan to stay long.",

The menu isn't vast, as you'd expect from more exclusive venues, but it's well curated and focused on quality. We ordered the pesto pasta and half chicken for mains, both beautifully prepared, before sharing a dessert right by the sea.\n\nService was attentive without being intrusive. I was unsure what to drink, and after a quick chat with our server about my preferences, I was recommended a glass of champagne, which turned out to be the perfect choice. Their suggestions were spot on throughout.\n\nIf you want to stay and enjoy the beach loungers but aren't a hotel guest, there is a surcharge per sunbed, around €30 each from memory, so worth bearing in mind if you're planning to spend the afternoon. That said, it's an ideal place to relax for a special treat or beachside lunch. Highly recommended booking in advance, as you'd expect it gets very busy as priority is given to hotel guests.\n\nThe overall bill came to around €100–€150 for two people, including two mains, one dessert to share, and drinks. For the location, quality, and service, we found it to be very fair value and would definitely return.",
