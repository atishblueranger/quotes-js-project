But the views along the walk are stunning and the beach is well worth the effort. It's a popular beach, but if the main beach is too busy you can scramble along the rocks to find your own quieter spot. Swimming is lovely and you can dry off in the sun after. The circular walk around to the next Calanques is definitely recommended for the views, but there is a bit of clambering involved.",

Accessible by a flight of stairs and sheltered from the wind, this is a charming but small beach that gets crowded in summer. Overlooked by the famous yellow house (every local you’ll meet has an opinion on its potential owners), this cove attracts both old and young fans of cool water swimming – the beach is in the shade in the afternoon.",

However, almost nil vegetation means no shade of trees. Be ready with your sun screen at least spf60 or more.\n\nThere are changing cabins, toilets (open until 18h45) and beach showers available on the beach.
