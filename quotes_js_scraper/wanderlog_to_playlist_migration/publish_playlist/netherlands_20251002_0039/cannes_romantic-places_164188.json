The menu isn't vast, as you'd expect from more exclusive venues, but it's well curated and focused on quality. We ordered the pesto pasta and half chicken for mains, both beautifully prepared, before sharing a dessert right by the sea.\n\nService was attentive without being intrusive. I was unsure what to drink, and after a quick chat with our server about my preferences, I was recommended a glass of champagne, which turned out to be the perfect choice. Their suggestions were spot on throughout.\n\nIf you want to stay and enjoy the beach loungers but aren't a hotel guest, there is a surcharge per sunbed, around €30 each from memory, so worth bearing in mind if you're planning to spend the afternoon. That said, it's an ideal place to relax for a special treat or beachside lunch. Highly recommended booking in advance, as you'd expect it gets very busy as priority is given to hotel guests.\n\nThe overall bill came to around €100–€150 for two people, including two mains, one dessert to share, and drinks. For the location, quality, and service, we found it to be very fair value and would definitely return.",
