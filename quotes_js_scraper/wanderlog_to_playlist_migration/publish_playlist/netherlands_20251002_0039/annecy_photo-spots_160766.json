            "text": "The Palais de l'Île is a stunning piece of medieval architecture and an iconic landmark nestled in the heart of Annecy's old town. Set dramatically in the middle of the canal, it's incredibly picturesque-perfect for photos, especially from the nearby bridges. Walking by it feels like stepping into a storybook.\n\nThe museum inside offers a good glimpse into Annecy's history, including the building's use as a prison and administrative center. The rooms are small but atmospheric, with just enough information to keep it interesting without being overwhelming. Exhibits include historical artifacts and some temporary displays that are a nice surprise.\n\nThat said, it's a relatively quick visit-about 30 to 45 minutes tops-so manage expectations if you're looking for a full-scale museum experience. Some areas could use more detailed explanations or interactive features. Still, the value is fair for the entry price, and it's worth a stop, especially if you enjoy architecture or local history.\n\nTip: try to go early in the day or during off-hours to avoid the crowds, and combine your visit with a stroll around the charming old town.",

We spent about an hour there which was more than enough. Takes about 10mins to walk there from the base of the hill on old town.",
