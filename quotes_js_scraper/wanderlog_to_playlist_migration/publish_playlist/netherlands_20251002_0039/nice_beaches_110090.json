The food was even better.  We were nearing the end of two week vacation mostly in Italy where the food was fantastic.  This was our best dinner of the whole trip.  The fish just melted in my mouth and my wife thoroughly enjoyed her beef.  We unfortunately didn't take our waiters advice to preorder the cherry dessert but the other two options made up for any disappointment.  Can't recommend La Réserve any higher.",

Fast service with very nice people. I am afraid they have the worst food, never fresh or delicious, I guess due to being busy all the time. They cover a very large area, I don't think any other beach clubs have the same capacity like this one. 35 euros per person without towels that includes umbrella and sun bed. Their sun beds are so close to each other and not possible to move them. The best part of the beach area is they have sun beds with full shade at the back if you prefer. We have reserved online but they don't check for reservation. If you come early and go in the queue, you can always have a place.",

Only positive thing it's situated on beautiful coast.\n\nI was really looking forward to celebrating my birthday at this restaurant, given its stunning coastal location. While the view was lovely, unfortunately, that was the only highlight of the evening.\n\nThe fish and vegetables were a huge disappointment, especially the vegetables, which had an odd, bitter taste. The fish itself felt hastily prepared, and the cheesecake was equally underwhelming, with strange flavors that didn't blend well. The entire meal was a letdown, with the only decent part being the mojito I had.\n\nTo make matters worse, I spent nearly 100 euros on this meal, and for that price, I expected much more care and quality. The service was extremely poor. I had to constantly ask the server for basic things like water, which felt ridiculous. Despite being alone at my table, I was practically ignored, having to flag the server down multiple times just to get attention. It felt like they didn't care about me as a customer.\n\nOn top of that, I saw the chef walking around chatting with a large table, while my meal seemed hastily thrown together without care or attention to detail.

The staff was very helpful. They do charge extra if you want to rent towels in addition to the daybeds, or you can bring your own towels.\n\nAs for lunch, the server was very friendly and helpful. Similar chill, classy, beach vibes at lunch. Reservation is recommended if you're trying to go during the height of the lunch hour. The Caesar salad was awesome and came with chicken. The tuna was good too, but the Caesar was better. The table over got the pizza which looked really good too.",

Nice assortment of cocktails too.\nOut Niçoise salad was huge, with big chunks of tuna throughout, and my tuna sushi rolls - while pretty small -  were delicious.

            "text": "Came here for dinner recently as a celebration and was, in all honesty, a little let down. Going into this place we had seen the menu so we were aware of the upmarket prices and so I would say had expectations in line with this.\nMost prices were around the €30 mark (starters and a few main options) but these do go up to towards €100 for other dishes and specials. I have read a lot of complaints about these prices but if that's what they want to charge and they think the ingredients are worth; it is displayed before you take a seat and is somewhat expected due to location. Saying this €8 for a soft drink is DOUBLE what we have found most places chrage for the same drink. I wouldn't say the food is bad by any means and I did quite enjoy the very cheesy margarita pizza (one of the 2 vegetarian dishes and probably the cheapest main meal option).\nMy problem however is more within the details you would expect from an up market place like this one. To start the server seemed a little dismissive especially when not ever member of the table wanted to order a drink from the menu. We felt as if there was a contrast between the service offered to our table and that to those of who we presumed to be locals. This became apparent as our server asked the table next to us if their food was okay but not ours. I suppose this could be simply due to a language barrier or if it was something to do with the \"type\" of people they assumed us to be.\n\nOther small details I think this restaurant could work on include serving the bread with butter or oil (and at a minimum providing a small plate so we didn't cover the table in crumbs before the mains). As well as potentially revising the menu slightly as I felt the vegetation options were very minimal and boring.\n\nIn summary; I felt as if this place charge more money than the overall experience is worth. I believe if they revisited small aspects (specially relating to service) it would make the prices feel much more reasonable. The venue and the food are not necessarily lacking but I am confident to say that you would be able to find similar quality food with much better service at a fraction of the price at any other restaurant that is not located right on the beach.\n\np.s As has already been mentioned this does not feel like the type of place it would be acceptable to share dishes or drinks between guests. There is definitely a sense of pressure to spend a large amount of money per person.",

We were informed only the double beds at the back were available for £170 for half the day which we reluctantly agreed to. We then witnessed multiple people be offered the single sunbeds at £55 throughout the afternoon we appeared to not have booked either. There appeared to only be 3 staff members working the beach and the service became the real disappointment of the day. We spent an hour trying to flag down a staff member to order drinks and some food. Eventually we ordered and went for a swim. When we came back our drinks still had not arrived and we were told we hadn't ordered with the specific staff member that holds the only device you can order from. After ordering again, the food and drinks arrived quickly and were okay - nothing amazing for the price. It then took another hour to flag him down for a second drink. The location is 10/10, the most gorgeous clear water we have swam in and beautiful views. However the service, price and overall attitude of the staff really let it down. We paid considerably less at a different beach club for more food, drink and quality service.",

We stayed at the club from about 12pm-6pm and did not want to leave. We had front row chairs, so it felt like we had the whole beach to ourselves. The chairs were very comfortable. The bathrooms were clean, though you do have to pay $10 extra for towels to shower afterward if you are not staying at the hotel. That would be my only complaint, otherwise, everything was amazing. Highly recommend and make your reservation early on mysunbed.com!",

It was a little hard to flag their staffs down since there were so many people but the staffs are friendly overall.\n\nIt was a nice way to spend a day relaxing at the beach. We wish that they would open a little longer since the sun sets so late anyways but they already start packing up around 6:30pm.\n\nThe bed and umbrella was indeed iconic for a Nice beach. Very beautiful and chic. I wish we have a little bit more space in between. It felt a little cramped with everyone an inch away from each other.",

We did arrive at 9:45am and checked in at 10am. The beach club was almost empty up until about noon so I'm not sure if the reservation was necessary. It cost about $98 for two beds, an umbrella, two towels, and two spots in front. Obviously it is a tourist spot and so they are going to charge the tourist rate. The locals just seem to bring their own mats and umbrellas. The kitchen opens at noon and although the menu says there's lunch special combo/rate, our server said that it wasn't available even though it was a Tuesday. The food was okay. Definitely bring water shoes if you decide to visit any of the beaches along the promenade.",
