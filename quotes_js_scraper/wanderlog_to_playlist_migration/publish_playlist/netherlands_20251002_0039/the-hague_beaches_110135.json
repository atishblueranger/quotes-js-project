It offered a unique and refreshing experience that exceeded my expectations in many ways.\n\nThe spaciousness of this beach, combined with low crowd density, creates an atmosphere of pure serenity. If you're seeking peace and tranquility, you'll find it here.\n\nOne standout feature of Strand Kijkduin is the abundance of restaurants and bars that line the shore. Whether you're craving Dutch delights or international cuisine, there's something to please every palate. The quality of the food is impressive, and dining with a view of the sea is an unforgettable experience.\n\nI must admit that, as a Mediterranean person, I had different expectations for the sea. While it might not have the vibrant blue waters I'm used to, it still provides a pleasant and refreshing dip on a warm day.\n\nThe availability of a nearby supermarket is a huge convenience. It's perfect for stocking up on essentials and snacks without the need to venture far from the beach.\n\nNow, let's talk about those sunbeds and umbrellas. While they do come with a price tag (10 euros for sunbeds and 7 euros for umbrellas), the comfort and shade they offer are well worth it. It's a small indulgence that enhances the overall beach experience.\n\nOne small caveat is the parking situation. While there is a free car parking spot nearby, finding an empty space can be a bit of a challenge. Be prepared for a hunt or consider alternative transportation options.\n\nIn conclusion, Strand Kijkduin is a hidden gem that I highly recommend. It offers tranquility, fantastic dining options, and the convenience of a nearby supermarket. Despite my initial reservations about the sea, the overall experience deserves a solid five out of five stars. It's a beach that has something for everyone to enjoy!",
