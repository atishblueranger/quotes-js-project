The rooms are spacious and clean and the staff is very nice, friendly and accommodating.\n\nThe services that we were especially impressed with were (1) they partner with a local ski shop that delivers rentals directly to and picks up the hotel. The hotel has a separate locker room to store the equipment, and they shuttle you to the lift of your choice when ready to ski! (2) I left my Kindle in the room and they shipped it back to New York City for us free of charge. It was so kind and generous!\n\nI highly recommend and will definitely stay here again.",

My friend had the slow-cooked egg for his starter and the riz au lait for dessert and could not stop raving about both either. I also loved the carrot cream brought out as appetizer. Cocktails were fantastic as well and the wine selection was extensive and lovely. Service was top notch as well. Finished the delicious meal with their wonderful limoncello served chilled. My only suggestion would be to bring out some whipped butter with the fantastic bread. Absolutely beautiful meal and experience. Highly recommend!",

While the staff were attentive, we felt rushed from the moment we sat down. The server came multiple times within just a few minutes of being seated to check if we were ready to order, which felt quite pressuring. The pacing of the meal felt off. We were finished and out of the restaurant in an hour. When the dessert menu was presented, the server returned just two minutes later asking if we'd decided, even though we hadn't yet opened the menu.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend this place.

You won't be presented with a menu, but three alternatives on the number of tasting dishes.  The attentive, friendly staff will then ask of you have any allergies or food dislikes so the chef knows what not to prepare for you.  Then sit back,  enjoy the wine and wait to be surprised and delighted with each dish presented to you with an explanation by the smiling server.  This is a MUST place for food lovers (NOT FOR FUSSY EATERS) and it's just delightful not having to choose from a menu but instead be served delicious local seasonal food.  Each dish is presented as a work of art and a taste sensation!   Some may say the the price is expensive, BUT just look at the care and skill involved - that doesn't come cheap so just suck up the cost and know it will be an experience that lives on for a long time!  The setting is beautiful - as this was the summer we ate outside with views of the mountains in a tranquil, fairy light lit garden.  A memorable experience overall!",

This is my honest review of the restaurant La Cabane des Praz in Chamonix ski resort, France.\n\nA magical atmosphere in a cozy wooden cabin surrounded by snow, enhanced by charming Christmas decorations. The service was friendly, attentive, and accommodating, even lending me a snow brush for my car. The food was delightful: the scallop tartare was beautifully presented and flavorful, the poultry with creamy morel mushroom sauce was tasty (though the skin could have been crispier), and the apple crumble dessert was fresh and delicious. A wonderful experience overall-highly recommended! (I didn't pay, so I can't comment on the pricing.)",
