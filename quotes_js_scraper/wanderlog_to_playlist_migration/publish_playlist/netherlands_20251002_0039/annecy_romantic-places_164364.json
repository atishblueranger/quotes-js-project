Set dramatically in the middle of the canal, it's incredibly picturesque-perfect for photos, especially from the nearby bridges. Walking by it feels like stepping into a storybook.\n\nThe museum inside offers a good glimpse into Annecy's history, including the building's use as a prison and administrative center. The rooms are small but atmospheric, with just enough information to keep it interesting without being overwhelming. Exhibits include historical artifacts and some temporary displays that are a nice surprise.\n\nThat said, it's a relatively quick visit-about 30 to 45 minutes tops-so manage expectations if you're looking for a full-scale museum experience. Some areas could use more detailed explanations or interactive features. Still, the value is fair for the entry price, and it's worth a stop, especially if you enjoy architecture or local history.\n\nTip: try to go early in the day or during off-hours to avoid the crowds, and combine your visit with a stroll around the charming old town.",

They had some good signature cocktails (although 2 were unavailable). The heirloom tomato appetizer was delicious and the main dishes were tasty, but what really impressed us was the desserts. Not your typical French selection.  Our favorite was the pistache attack which was a homemade pistachio ice cream bar with raspberry syrup and raspberries on top.  WOW  The apricot rosemary and white peach jasmine sorbets were also fantastic.  I really loved the creativity in these desserts!  We also ordered two other desserts that were also very good. Overall the service was very good, however I am giving only 4 stars for it because it was a little tough to get our server's attention for things like more water, dessert menu, and the receipt to pay (which is actually done at the front we were told). We also never received one of the meals we ordered.  When we realized it had been forgotten my son said it was fine so we didn't say anything but it was on the receipt when we paid so they just took it off.",

Lots of interesting art, both old and new (ish). It's a pretty cheap place to visit and you can go when it suits, no need to book ahead of time. We spent about an hour there which was more than enough. Takes about 10mins to walk there from the base of the hill on old town.",

The glasses were not clean, and when we raised the issue, the waitress claimed it was caused by “friction between the glasses” and said they “work very hard”. But one of the glasses we were given had visible smudges, which is unacceptable in any dining environment. During our meal, the same waitress bumped into one of us quite forcefully while walking past and didn't acknowledge it or apologize. That kind of inattentiveness and lack of courtesy left a very poor impression. The service felt disorganized, and the staff didn't seem equipped to manage the number of customers. Lastly, the fondue was overly salty and lacked variety. Considering the price, both the food and the service were disappointing. I wouldn't return or recommend this place based on our visit.",

The staff was friendly and tried their best to attend to us as soon as they could, since it was a busy night.\n\nThere are three seating areas, it was cold when we went so we sat indoors upstairs, which was perfect.",
