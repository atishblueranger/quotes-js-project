While opinions vary-some adore them, others find them unattractive-no one remains indifferent to their presence. These seven resin statues, located in the heart of Nice at Massena Square, were crafted by Jaume Plensa, a Spanish artist renowned for his monumental works.\n\nThe statues symbolize the seven continents and the interconnectedness of diverse communities in modern society. Titled *Conversation à Nice*, the installation embodies the idea of global dialogue. Each night, the statues are illuminated, with colors shifting gently to evoke a sense of communication and exchange between them. The effect is both visually stunning and deeply poetic.",

There are some amazing views and photo opportunities and the whole area has a lovely vibe, tourists and locals mixing together.\n\nWe walked up there from our hotel, The Palais Ségurane boutique hotel on Rue Catherine Ségurane. It started off with a gentle ramp and there various sets of steps from time to time but if you're relatively fit you'll mange it without too much problem.\n\nWe just explored the routes, essentially if you keep heading upwards you won't go far wrong. Once at the top there are several different areas, some open spaces, a couple of food stalls, a toilet (0.5 Euros), some amazing vantage points, a performance area and of course the famous waterfall.\n\nThe views out over Nice are quite astounding and it's easy to lose yourself watching the world go by in miniature beneath you. We also tried to work out where we'd been in the city.\n\nWe didn't try to use the elevator which I imagine can get busy. The walks up and down tend to spread people out and there are little diversions and resting areas.\n\nGiven the proximity to the old town it's easy to make a full day of the area.",

The kids loved the numerous fountains, then moved to the wooden gym-set and lots of other attractions, there are plenty of benches for adults and you may simply rest on the soft grass. There is a lot of greenery , beautiful birds. On the downside, during the weekends the place gets very busy, even overcrowded, and some people smoke right on the grass next to the kids!!! Smoking at such a place must be prohibited!!! We also saw a huge rat passing by the bench;)",

Food very average, octopus salad didn't taste of anything it was literally rocket and octopus. Should be adults only as lots of loud children (got hit by a child flinging around his towel twice 😭). Also a lot of obnoxious American. Drinks good and a standard price. Overall not bad for the location, one of the more affordable options on nice beach and I would still come back.",
