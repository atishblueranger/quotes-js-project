Awe-inspiring structure is one of the most magnificent examples of Gothic architecture in Europe I guess.\n\nThe level of craftsmanship in every inch of the cathedral is truly unbelievable. Each carving, statue, and relief on its seems to carry deep meaning and historical richness. It's not just decorative-it tells stories. You can spend hours simply admiring the exterior, discovering new details every time you look up: scenes from the Bible, mythical creatures, saints, and symbolic motifs, all sculpted with stunning precision.\n\nStepping inside is just as moving. The vast interior, stained-glass windows is just amazing. You can differentiate based on the art the era it was completed in given it took 500 years on an average to complete it. One of the highlights is the astronomical clock.\n\nIf you're anywhere near Alsace, this cathedral is absolutely worth a detour. Magnificent is the only word that even comes close.",

The menu was well presented and had a variety of classic and modern French dishes. The wine menu was extensive and complimented the food well.\n\nThe dishes were beautifully presented and we enjoyed the frogs legs and the starters the most. The veal was slightly tough unfortunately. However the other dishes we tried were very well cooked and had great flavours.\n\nThe service wasn't very attentive, and we had extremely long periods between courses. Fortunately, we weren't time pressured, so this wasn't as much of an issue as it could have been.\n\nI would definitely like to revisit and see what other delicious dishes Buerehiesel have to offer.",

Also 10/10 for the soufflé dessert “soufflé chaud à la pêche blanche et sorbet au thym”. 7/10 for the mille-feuille au chocolat with sorbet chocolate. Lacks freshness. However 10/10 for the starters savory Kugelhopf and micro flammkuchen. So kind careful and attentive service. We were here for dinner. It was my first Michelin star restaurant in France. So nice atmosphere outdoor on an evening of 32 degree summer day surrounded by the nice typical Alsatian architecture and the green all around.  The Buerehiesel is an Alsatian house dating from 1607. Around 10 tables of 3 and 5 outdoor under lovely sunshades. Very romantic atmosphere. For the record, the building was brought piece by piece to the park on the occasion of the International Industrial Exhibition of 1895. Her vegetable garden and gazebo came with her. This year marks the year when Strasbourg hosted the international event in the Orangerie Park.\n\nPity it was too gloomy at the tables on the terrace. If you want to see what is on your plate and the nice colors of the dishes and the desserts prefer to book a table inside. Lovely and luminous inside.",

That really helped us enjoy the madeleines on a different level, not only were the madeleines so beautiful, the stories brought us to the next level of enjoyment when we savoured the madeleines.  Our favourites was Coeur de Givre, Jardin à Marrakech, Magie Praliné, and Victoria.\n\nThe owner also recommended some tea for us, they are very reasonably priced.  We have not tried yet but are looking forward to taste them soon.",

On their online platforms it looked very good but when we tried it, the burger was overcooked, and the bread was very thick and dry making the burger in general very dry. The flavour of the meat however was very good and the salad you got on the side was delicious! The staff was very friendly. Don't really think it was worth 22 CHF.",

            "text": "Found this gem for good Italian food by chance. It's located near the Catheral. We had the lunch special Osso Corso Risotto which came with a plate of smoked salmon\nSalad. The portion was generous for the amount we paid. The smoked salmon\nSalad was extremely tasty and we love the freshly baked artisanal baguette. Requested for extra serving of the baguette which they generously obliged.\n\nThe risotto was creamy and cooked to perfection. Can't ask for more. We totally enjoyed the dish. The cream brûlée was a little sweet for us, custard texture  was just nice\n\nLike the creative decor of the place. And the server was friendly and helpful in explaining what constitutes the special lunch meal. It's a place to go to for Italian food",
