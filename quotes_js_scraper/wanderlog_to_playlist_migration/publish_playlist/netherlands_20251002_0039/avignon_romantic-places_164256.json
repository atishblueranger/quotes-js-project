The duck main course is superb-one of the best duck dishes I've ever had. The beef carpaccio with honey sauce is creative; the sweetness of the honey somehow works perfectly well with the thinly sliced high-quality beef, paired with fresh carrots and bell peppers for a crunchy herbal garnish.\nThe hostess is an elegant British woman, whose French husband is the highly skilled chef behind the scene. The husband-wife team clearly poured a lot of love into the food they serve at this cozy homey restaurant. The atmosphere is very intimate. The restaurant is small so I highly recommend you book ahead of time. During the theater festival they're often times booked out many days in advance, but if you're lucky enough you might get a table because someone else canceled last minute. Anyway, I highly recommend booking in advance!",

The rooms are a bit old and tired and nothing in them screams “5 star”. We were fresh off a stay at another SLH hotel location in Barcelona which was fantastic and truly a 5 star experience with friendly and helpful staff and great rooms. This location is like a €100 hotels.com pick. The “complimentary water” was a cheap plastic bottle and the in room coffee wouldn't even be fitting for a Best Western. At breakfast, we had a juice spill on the table. Not one staff member offered to help, or even a napkin. They're completely disengaged. Additionally, the location isn't convenient to anything and the outside of the building, and neighborhood, were not exactly impressive. The cherry on top was them trying to charge me for an extra breakfast for my 2 year old who ate a croissant. This property is not deserving to be within the SLH property group with Hilton and is a poor representation of the Hilton brand.",

The rooms were very nice, standard size for what I would expect in Europe. The shower and bath were nice and we used both. It was cold so we didn't use the outdoor pool, but the indoor pool, hot tub and spa were nice. Breakfast was a disappointment after our stay at a different SLH location in Narbonne but was acceptable.\nThe negatives are room layout vs office location and how to get to the breakfast area. We initially kind of got lost trying to find the breakfast area the first day. The paths are not flat, they are natural rock paths which made rolling luggage difficult. Only one restaurant and it's very expensive. The location itself is fine and felt safe, but it is not a hotel to book if you want to Uber from the airport and plan to walk everywhere. We read this on other reviews and we had a rental car because our main plan was visiting tasting rooms in Gigondas and Chateauneuf de Pape so it didn't cause us any issues.",

When the Papacy relocated to Avignon in the 14th century, the cathedral became the site of major papal liturgical ceremonies and masses. Its proximity to the Palais des Papes elevated its religious and symbolic status significantly. The building has undergone several restorations, especially in the late 19th century, which preserved its original Romanesque structure while incorporating Gothic and Baroque elements. One of its most striking features is the gilded statue of the Virgin Mary atop the western façade, visible from many parts of the city. Inside, the cathedral houses the marble tomb of Pope John XXII, making it not only a religious but also a historical monument closely tied to Avignon's unique role in Church history.",

You get a 5 course set menu at lunch and a 7 course set menu at dinner which is what we had. The setting is formal and the sever was very pleasant and very knowledgeable about the food. Would highly recommend.",

Unlike other tasting menu experiences I've had in the past, Hièly is perfectly portioned and paced. It's a MUST do in Avignon. Ideally, book ahead of time on the website but we were lucky enough to walk-in during low tourist season. There are only 3 or 4 tables so book far in advance if you can. Worth every euro and more.",

You'll need to walk up the 124 step narrow stone spiral staircase with views out the narrow slit windows as you go. There are 3 levels - first level up there is a large room with several audiovisual booths - you can sit on a stone seat to listen in French or English. It was quite peaceful and cool there, hearing about history and construction. And one could look out the windows too.\nLevel 2 was another large room with what looked like some stone walls with original painted designs. I didn't spend long here. Up further to the roof, one passes through an old hinged wooden door (keep it closed to stop pigeons coming in!). The top has parapets and another round tower which is inaccessible. The views are 360° - beautiful! Of the rooftops of Villeneuve-les-Avignon, the Rhône river, Palais des Papes and Pont d'Avignon. Being mid-afternoon the light was gorgeous - reflecting off the dark grey clouds and silvery Rhône of the west. You can observe life happening below on and off the river. I think the ambience of the place was heightened by being there totally alone - and thinking of what had taken place in this area over the centuries. Well worth the climb and entry fee!!",

            "text": "Disappointing Experience Despite a Charming Setting\n\nWe stayed at Hotel Europe in Avignon for one night, from April 30th to May 1st. The hotel itself has undeniable charm-an elegant, old-style luxury with a lot of character. Our room was particularly spacious and included a cute little balcony. The location is also excellent: perfectly situated to explore Avignon on foot.\n\nHowever, our overall experience was unfortunately marred by a serious lack of consideration for guests' comfort. We paid around €460 for the night, expecting a restful and high-end stay. Instead, on the morning of May 1st- a public holiday-we were woken up at 9 a.m. (possibly even earlier) by what can only be described as construction-site noise: loud banging, metal being cut, and heavy machinery sounds. When I opened the window, I could see that the noise was coming from some sort of renovation or construction work within the hotel itself.\n\nWe eventually got up and decided to check out earlier than planned. During check-out, the receptionist politely asked how our stay had been, and I responded honestly, expressing that it was unacceptable to disturb guests with such intense noise at that hour, especially on a holiday morning. Her response was quite dismissive-she mentioned they were “installing mirrors or something like that”-and proceeded to charge me an additional €26.60 for the use of the parking without acknowledging the inconvenience we experienced.\n\nLet me be clear: this complaint is not about the money. It's about manners and respect for the guest. When a customer points out that their sleep was disturbed by noise caused by the hotel itself, and particularly when that customer is staying at a so-called 5-star property and paying close to €500 per night, the very least you would expect is a gesture of goodwill. Waiving the parking fee or offering a token of apology would have been appropriate and professional.\n\nWe chose this hotel hoping for a restful and luxurious experience. Instead, I left feeling disappointed and unrested. It's a pity because the hotel really does have potential. But service matters just as much as style-and this was not the service one should expect from a 5-star establishment.",

When we arrived they spent time with us to review a map of the city and make recommendations of where to go and what to do. They made dinner reservations for us at delicious restaurants!  The room was clean and functional. This is a 500 year old building with tons of character. The rooms have air conditioning and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent! There is no elevator  but Fabrice carried our bags to our room. We highly recommend this great place!",
