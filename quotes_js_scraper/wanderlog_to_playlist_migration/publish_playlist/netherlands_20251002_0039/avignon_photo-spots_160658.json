            "text": "The Bridge in the Nowhere - because, well, it's not exactly taking you anywhere anymore! But that's part of the charm of the Pont Saint-Bénézet, a historic bridge in Avignon that stands proudly as a symbol of the city, even though it no longer spans the Rhône River entirely.\n\nFun Facts:\n•\tThe bridge originally had 22 arches, but now only four remain. The missing arches were destroyed over time due to floods and natural wear.\n•\tSaint Bénézet, after whom the bridge is named, was a shepherd who, according to legend, was told by God to build the bridge. He supposedly carried a large stone across the river by himself to prove his divine mission.\n•\tThe bridge is also famously featured in the popular French song “Sur le Pont d'Avignon,” which has made it internationally recognizable.\n\nThis beautiful structure is a marvelous sight, offering a peaceful stroll across the remaining arches. The view of the Rhône River and the surrounding city is stunning, and the serene walk gives you a sense of stepping back in time. You can almost imagine how it must have felt centuries ago when the bridge was a vital crossing point connecting the north and south of the river.\n\nAs for the history, the Pont Saint-Bénézet dates back to the 12th century and was a critical part of medieval trade routes. Over time, however, it fell victim to both natural disasters and warfare, leaving only a few of its arches still standing. Despite the passage of time, the bridge remains a powerful reminder of the city's medieval significance and the ingenuity of its builders.\n\nAdmission is €5 for adults, and it's free for those under 18. For visitors over 64, there is a discounted rate - €4.",

When the Papacy relocated to Avignon in the 14th century, the cathedral became the site of major papal liturgical ceremonies and masses. Its proximity to the Palais des Papes elevated its religious and symbolic status significantly. The building has undergone several restorations, especially in the late 19th century, which preserved its original Romanesque structure while incorporating Gothic and Baroque elements. One of its most striking features is the gilded statue of the Virgin Mary atop the western façade, visible from many parts of the city. Inside, the cathedral houses the marble tomb of Pope John XXII, making it not only a religious but also a historical monument closely tied to Avignon's unique role in Church history.",
