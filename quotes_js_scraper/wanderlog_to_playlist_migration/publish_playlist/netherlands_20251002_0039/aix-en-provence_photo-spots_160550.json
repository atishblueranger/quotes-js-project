Really enjoyed and felt privileged to see that, but unfortunately maintenance of the building inside and outside really left us a bit sad and disappointed. Everything felt outdated and abandoned 20 years ago. Outside is not that bad really but inside… pictures speaks for itself. And on top of that entrance is not cheap at all I think 16 eur regular and 12 for students, which I'm happy to pay but also expect to be cleaned well preserved and not only that but taken care of with love, which here doesn't feel at all. Anyways I would still recommend for others to visit and hopefully whoever is in charge should start taking his job seriously and fix this foundation like it deserves it.",
