What makes it really special is that the building itself used to be a huge train station, it was the Gare d'Orsay, built around the early 1900s. Instead of tearing it down, they turned it into a museum, which means you get this amazing mix of old industrial architecture and art all in one place.\n\nInside, the museum is packed with incredible artworks, mostly from the late 19th and early 20th centuries. You'll find tons of famous Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings here, artists like Monet, Degas, Renoir, Van Gogh, and Cézanne. If you love those bright, colorful paintings or want to get a feel for the art that changed the world, this is the spot.\n\nBesides paintings, the museum also has sculptures, decorative arts, and photography. It's pretty manageable in size, so you don't get overwhelmed like in some bigger museums.\n\nThe museum sits right on the left bank of the Seine, close to the Louvre and the charming Saint-Germain area. So, it's easy to fit it into a day of exploring Paris.\n\nIt's recommended to visit here. :)",

The Orsay Museum houses some of the world's most treasured art pieces.\n\nFrom Monet, Gauguin, Manet, Renoior to Van Gogh and so many more.  Paintings and sculptures abound in the former train station.  A half-day should be the minimum amount of time spent in the great halls of the Orsay.  My last visit we elected to use a self-guided audio tour and enjoyed every step.\n\nThe Dance at the Moulin De La Galette by Renoir is my current favorite.  Degas' multi-texture sculpture Petite danseuse de quatorze ans is another favorite.\n\nThe Orsay is along the Seine near many other stops that I like to make when in the area.  Stroll along the river and take in the magazine stands and vendors.  Maybe a river tour starting from Pont Neuf.  With a little time left in your day the Luxembourg Gardens and the Shakespeare and Co Bookstore are easy additions to your afternoon trek.\n\nWhile I might prefer the Louvre or the Vatican overall as a museum...the Orsay has so many great works of art it should be included on your itinerary.  Definitely, something for everyone on this side of the Seine.",

There was a mass going on, but you were able to take a view around. We got to hear the organ. That was fascinating! Never heard before such beautiful tones, like an epic movie theme. I uploaded a video about it. The details of the facade is amazing too! The many details and of course the gargoyles! To sum it up, you must visit the cathedral when you are in Paris. The entrance is free, you just have to wait the line. Parisians don't wait, so don't be shy to stand in the line.",

Nestled right in front of the Eiffel Tower, this expansive public park offers one of the best open views of the tower, making it a perfect location for photography, picnics, or just relaxing and taking in the scenery.\n\nDuring the day, the park is filled with people lounging on the grass, families with children, and tourists snapping photos. It's a peaceful place to take a break from the city bustle. The lawns are well-maintained and spacious, allowing plenty of room to spread out, even when it's busy.\n\nIn the evening, the vibe shifts. As the Eiffel Tower begins to sparkle, the Champ de Mars transforms into a magical gathering place. People bring blankets, snacks, and even wine to enjoy the view. The sunset over the tower is a must-see and makes for incredible photos.\n\nThere are also street vendors around, offering snacks and souvenirs, and the whole area feels safe and welcoming. Plus, it's a great spot for a casual stroll, whether you're on your own, with friends, or as a couple.\n\nIf you're planning to visit the Eiffel Tower, make sure to spend some time in the Champ de Mars-it's the perfect place to enjoy the beauty of Paris at your own pace.",

It's a huge open park stretching out from the Eiffel Tower, and it's perfect for relaxing, having a picnic, or just sitting and watching the world go by. I came here in the late afternoon and stayed until the Eiffel Tower lights came on - the sparkle at night is honestly magical from here.\n\nIt can get crowded in some spots, especially closer to the tower, but there's plenty of space to spread out. Street vendors are everywhere (some can be pushy), but it's manageable. Overall, it's a great spot to unwind and enjoy one of the most iconic views in the world.",

Just steps from the Louvre, they offer a breath of calm and beauty that feels almost otherworldly compared to the lively streets just outside. It's the perfect place to slow down and really soak in the essence of the city. The carefully manicured tree-lined paths, sparkling fountains, and timeless sculptures create a dreamy blend of art and nature that captures the soul of Paris itself.\n\nWhat makes the Tuileries so special is their versatility. You can take a quiet morning stroll, sipping a coffee and watching the city slowly wake up, or spend the afternoon people-watching as Parisians and tourists alike fill the park. Children laugh as they sail toy boats in the fountains, couples linger on benches, and artists sketch in the shade. Every corner seems to tell its own little story.\n\nGolden hour is particularly enchanting, when the setting sun bathes the gardens in warm light, casting long shadows across the gravel walkways and making the statues glow. Whether you're walking through on your way to the Louvre or simply sitting still and letting time pass, the Tuileries never fail to offer peace, elegance, and that uniquely Parisian sense of timeless beauty. Truly, it's a must-visit.",

Just be mindful of your belongings, as with any tourist area.\n\nWhat makes this location even more special is that it's great both during the day and at night. Come in the late afternoon when the sun hits the tower from the square side - the golden light makes it look magical. And don't miss the nightly light show - it's simply unforgettable.

There are lots of people selling pictures too, we got some taken at night and were really pleased with them: don't just go with the first person who approaches you, shop around and look at their sample pictures and photo spots; prices are negotiable and aren't too bad to begin with €5-10 per photo.

The chapel's stunning stained glass windows are its main attraction, showcasing vibrant colors and intricate medieval designs that create a magical atmosphere inside. Even though it's a relatively small space, the history and artistry packed into it make it a must-visit for anyone interested in architecture or Parisian history.\n\nI'm using Paris Museum Pass, it allows me to skip the long ticket lines, however, even if you book in advance, you have to wait in the specific line assigned to your booked time, you can't enter directly. Also, early access is not possible, they follow your reservation time strictly. Remember to make a reservation online in advance. This helps secure entry at a preferred time and avoids the stress of waiting in crowds, which can get quite busy, especially during peak tourist seasons.\n\nThe chapel is located on Île de la Cité, near other famous landmarks like Notre-Dame, making it easy to include in a day of sightseeing. The visit doesn't take long, usually under an hour, but it leaves a lasting impression thanks to the breathtaking stained glass that tells stories from centuries ago.\n\nOverall, Sainte-Chapelle is a fantastic stop for travelers. I enjoyed a smooth and memorable experience exploring one of the city's most beautiful and historic sites.",

As a non Christian I do not know the meaning and value behind a lot of glass paintings there hence I took the audio guide. It has 8 or may be 12 recordings but they explain a lot of the history and symbolism very nicely. I thought it was a little expensive for the size compared to other places in Paris. I booked in advance and went there on Wednesday. They have lesser fee on Wednesdays.",

Compared to Pont Neuf, there were definitely more locks here, creating a unique atmosphere full of memories from couples around the world.\n\nMy wife and I didn't attach a physical lock, but we left our \"lock of the heart\" here-a promise that our love will last forever. It was a quiet but meaningful moment for both of us.\n\nIf you're visiting with someone special, I highly recommend walking across this bridge. The view over the Seine and the feeling of leaving a part of your love behind make it a truly memorable place.!",

I would recommend going in the early morning if you're into taking cinematic romantic pictures. If you want other pictures videos of this particular place, take a dinner cruise. If you've never done it before and you're at the stage of life where you really just want to enjoy scenic Paris. Take it at 8 pm. I really enjoy this bridge because walking to it and then to Napoleon's tomb is a wonderful walk and just nice.. It's a lot of history and quite frankly just beautiful. We also went this year on July 14 so we saw all of the military parade fanfare. Very interesting way to experience Paris.",

The gardens are peaceful and beautifully maintained, offering a picturesque escape from the bustling streets. The historic architecture and iconic black-and-white columns make it a perfect spot for photos and a quiet stroll. It's definitely worth a visit, especially if you're planning to go to the Louvre Museum-it's just next door! I would have given it five stars if there were a few more amenities like cafes or clearer signage, but overall, it's a lovely experience.",

It's full of history and truly one of the most remarkable cemeteries I've ever seen. Many celebrities and historical figures are buried here, and the atmosphere is surprisingly peaceful and serene.\n\nWhat struck me most was how clean and well-kept the whole place is. It's quiet-of course!-but in a really calming, respectful way. It's funny to think you're surrounded by the dead, yet it doesn't feel creepy at all. It's more reflective and beautiful than anything.\n\nI was also fascinated reading the headstones-some have birth dates but no death dates yet, which makes you pause and think. The architecture and tomb designs are absolutely stunning. You can spend hours just walking around and appreciating the history and artistry.\n\nTotally a worthwhile experience if you're in Paris. Highly recommend!",
