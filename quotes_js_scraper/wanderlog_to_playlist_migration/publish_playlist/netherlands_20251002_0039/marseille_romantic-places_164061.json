Currently undergoing some renovation work so the main tower is shrouded in scaffolding but that doesn't detract too much from the majesty of the place.  There's also amazing, 360 views of the sprawl of Marseille and the Med from here so 100% worth a visit.  Entry to the cathedral and grounds are free with only the museum being chargeable.",

From start to finish, the experience was immersive, thoughtful, and full of unexpected delights.\n\nThe wine pairing was exceptional, perfectly complementing each dish and elevating the flavors in ways I hadn't anticipated. A few dishes held an element of surprise-unique textures, bold flavors, and creative combinations that kept me engaged throughout the meal.\n\nWhile every course was beautifully executed, my personal favorite was the miso soup. It had incredible depth, rich umami, and a comforting yet refined balance that truly stood out.\n\nI am not a dessert person, so I wasn't a big fan of the dessert. I didn't finish cos I was too full by then.\n\nIf you appreciate innovative, sensory-driven dining, AM par Alexandre Mazzia is an absolute must-visit. The attention to detail, artistry, and seamless blend of flavors make for an unforgettable experience.",

They also served 3 types of bread, which was a bit much for me personally as matching 3 breads with 7 courses is too much.

The cuisine has deep Provençal roots with some clins d'œil to Armenia (the young Chef, Ludovic Turac, was born in Marseille but has an Armenian grandmother). It is full of the flavors from this cosmopolitan city and uses various spices from around the Mediterranean (every dish comes with a sampler of the spices used in its composition). The cooking is modern, but without the gimmicks that « modern cooking » sometimes entails. What is modern is the freshness of the ingredients (whose origins are always specified), the clarity of the preparation, the accuracy of the cooking, and the lightness of the dishes. We had the menu « essentiels », which feature two of the Provençal basics: aioli and bouillabesse. And they both taste like aioli and boyillabesse, but not in a traditional and roborative way. They are more like dreams or reminiscences of aioli and bouillabesse. The « cabillaud nacré » melts in the mouth and the aioli sauce, which is lightly emulsified, offers a pleasant accentuation that does not overpower the delicate taste of the fish. The « soup de roche » that accompanies the « rouget » of the bouillabesse, is strong and deep, as it suits to such kind of soup, but again, it does not take the main role. In both cases, there is a subtle balance between the various elements giving a feeling of plenitude but not of fullness. The meal unfolds, like a pleasant journey in the calanques, with its palette of colors and surprises. The cassis white wine was a perfect match to the rouget and the bouillabesse. The service is discreet and efficient. The tableware is original and well harmonized with the food. In short, a southern table, but rejuvenated and looking to the future. We will definitely come back.",

I must say this was the best Kimchi dish. The flavor was balanced and really tasty. It was out of the way how Asian use Kimchi in dishes. Really surprised. And the red mullet was cooked perfectly.\n\nFinally, the petit four cart was cute. You can choose anything you wanted.\n\nReasonable price, high quality cooking, beautiful sea view.",

The food was ok but definitely not worth a Michelin one-star status.\n\nThe protagonist of the menu is Bouillabaisse but by the forth dish, it gets a bit boring and uninspiring.\nThe Rock fish soup is too salty for our taste and we had to take it with bread to balance it out. The main course, different types of fish poached in soup, is no good; fish was overcooked and had no flavor that you would expect from fresh fish. The soup which the fish is soaked in too similar to the rock fish soup (or is the same?) they served in previous course. The soup's taste was strong and too salty that it overshadowed whatever little flavor that was in the fish. The two courses were basically the same, except for the fish added to it.\nThe dessert from the trolley are all no good either.\n\nThe staffs were standoffish and pretentious. They had a “get-down-to-business' attitude and had prioritized the food's presentation than caring about the customers. Despite the beautiful view, we did not find the atmosphere relaxing nor the lunch enjoyable.",

For only €2.50, we were treated to a beautiful and educational journey through the history and tradition of Marseille soap-making. The museum itself is charming, with informative displays that detail the process of creating the famous soap, as well as the significance it holds in local culture.\n\nOne of the highlights was learning about the traditional techniques and ingredients that make Marseille soap so unique. The exhibits were well-organized and easy to follow, providing a great mix of history, science, and local craftsmanship. It was fascinating to see how this centuries-old tradition continues to thrive today.\n\nAs a lovely bonus, each visitor is given a 100g bar of soap as a souvenir, which made the experience even more special. The soap smells amazing and is a wonderful reminder of our visit. It's a great touch that adds excellent value to the already affordable entry price.\n\nThe museum staff was also very welcoming and knowledgeable, which made our experience even more enjoyable. Overall, the Marseille Soap Museum is a must-visit for anyone interested in the city's rich heritage. A perfect blend of history and hands-on learning!",

The secret menu consisted of four exquisite seasonal dishes, of particular note the ricotta filled ravioli with morel mushrooms and green peas - it was springtime with every bite, followed by an excellent cheese plate and a divine dessert. The wine card is substantial and evenly priced. We sat at the bar which allows for unobstructed views of the goings on in the kitchen. The staff is warm and charming. Highly recommend La Mercerie. Thank you for a lovely evening.",

The waitstaff were so knowledgeable and helpful, we had some lovely conversations especially during the wine paring for each course.\n\nThere was a unique event where local winemakers were dining at the restaurant and we were able to see who made the wines we drank. One even came around pouring his wine and sharing stories with us all. Truly an amazing experience.\n\nWe sat at a table but saw the chef engaging with people sat at the bar and telling stories of the food to them so I would recommend that for sure!",
