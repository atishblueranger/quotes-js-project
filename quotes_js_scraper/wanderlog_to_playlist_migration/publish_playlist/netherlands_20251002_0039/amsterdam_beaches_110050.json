Making it a great spot for a picnic or a leisurely walk.\nYou can also rent/take a boat or go fishing on the lake.\n\nOne thing to note is that the water quality of the lake can sometimes be an issue, so it's important to check the current status before planning a swim. Additionally, during busy periods the lake can become quite crowded, which can detract from the peaceful ambiance.\n\nOverall, Gaasperplas is a great spot to unwind and enjoy the natural beauty of Amsterdam.",

Not too much danger for higher handicap players which is quite enjoyable.\nThe only thing was that we were not told that the greens were aerated, which was a bit of shame. They really rolled badly, on top of being already a bit damaged. Had we know, we would have probably played somewhere else.\n\nApart from that, everything was good and the people were lovely.\nI put 4 stars for the green conditions, but note that this is very positive and does not mean that it is not a good course.\n\nThanks for the time!",
