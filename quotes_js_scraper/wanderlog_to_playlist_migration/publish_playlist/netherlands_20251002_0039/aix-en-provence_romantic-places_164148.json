Had a good amount and was delicious, had a savory sauce.\nThe beef stew was good too, warm meal for a cold night, but had two pieces impossible to eat because  of the fat 😬\nThey offer nice complimentary bread with the meal.\nThe lava cake chocolate is a nice dessert to end the evening, not too sweet, made with bitter chocolate.\nThey have good wines too. The only problem in the menu, is very hard to read and understand what it's written",

Fresh ingredients are combined with innovation, but not over the top.  The sauces were superb. And every dish so pretty! All together a fantastic lunch.\n\nThe menu is set but we chose to add the scallops,  and we're glad we did, it was delicious. We started with an amuse bouche of lobster and radish that was wonderful, then 3 courses, followed by a light dessert. Every dish was a delight. The wine is interesting,  there is no menu, but a glass or bottle recommended by the waiter from a small but thoughtful cellar.  We were very pleased with the chablis region wine suggested for us.\n\nHighly recommended!",

From the moment we arrived, the atmosphere was welcoming and elegant, and the staff was incredibly attentive and professional throughout the entire evening.\n\nThe food was nothing short of extraordinary. We ordered the sea bass, the lamb, and the daily special, a perfectly cooked salmon and each dish was beautifully presented and full of rich, balanced flavors. The quality of the ingredients and the care put into the preparation were evident in every bite.\n\nWe also tried the dessert, which was equally impressive, refined, delicious, and the perfect way to end an exceptional meal.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a top-tier dining experience. We'll definitely be returning!",

The complimentary gazpacho was refreshing and delicious on a hot summer day, and I enjoyed it even as someone who is not a big fan of cold soups. The fish dish had typical Mediterranean flavors, whereas the beef dish was clearly influenced by Japanese cuisine, both very fresh and tasty. The side salad was great as well. Price is a bit higher compared to other restaurants nearby. Service was friendly but a bit slow as they get very busy in the evenings.",

The flavors are on point and the only thing that can be improved is increasing the number of wait staff during peak season as it was a challenge to get our orders in.\n\nThe place looks amazing. If you are sensitive to heat and there in Summer ask for a seat under the shade instead of the glass ceilings.",

Food was a 2 star because it has been reviewed really well but it actually was disappointing. Most of the food were overcomplicated and overpowered by unnecessary flavor. We got 3-4 starters, 4 mains. But only one of the mains was decent. The rest were very disappointing. To top this, I actually got a viral gastroenteritis and I think it was because of the tuna steak, which can only explain it was poorly prepared. Although on the night, I only fed back it was too salty, but I realize probably the salt covered the unwanted taste of not fresh fish. Service was decent. Atmosphere was okay, mostly because we've heard twice the kitchen disposing glasses or breaking bottles - unsure, but quite loud noises. For paying more than usual compared to the other restaurants in the area, it's not worth it.",

Amazing food, very different wines with each course, and despite being out by 9.30 for a second service we did not feel rushed at any stage. Definitely one to go to!",

From the bone marrow to the mains (paired with Domaine Overnoy's Savagnin 2022) to the French dessert cheese and Paris Brest (paired with the incredible Les Grains des Compains Jurancon 2022), the food was all beautifully done. Definitely reserve in advance as there are only two seatings per evening- probably the earlier one as we ran over as well. Don't miss this gem!",

Before the meal, he let us know what wines he had to pair with the dinner and he also has a very wide range of other wines you can choose from.\n\nThe dinner has two sections - one at 7:30 and another at 9:30. There are only about 20 seats so it's best to book ahead of time.\n\nOuf of the courses we ordered, we love the beef tongue main course the most - it's a creative way to pair the beef tongue with olive, mushroom and cucumber. They blended perfectly.\n\nThe owner, I think he's name is Frank, was super passionate about food and wine. We absolutely love his energy!",
