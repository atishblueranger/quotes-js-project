Cute coffee place at the entry, which was open despite the museum being shut.\n\nThe mixture of the autumn colour definitely made the experience even better.\n\nMake sure to exit through the bridge above the roundabout - I personally thought it was a cool experience to walk above a busy road full of cars on top of this cute bridge with plants with beautiful flowers on the each side of it 🙌🏼",

The interactive space museum offers an incredible variety of things to see and do, both indoors and outdoors. Our kids were thrilled to try out the simulators (with almost no waiting lines), where they felt like real space shuttle pilots, tractor drivers, and even captains of a fishing boat.\n\nOutside, you can walk among life-size spacecraft and even step inside some of them-something truly unique in Europe. One of the highlights was the panoramic theater, showing an engaging film about the galaxy and our solar system. It's just a pity that much of the content was only in French. For a museum that celebrates European cooperation in space, we had hoped for a bit more multilingual accessibility 😉.\n\nWe had a great time and, honestly, ran out of time after four hours of exploring. Whether it's sunny or rainy, this place is absolutely worth a visit!",

We are A1 level students at Language Onze School in Toulouse. As a beginner speaking French I was nervous but in a matter of minutes I felt at home.\n\nIt was very obvious why everyone who eats here has a reservation. The restaurant is small and cozy, well known by the locals, and the food was incredible. Just like all things French, they don't open until 8:00 p.m. and within 15 minutes if you don't have a reservation you won't be eating here.\n\nEverything we ate and shared was made with love and perfection.

Thankfully I booked it quite last minute as it was a last minute trip and I managed to get a table.\nThe location is on a quiet street near the university but I managed to find it.\nManaged to arrived a little early and was able to enter the restaurant to get to my seat. The staff there not many were able to speak English so there was one who could speak quite good English and he was the main server to my table for the night.\nSince I wanted to do a degustation menu for dinner, there were 2 types of menus available. I decided to go ahead with the surprise menu as I wanted to surprise myself and see what the chef would come up with.\nThroughout the meal, I didn't have the menu and only knew what was in the dish when it was served. Most of the dishes were seafood based which I liked, and some of the dishes were surprising as I have never tried the combination of ingredients before. It was quite refreshing and unique to me that these combination could complement so well and great job to the chef.\nA truly good meal and nothing to fault about, its 1 star Michelin and yet it doesn't burn a hole in the pocket.\nBefore I left at the door I actually met the chef and got a handshake. A nice way to end the meal and kudos to the entire team!",

I thought it was over rated being it's a celebrity chef owned restaurant but in fact, it's reasonably priced for lunch at 75€ for amuse bouche, aperitif, entree, plat, desserts, coffee and inclusive of wine pairing. Drinks are almost never inclusive of lunch menus in haute-cuisine establishments, so this was a good deal. Plates are elevated, even if they do the twist on your favorite bacon and eggs for brunch, as we came for lunch..It was still a pleasant foodie experience. The flavor construction of the dishes are excellent! The location is good, quiet street at the back of the university area and going to Compans-Cafarelli. The car parkings available right in front by the street. Decoration is tasteful and elegant but not stuffy and pretentious. Service is impeccable, servers are professional but not stuck-up or snobbish. The hostess/host were friendly and smiling. Even Michel Sarran himself came to visit every table and I complimented him on giving such a good dining experience. He was nice. Well deserved of a Michelin star.  I keep coming back!",

Originally built in the early Middle Ages, the basilica has undergone several transformations over the centuries, blending Romanesque and Gothic architectural elements. The interior is peaceful and elegantly decorated, making it a wonderful place for reflection and admiration. Its golden statue of the Virgin Mary is a notable highlight, symbolizing the deep spiritual heritage of the city. A must-visit for anyone interested in history and sacred architecture.",
