The room, location, and food were amazing, but what really stood out the most was the service. From the concierge staff, waitresses, maids, everyone was incredible. This was my first time in France (from USA), and my boyfriend explained that Hotel Martinez and the Carlton, were the top two in Cannes, with Carlton being #1. I can firmly say, our next trip to Cannes must be at Hotel Martinez, and we would not have had the top-notch experience if we were anywhere else, thanks to the staff.\n\nDelphine (if I'm spelling that correctly), made our trip especially magical. After over-hearing us denied from the restaurant because they were closing, she didn't skip a beat and directly guided us to this beautiful bar in the back. She had us seated where we pleased, and the bar was absolutely beautiful. Speakeasy feel, incredible mood lighting and curated art-deco furnishings. Delphine had us served quickly, and when that bar closed, made arrangements for an additional glass of wine - her wine recommendations were stellar. She introduced herself as the new manager of the bar, we thanked her for her exceptional service, and she beautifully described her love for hospitality, and her \"why\". In LA and Miami, especially at 5 star establishments, the staff often treat guests like they are a burden to even check in or ask for reservations. Not only did we receive exceptional service, but I felt the staff truly enjoyed their work, and made us feel like we were appreciated and wanted as guests. Delphine made our last night of the trip so incredible we both left Hotel Martinez the next morning firmly resolving to return as soon as we could.\n\nThere aren't enough words to explain how magical this trip was for us - many thanks to the staff for creating this beautiful memory for us.",

Every staff member I interacted with was professional, kind, and genuinely seemed to care that guests were having a good time. Nothing ever felt rushed or transactional – it was warm and personal.\nOverall, everything about my stay felt smooth and effortless, from check-in to check-out.

Interpretive signage is in both French and English.\n\nThe house tour (French) was interesting and gives you the chance to learn more about the history of the property and see more of Henry Clew's bizarre artwork, if you're into that sort of thing.\n\nThe only downside was the garden. While the garden is \"pretty\", I find it rather horticulturally lacking. It's a shame considering it would be a stunning example of an Arts and Crafts style garden given the proper oversight of a garden curator with trained staff. Hedges and trees have not been properly trimmed in a while, weeds are rampant, the pool is in disrepair and full of algae, the lawns look raggedy, the footpaths need to be weeded, the pergola lacks any sort of interesting climbing flowering interest such as wisteria or laburnum, many borders are left unplanted and are rather filled with weeds, and the few containers that are planted are rather uninspired, featuring just white petunias.\n\nI did notice that there is one area of the garden undergoing renovation (which is accessible only during the house tour), however the garden staff does not seem to be trained in caring for a historic property. They had a pile of dirt directly on one of the historic Arts and Crafts style stone patios, from which they were shoveling directly, no protection covering the patio.\n\nHiring a head gardener with experience in preserving gardens on historic properties would take this castle to a 5 star visit.",

The island is not big but a perfect place to spend a few hours, you can even bring some lunch and have a picnic, just a note that you have to hold on to your trash since you cannot leave any trash on the island so bring an extra bag if you bring snacks or anything. The views and surroundings are so beautiful and very peaceful. They actually have a big outdoor restaurant, we didn't try it but looked decent.",

It's a quiet, spiritual place with history. If you're interested in Christianity, history, wine, or just discovering something off the beaten path, this is a fascinating stop.\n\nYou might even get the chance to speak with the monks, which adds a meaningful touch to the experience. From an entertainment point of view, there may not be much to \"do,\" but it's a great place to reflect and enjoy the natural beauty – including beaches, rocky coastlines, and beautiful views. There's also a restaurant on the island. One important note: there are no trash bins, so you'll need to take any garbage back with you.\n\nFerries run every hour from Cannes and back, making it very easy to plan a day trip. I definitely recommend visiting",
