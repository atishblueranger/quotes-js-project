It felt like traveling through the whole country in just a few hours. My favorite parts were steering the ships through the canals, controlling the helicopter, and interacting with the fun exhibits like attracting the fishes.\n\nThe park is very well designed, with so many details that bring Dutch history, architecture, and culture to life. It's both educational and entertaining, making it a great place for families, couples, or solo travelers. I would recommend it as one of the first stops for tourists visiting the Netherlands.\n\nThe staff were very friendly and welcoming, which made the experience even better. Parking was a little pricey, but that might just be my perspective as a visitor from abroad. Overall, I would definitely like to return and see it again.",

While the entrance fee is on the higher side, the overall atmosphere and maintenance are quite good. The park area isn't very big, but it's packed with detailed and well-made exhibits.\n\nOur child especially enjoyed the small interactive games scattered throughout the park. One highlight was the movie journey inside a real airplane - a creative touch that shows the thoughtfulness behind the park's design.\n\nThe children's playground was also a hit, offering a fun space for kids to burn off some energy.\n\nOverall, we highly recommend this park for families with children.

It is spacious so even when crowded still does not feel full. The little book you receive at entry gives lots of background on every art piece. Some of the art would place in my house, so interesting and cool. Also enjoyed the pop-up shop and regular shop. The candy special that required a time-slot was very nice, go in line timely, but it goes quite fast. This special part required shoes off. For those that can't take off their shoes there are shoe covers. Spent around 2,5/3 hours in the museum. Also beautiful landscaping outside.",

The artworks are all special in their own way, and each room offers something different. A standout for us was the marshmallow house - playful and unexpected, it really stood out as a highlight.\n\nThere are a few practical things to note. You are not allowed to take even a water bottle inside, so plan accordingly. Also, the toilets are located outside the main building, which means you have to walk a bit to reach them.\n\nOverall, a unique and engaging museum experience. We give it 4 out of 5 stars.\nden",

I loved every moment of my few hours (yes that's all you need here). I really took my time walking around, reading pretty much everything. There's a  summary as you enter each room/ gallery. I was really impressed by floor 3. Modern pieces that interpret the mind bending greatness of Eschers works, so do go up to the top floor.\nMy biggest takeaway was how massively inspired/influenced/ motivated Escher was by the Islamic art and architecture of South Spain/ Andalucia. In the narrative there was more emphasis on his time in Italy and the wonderful landscapes there, but in my opinion Andalucia changed something in him towards the magnificent work we all really know him for, tessalations, metamorphosis, patterns, perspective etc. A memorable visit!",

The park is well thought out for small children.\n\nA few practical notes: The lockers weren't working, and the park is quite large. If you're coming with extra belongings, I recommend bringing something to help you carry them easily, a stroller can be very helpful, even if you think your child won't need it much.\n\nThe women's toilets near the restaurant area were insufficient; it's better to use the ones in other parts of the park.\n\nI suggest arriving early in the morning and starting from the far end of the park, going against the general flow. That way, you'll avoid long queues at the first attractions.",

While I personally enjoyed the visit, most of the rides and attractions are clearly designed with younger kids in mind. It's a great place for a relaxed day out, but adults seeking thrill rides might find the options limited. That said, there are still a few exciting rides for older visitors, like the fast roller coaster Formule X, the wild mouse-style ride Kopermijn, the spinning coaster Twistrix, and the powered coaster Dynamite Express. Additionally, adults can enjoy rides like Nautilus, a swinging and spinning attraction, and Draaikolk, a fast-turning ride. As a whole, it's a highly recommended destination for families with kids.",

            "text": "The three of us chose this place for breakfast - we'd been wanting to come for a while!\n\nLuckily, we managed to find a table inside, towards the back. However, the interior is small and the tables are quite cramped, so I wouldn't say it's the most comfortable setting. It might be better if you can find a spot outside on a nice day.\n\nOne of us ordered the avocado on sourdough, another had the Turkish eggs, and I went for the mushrooms on brioche. Everyone was really happy with their food - everything was truly delicious. The combination of the mushrooms with the butterbean purée and eggs… absolutely unforgettable. I'll definitely be coming back 😍",

The best cappuccino, excellent service, a great selection of food, and a casual atmosphere that's perfect for what you're looking for in a brunch. The bread is truly unique. I just wish they had more dishes, as that would mean more chances to try their delicious food. One thing to improve: I'd love the cappuccino to be served hotter, since with cold milk it's just not the same.",
