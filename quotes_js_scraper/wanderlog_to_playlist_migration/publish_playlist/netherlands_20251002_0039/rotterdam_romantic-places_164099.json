The room is clean, well stocked, very large with king bed, sitting area, music system, coffee, fridge, and great soaking tub.  People are on the platform until 9pm which we thought might be weird.  The windows are mirrored, so people can't see in (except at dark outside with lights on inside).  The people watching was actually fun for us and added to the experience.  At night and morning, you have the deck to yourself which is just amazing.  Breakfast in the room was amazing.  If you are thinking maybe to stay and you can stretch your budget to make it work, it is worth every cent.  Loved our experience here.",

They have some rarities like WCS94 rethemed to Kill Bill, 60th anniversary James Bond, music pinballs like Iron Maiden, GnR, Metallica and some really cool and unique stuff.

There are small bridges over canals that add a lot of charm to the place and make the views even more special.\n\nThere's also free parking available, which makes visiting even more convenient.\n\nIn one part of the garden, there's a large bird enclosure with finches, Chinese doves, quails, and a few other small birds. It's lovely to see them, although if you care about animals being free, it might feel a bit sad to see them inside a cage.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys nature and peaceful walks.",

We spent a lovely afternoon there, enjoying a delicious chicken dish served with a syringe – not only was it full of flavor, but the presentation was also delightfully surprising. The cocktails were fantastic and perfectly complemented the experience. The service was top-notch – our waiter Andrew was extremely professional, and the whole team was very friendly and attentive. We truly felt well taken care of. I highly recommend this place – perfect for a tasty and memorable afternoon! 🌟🍸🍽️",

And a friendly reminder, don't panic if you see the doors closed some time before your reservation, the same staff also assists you through the exhibition, thats why they close doors during an exhibition.",

When I asked for the price of my beer the waitress told me a completely different price (with a 2€ difference), something I didn't really understand.\n\nAnother thing was when we ordered the fries, she told us they can only make the loaded fries. No problem until we see that those \"loaded fries\" are not on the menu as well and of course, the price is higher than it was for the normal fries.\n\nBesides these little things that felt like a scam, really, the view is really nice, it was sunny and beautiful. A lot of stairs to climb to reach the toilet which for the \"premium\" experience they pretend they are offering..the bathrooms are pretty dirty :)",

The carefully curated selection of craft beers and spirits complemented the meal perfectly. We were pleasantly surprised by the dry, not-too-sweet taste of the natural orange wine we paired with our dinner.\n\nThe attentive and knowledgeable staff made us feel welcome from the moment we arrived.

We wanted to have some peace and quiet, enjoy our meal and recover from the stressful day, which worked out 1 to 1! The restaurant was almost empty as most people were upstairs (a creative workshop was taking place there), which worked in our favour. We decided to go for the respective courses and I have to be honest, the starters blew me away! The hummus was just perfect and looking at someone else's order I could tell that the portions outside of the course menu were huge! I was more than full after the smaller portion! The burgers were also very tasty, as were the desserts! The service was very nice and attentive and we had a great time there! Definitely worth a visit if you enjoy good vegan food!",

Though, I am strongly against the trend where the menus are English only (so not in native Dutch). My nephews needed translation help, while they're in their home city. Which is ridiculous in my opinion..",

The place is clean and tidy, but the service was very slow; at one point people were even shouting to get the staff's attention. Outdoor seating is available, though not very cozy, and the overall vibe isn't particularly kids-friendly. Great food, but the atmosphere and service leave room for improvement.",
