It’s a narrow river valley which houses everything from rock-climbing centers to pulsing bars and pubs, and on both sides of the river the peaks of the French Alps explode thousands of feet into the sky. While there are numerous ways to experience the grandeur of the mountains from Chamonix—boarding the ski lift at Les Grands Montets, biking along the steep ridges, or paragliding off the many peaks—the most accessible might be a ride on the Aiguille du Midi cable car, a hair-raising ascent that gains 9,200 vertical feet over the course of 20 minutes.",

We originally wanted to go just go up to the mid section, but the lady at the ticket office convinced us to go up to the summit saying it was a one in a lifetime experience. And she was absolutely correct. The view is gorgeous, breathtaking. It is better to go up earlier in the morning because there is considerably less people, which makes everything a bit easier - shorter lines for the Void and the elevator to the top, and less crowded viewpoints.",

Even in hot weather it gets cold at the top and there is snow and ice yet an hour before I was in 90 degree heat, very strange haha. It is not a quick visit though, so if you have to get back in time for your bus or coach then book your visit to the mountain and give yourself several hours because once you are up there you cannot just get back down, so allow plenty of time. This is a place that everyone should experience at least once 🏔️",

The shelters are so good organized you don't feel like you are outside on one of the 11th peak...\nWe wen to the restaurant downstairs and it isn't so overpriced Like you can take a Brioches with Cappuccino at 4 Euros!!!\nEven in Milan You can't get an offer like that... We ate typical Salumi and cheese with hot chocolate... Great Great Experience!!!\nSo yeah you can also visit it in every season and in March they also open the way to the France, You can come with your ski and do ski alpinism or throw yourself with the Paragliding with any problem.\nThe price to reach the peak is only 45 euros per person...",

            "text": "Le Brévent is one of the most renowned and accessible spots to enjoy a panoramic view of the majestic Mont Blanc. This location offers a truly beautiful experience for visitors, combining convenience with stunning natural beauty.\n\nFor those arriving by car, parking is available at the paid «Parking du Brévent», where an 8-hour stay costs EUR 10.- as of August 2024.\nFrom there, your adventure begins with a cable car ride to Planpraz. I recommend continuing on to Le Brévent for the full experience. A one-way ticket to «Le Brévent» costs EUR 26.-.\n\nPlanpraz: The first stop, is a must-see. From here, you'll be treated to breathtaking views of Mont Blanc, the Aiguille du Midi, and other nearby summits. It's a perfect spot for photography or simply taking in the grandeur of the Alps.\n\nFrom Planpraz, hop on the cable car to Le Brévent, where you'll be rewarded with one of the most spectacular panoramic views of Mont Blanc. The scenery from this vantage point is unparalleled, making it a highlight of any trip to the region.\n\nIf you have time, consider dining at the restaurant \"Le Panoramic\" at the top. The food is good, and the views from the restaurant are just as impressive. However, it's advisable to book in advance, as it's a popular spot.\n\nFor those who enjoy hiking, there's the option to descend on foot from Le Brévent to Planpraz. The hike takes around 1 hour and 15 minutes, offering more incredible views along the way. Once back at Planpraz, you have several options to return to Chamonix (Parking Le Brévent):\n\n1. Take the cable car: back down for a quick and easy return.\n2. Walk the short path back: which is a bit challenging and takes around 2 hours.\n3. Opt for the longer walk, which takes about 3 hours but is less difficult than the shorter path.\n\nLe Brévent is a destination that perfectly combines accessibility with awe-inspiring natural beauty. Whether you're there for a quick visit or a full day of exploration, the views and experiences offered here are truly unforgettable.\n\nFor the courageous and well-trained, there's also the option to do a round trip from Chamonix to Le Brévent entirely on foot. This challenging hike offers an immersive experience with the stunning Alpine scenery, but you should be prepared to spend at least 7 hours on the trail. It's a demanding journey, but the rewards of the breathtaking views along the way make it well worth the effort.\n\nEnjoy 😎🧘‍♂️🙏☀️🏔️",

The first half, to the Chalet des Pyramides is easy, gradient is steady and low and you can easily keep your pace. Some of the hikers finish here, you can have a modest lunch in the chalet, the view on the Bossons glacier is majestic.\n\nThe second half is tougher as the path becomes much steeper and in some places requires some basic climbing skills.

The children were clearly already experienced hikers despite their age.\n\nIt took me just under 3 hours to climb to la Jonction from the télésiege arrival point.",

There's only one way down and one way in and out, and the walkway isn't very wide - so this is best enjoyed when it's not packed with people. It wasn't very cold inside in June, unless you intend to stay long then a light jacket would do. 10-15 mins was sufficient to walk through even with kids, or you can stay longer to cool off from the summer heat. Worth the experience if you are already coming up here, and also there's not much else to do if you're not hiking.
