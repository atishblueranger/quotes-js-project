This romantic spot has, for hundreds of years, attracted many scholars, writers, and painters who came here in search of creative inspiration.",

I think 3 days is enough to explore Colmar, but honestly, I wouldn't mind staying for 7–10 days - especially if you plan to visit nearby villages or cities in France or even Germany, since it's so close to the border.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a peaceful and picturesque getaway.",

Parking is well organized, there are several marked parking lots and you can drive very close to the canal and park in the square, it was very busy, but we found a place. About 100 meters away is the canal restaurant, where you board the boat, tickets are sold in the restaurant. We waited about 20 minutes for our boat and so we had prosecco. I definitely recommend the cruise, it is a beautiful experience. You sail past historic houses lined with restaurants to the old market, which is definitely worth a visit, you can taste local specialties there. Behind the market, the boat turns and you sail back and further towards the historic bridge to the beautiful romantic corners of Colmar, like in Monet's paintings.",

It is also very big and you might get easily lost.\nI loved the crazy amount of local food and drink specialities you could buy. The little museums are also worth a visit.\n\nThe only negative aspects are the crowds. The market is very popular and there are way too many people cramped in those small alleyways.\nAlso I had to park 2km away from the market in a residential area, since every car park was full.",

The annual Christmas Market is held during Advent (late November until 29 December each year. There are signs from Colmar Central Station clearly pointing the way to the city centre and main market squares, the walk is around 12-15 minutes. The market is up and running from around 10am each morning.\n\nThe Christmas Market in Colmar is spread out over a handful of public squares where you find traditional Christmas market stalls selling hot wine, seasonal food, holiday ornamentations, gifts and related items. Everything blends in nicely with the medieval appearance of the city centre, creating great atmosphere to enjoy the holiday season. It was also nice seeing the larger scale Christmas trees and tall Noel Pyramid and other Christmas themed entertainment for families at Place Rapp. All in all, we spent around 5 hours enjoying the market and sightseeing before catching train back to Strasbourg in the mid afternoon.",
