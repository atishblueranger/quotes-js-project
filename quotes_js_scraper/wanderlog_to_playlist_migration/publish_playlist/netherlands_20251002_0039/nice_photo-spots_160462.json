While opinions vary-some adore them, others find them unattractive-no one remains indifferent to their presence. These seven resin statues, located in the heart of Nice at Massena Square, were crafted by Jaume Plensa, a Spanish artist renowned for his monumental works.\n\nThe statues symbolize the seven continents and the interconnectedness of diverse communities in modern society. Titled *Conversation à Nice*, the installation embodies the idea of global dialogue. Each night, the statues are illuminated, with colors shifting gently to evoke a sense of communication and exchange between them. The effect is both visually stunning and deeply poetic.",

There are some amazing views and photo opportunities and the whole area has a lovely vibe, tourists and locals mixing together.\n\nWe walked up there from our hotel, The Palais Ségurane boutique hotel on Rue Catherine Ségurane. It started off with a gentle ramp and there various sets of steps from time to time but if you're relatively fit you'll mange it without too much problem.\n\nWe just explored the routes, essentially if you keep heading upwards you won't go far wrong. Once at the top there are several different areas, some open spaces, a couple of food stalls, a toilet (0.5 Euros), some amazing vantage points, a performance area and of course the famous waterfall.\n\nThe views out over Nice are quite astounding and it's easy to lose yourself watching the world go by in miniature beneath you. We also tried to work out where we'd been in the city.\n\nWe didn't try to use the elevator which I imagine can get busy. The walks up and down tend to spread people out and there are little diversions and resting areas.\n\nGiven the proximity to the old town it's easy to make a full day of the area.",

It's not your average market - it's a full sensory experience and one of the most authentic places to sample local flavors.\n\nWandering through the colorful stalls, we were instantly drawn in by the scent of fresh blooms and sizzling street food. We tried socca, a crispy chickpea pancake hot off the griddle - warm, slightly smoky, perfectly salted. An absolute must. Just around the corner, we discovered a sweet surprise: a tiny tart with caramelized peanuts and salted butter caramel that was honestly unforgettable.\n\nThough it's not a sit-down restaurant, Cours Saleya is a food lover's paradise. Locals mix with visitors, the vibe is laid-back and lively, and everything feels real and rooted in the culture of the South of France. Whether you're grabbing a bite or just taking in the atmosphere, this spot is worth every minute.",
