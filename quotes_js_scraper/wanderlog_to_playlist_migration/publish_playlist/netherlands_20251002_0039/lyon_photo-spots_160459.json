Take the funicular (walking back down is nice) to get there. The Basilica is in such lovely condition. The murals look amazing and there is a real sense of peacefulness. Make sure you take the time to look closely at the murals. My favourite was the one depicting Joan of Arc. We went on a Saturday morning and it wasn't too busy. We didn't have to wait to go in. It is free to visit. There is a lovely courtyard next to the Basilica where you get some amazing views over Lyon.",

Situated in the heart of Vieux Lyon, this cathedral is not only an architectural masterpiece but also houses one of the most fascinating timepieces in Europe: the Lyon Astronomical Clock.\n\nConstruction of the cathedral began in 1180 and was completed in 1476, showcasing a harmonious blend of Romanesque and Gothic styles. As the seat of the Archbishop of Lyon, it has been central to the city's religious life for centuries. The cathedral's façade and interior are adorned with intricate details that reflect its historical importance .\n\nOne of the cathedral's most captivating features is its astronomical clock, a 9-meter-tall marvel dating back to the 14th century. Reconstructed in 1661 by Guillaume Nourrisson after its destruction in 1562, the clock is a testament to medieval engineering and artistry . ￼ ￼\n\nThe clock's intricate mechanism includes an astrolabe that indicates the date and positions of celestial bodies, as well as a perpetual calendar accurate until the year 3008 . Its automata perform a daily show at noon, 2 PM, 3 PM, and 4 PM, featuring figures like angels striking bells and a rooster crowing .",

So many pieces to look at. I was surprised at how well preserved many of them were. Some good interactive sections specifically for kids were also good to see. We got an entry included in our Lyon city pass but considering the size of the museum the entry price is very good. Well worth going to see when you head up to the Basilica.",

Everything has french and english explications. On the entrance to each permanent exposition, there was a guide who would give a general feel of the pieces, and they could speak English too!\nTheir temporary expositions were interesting and very well done, we went to the Amazon and the dreams ones, both very interesting. We didn't have to pay extra for these.\nThey had elevators for all stages, and there were a lot of audio explanations too.\nOn the terrace there was a lovely - albeit a bit expensive - cafe, with nice views.

Over time, they adapted to various needs—serving as safe havens during turbulent times and facilitating trade in silk when Lyon thrived as a production center.",
