I was speaking clear DUTCH, but the staff member seemed to intentionally misunderstand me - even trying to charge me for more items than I ordered. It wasn't busy at all (I was the only one ordering from the fast food side), yet she forgot my fries completely. Only when I returned 10 minutes later to ask if I could take them to go, did she finally put them in the fryer.\n\nWhen I got them, she dumped the fries directly on top of the mayonnaise instead of beside it. I asked for salt and was told they had none - which I found odd for a burger and fries place. On top of that, she was whispering things under her breath and acted very unfriendly, even though I remained polite and patient the entire time.\n\nReally unprofessional and unwelcoming service.
