Located in the Croix-Rousse district, this incredible trompe-l'œil (trick of the eye) painting spans an entire building façade and captures the spirit of the neighborhood's history and daily life with astonishing detail.\n\nFrom a distance, you might mistake it for an actual street scene. Windows, staircases, balconies, people chatting-everything is painted so realistically that it feels like the wall itself is alive. The mural pays tribute to the Canuts, Lyon's 19th-century silk workers, while also evolving over time to reflect the neighborhood's modern character.",

Dating back to the 4th century, these unique passages were initially designed to offer residents sheltered routes between their homes and the bustling River Saône. Over time, they adapted to various needs—serving as safe havens during turbulent times and facilitating trade in silk when Lyon thrived as a production center.",
