Every sculpture tells a story — from the finely detailed deities and dancers to the massive elephants and guardians that stand tall even after centuries.\n\nThe intricate carvings are so well preserved that you can almost feel the devotion and craftsmanship of the artisans who created them. The scale of the temple leaves you awestruck — towering walls, endless panels of mythological scenes, and the sense of standing inside history itself."

The caves are among a large numbers of similar caves excavated in the Sahyadri Hills in the early 1st millennium CE. There are altogether 16 caves in the group, with 3 of them being Mahayana caves. Most of the caves are lenas, with the major exception being the Great Chaitya, Cave No. 8.\n\nGreat Chaitya cave\nThe main cave, called the Great Chaitya cave, or Cave No. 8, features a large, intricately carved chaitya within a prayer hall, dating back to 50-70 CE. This is the largest rock-cut chaitya in India, measuring 45 metres (148 ft) long and up to 14 metres (46 ft) high. The hall features sculptures of both males and females, as well as animals such as lions and elephants.\n\nVerandah inscription mentioning the completion by Bhutapala\nThis Great Chaitya cave, the largest in South Asia, was probably constructed between 50 and 70 CE according to the paleography of the various donatory inscriptions. Numerous donors, mainly local merchants, several of them Yavanas (Greeks), as well as numerous Buddhist monks and nuns, provided donations for the construction of the chaitya cave, as recorded by their dedicatory inscriptions.\n\nIt is worth a visit and you have climb so be prepared. Entry free is Rs25.\nPlenty of parking. Visit during monsoon season."

The entry is 25 rupees (cash is recommended as reception at top isn’t good for UPI) and the line is separate from the temple’s line; price is too high for foreigners (no reason for 12 times the price as locals). The cave has two exhibits: the Buddhist monument and hall, and the cave quarters. The monument is gorgeous (entry requires removing footwear outside) but the quarters (footwear allowed) are dimly lit and not very well maintained (but the views from the top are good).

The temple is located right above the caves, and a separate entry path leads you there.\n\nTo enter Karla Caves, a ticket is required, which can be purchased at the site. Also, when visiting the Ekvira Devi temple, do note that sleeveless or western clothes are not allowed, so it’s best to dress modestly out of respect for temple customs.\n\nThe climb involves a number of steps, but the views, spiritual vibe, and historical richness make it worth the effort. A great spot for those interested in heritage, nature, and culture."

However, there are some ruined British era barracks seen on the way. Upon reaching the lake, there are some small stalls selling corn on the cob. This lake is beautiful and tranquil during the monsoon season. There is a dam located at the side of this lake. Also, there is a ruined British era barrack near the lake. One can get amazing views of the surrounding area and enjoy the cool breeze as well. This is an ideal place for families, couples as well as friends. It is not recommended for senior citizens as the road to the lake is steep and difficult. Overall, it a good place and is a must visit. It should not be missed."

Two wheelers might be more convenient. Part of the slope is \"katchha\" road. There is moderate parking at the top.\n\nIt was a beautiful lake, with a beautiful shore, with lush green grass (maybe because of the rainy season). We found it much better than Bhushi Dam (another popular tourist spot in Lonavala).\n\nIt's definitely worth a visit.\n\nP.S. For some reason, Google Maps took us along a wrong route. Better to ask the locals when nearby Tungarli."

It can be called as a photographer's paradise but the sad part is that the place is littered with beer bottles broken and cigarette packets dumped just near the water..you have to be very careful while walking..ideal place for a day picnic but need to carry your own food and water as there are no shops nearby for the same..not advisable to go into the water as it is very deep and you might come across locals who will warn you if they see you entering into the lake..very very calm a if you are ready to ignore all the broken pieces of bottles and cigarette packets littered, this is one of the best places to visit in Lonavala..cheers✌️"

              "reviewText": "Kune Falls, nestled between Lonavala and Khandala, is a breathtaking three-tiered waterfall and one of the tallest in Maharashtra, plunging from a height of around 200 meters (660 feet). Surrounded by lush green valleys and mist-covered cliffs, Kune Falls is a spectacular sight, especially during the monsoon season when it is in full force. The sound of the water crashing down, the cool breeze, and the scenic backdrop create a serene and refreshing atmosphere that instantly lifts your mood.\n\nThis waterfall is perfect for families, couples, and nature lovers alike. It’s also a favorite among adventure seekers who enjoy trekking, photography, or just spending time in nature. However, reaching the base of the falls may require a short walk or light trek, so wearing comfortable footwear is advised. During peak monsoon, access can be restricted for safety, so checking ahead is a good idea.\n\nWhat makes Kune Falls special is its majestic drop in three distinct stages, creating a stunning natural cascade. The surrounding landscape is perfect for a peaceful picnic or simply soaking in the natural beauty. It's a great spot for clicking panoramic photos and spending quality time away from city life.\n\nOverall, Kune Falls is a must-visit if you're traveling to Lonavala. It offers a combination of natural beauty, tranquility, and a bit of adventure—a truly rejuvenating experience."

From the moment you enter, you're greeted with stunning architecture, beautifully maintained gardens, and a sense of peace that's hard to find elsewhere. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Narayani and is a relatively new but grand structure with intricate carvings and a majestic aura.\n\nThe cleanliness and organization of the temple premises are impressive — everything from the shoe counters to the prasad area is well-managed. There's also a small gaushala (cow shelter), and the overall atmosphere is calm and spiritual.\n\nA great plus is the temple's accommodation and dining facilities. The bhojanalaya serves simple, sattvic food that adds to the spiritual vibe of the place. It’s an ideal spot not just for devotees, but also for anyone looking for a peaceful getaway amidst nature."

It is well maintained and kept very clean, which immediately adds to the positive atmosphere as soon as you enter. A thoughtful facility provided here is the free shoe-keeping area, making it convenient for devotees to leave their footwear without any hassle.\n\nInside the temple, there are three main deities—Lord Ganesha, Goddess Durga Mata, and Lord Hanuman. The arrangements and the sanctity of the space make it a pleasant experience for worshippers. Another interesting feature of this temple is that it offers food coupons on a first-come, first-served basis, which I believe are priced around ₹300 for lunch. I’m not certain about dinner availability, but it’s a great option if you’re planning to spend some time here.\n\nFor those who wish to stay overnight or longer, the temple also has rooms available for accommodation. I’ve attached the visiting card in the photo for contact details so you can check and confirm directly. The temple premises also include a Gowshala (cow shelter), where you can feed cows for a small cost—a nice spiritual and cultural experience. Parking is not an issue here, as there is ample space for cars, and if you need local transport, autos are easily available outside the temple.\n\nOverall, it’s a well-organized and peaceful temple that combines devotion, good facilities, and thoughtful services for visitors."

Peace, tranquility and absence of forceful behaviour by Pujari, makes one want to stay on forever. I was pleasantly impressed to see, caretaker take offerings and putting into donation boxes. Token system is available for tea, meals and prasad. The arena is well spaced and aired for sitting for extended time on footsteps of Goddess. Hostel facilities exist and is well subscribed. Online booking of meals is suggested since limited tokens are available."

Located atop a small hill near Lonavala, the temple is a sacred place for devotees, especially from the Koli community. Be ready for a moderate climb of around 200 steps, but the divine energy and scenic view at the top make it totally worth it.\n\nAdjacent to the temple are the ancient Karla Caves—Buddhist rock-cut caves dating back over 2000 years. The main chaitya (prayer hall) with its massive pillars and carved details is breathtaking. The whole area offers a peaceful and spiritual experience with a touch of history and nature.\n\nTips:\n\nVisit early in the morning to avoid crowds and heat.\n\nWear comfortable shoes.\n\nLocal food and refreshments are available at the base.\n\nA must-visit spot if you’re in or around Lonavala!"

Lion’s Point offers some of the best panoramic views in Lonavala, especially during the monsoon when the hills are lush and waterfalls are everywhere. The sunrise and sunset views are breathtaking. There are plenty of food stalls selling hot tea, corn, and snacks—perfect for enjoying the cool breeze. The area can get crowded on weekends, so I recommend going early in the morning or on a weekday for a more peaceful experience. Don’t forget good shoes—the terrain can get slippery. A must-visit if you’re in Lonavala!"

The cool breeze, mist-covered cliffs, and peaceful silence made it a perfect hill station vibe.\n\nWe started our journey from Hyderabad to Pune City by bus (travels). Before reaching, I had booked a car via ZOOM Cars — selected a Renault Duster, but surprise! After reaching Pune, the Duster was unavailable, and they gave us a Kia Carens instead — a big and comfy car! We laughed saying, “Even if we don’t get a hotel, we can sleep in this car only!” 😄\n\nSpeaking of hotels, I had pre-booked a room via OYO, but unfortunately, the hotel declined our booking when we arrived. 😤 That was disappointing, but we didn’t give up — we searched nearby and actually found a better place to stay than the one we had booked. So, a small twist turned into a good thing!\n\nWe roamed around all of Lonavala, checking out the viewpoints, local stalls, and enjoyed the misty weather — just perfect for a relaxing trip away from city chaos.\n\nTips for Travelers:\n\nBe prepared for unexpected weather and hotel changes.\n\nBook trusted stays and double-confirm.\n\nIf you're visiting in monsoon or post-monsoon — fog is guaranteed!\n\nCarry warm clothes and a camera for some Insta-worthy shots!\n\nLonavala is a must-visit for nature lovers and peace seekers. Lion Point was a foggy fairyland. I’ll definitely visit again with more friends!\n\n👉 After staying for two days in Lonavala, we headed to Devkund Waterfall. 🌊"

Based on recent reviews and travel guides (as of June 27th, 2025), here's what you can expect:\n\nTop Things to Do:\n\nExplore Caves: Karla and Bhaja Caves are ancient Buddhist caves with intricate carvings, highly recommended by many visitors.\n\nForts and Treks: Lohagad Fort, Rajmachi Fort, and Tiger's Leap offer stunning views and challenging treks for adventure seekers. Duke's Nose is another popular trekking spot.\n\nWaterfalls and Dams: Bhushi Dam is a picturesque spot, especially during the monsoon season. Kune Falls and Kataldhar Waterfall are also worth visiting. Pawna Lake offers boating and camping opportunities.\n\nOther Attractions: Consider visiting Lonavala Lake, Ryewood Park, Imagicaa theme park, Aamby Valley, and Sunil's Celebrity Wax Museum.\n\nVisitor Feedback:\n\nReviews are generally positive, highlighting the scenic beauty, especially during the monsoon season. However, some reviewers mention overcrowding, particularly on weekends, and suggest maintaining cleanliness in tourist areas. Bhushi Dam and Lion's Point are frequently mentioned as highlights, while some viewpoints like Tiger's Point are considered \"overhyped\" by some.\n\nTips for Planning Your Trip:\n\nBest Time to Visit: The monsoon season (June-September) is popular for its lush greenery and waterfalls, but be prepared for rain and slippery roads. Winter (October-February) offers pleasant weather for trekking and sightseeing.\n\nAccommodation: Book accommodations in advance, especially during peak season. Options range from budget-friendly hotels to luxury resorts.\n\nTransportation: Lonavala is easily accessible by road, rail, and air. The Mumbai-Pune Expressway offers a scenic route.\n\nLocal Cuisine: Don't miss trying the famous Lonavala chikki (a sweet snack).\n\nRemember that this information is based on current reviews and may change over time. I recommend checking recent reviews closer to your travel dates for the most up-to-date information."

You can have a glimps of naval expertise of maratha empire and collection of beautiful rocks and stones from the Era. If you are in your 40s, you would be knowing many things but good for new generation kids who haven't seen village life. Along side there is also a scary  pathway.

We tried the sandwich and strawberry ice cream with fruits – both tasted really good.

Since we visited during a long weekend, there was even a joker show for entertainment.\n\nOverall, I’d recommend everyone to visit at least once.\n\nP.S. – Don’t be misled by the name.

It’s spacious, with plenty of free parking, and gives you the vibe of Mahabaleshwar—just without the strawberry farms. Instead, you’ll find lots of quirky selfie points and picture-perfect corners, making it a fun spot for photography lovers.\n\nFamilies with kids will especially enjoy the extra attractions—think trampolines, fun games, and little activities that keep the young ones busy while you relax. The food here is surprisingly good for a highway stop—service is quick, staff are polite, and the Margarita Pizza is a must-try. Oh, and don’t leave without treating yourself to their Strawberry with Cream—it’s a sweet little indulgence that hits just right.\n\nWashrooms are decent (not the highlight, but manageable), and overall the place makes for a cheerful break in your journey. Definitely better than just a fuel stop—this one adds a bit of travel memory to the drive!"

The place has a nice and relaxing ambiance, perfect for a casual outing.\n\nWe tried their most popular item — the strawberry cream with ice cream — but honestly, it was not worth the hype, and the ingredients felt very basic (probably worth ₹20 max), yet the price was ₹360 + 5% GST. Way too overpriced for what you get.\n\nNice place to sit and relax, but wouldn’t recommend the strawberry cream if you’re looking for value for money."

Sunset Cafe isn’t fancy , it’s more like a small kitchen in the clouds , but that’s exactly what makes it special.\n\nIt’s run by a single vendor, who’s super kind and humble. There’s a nice little garden outside, and the view of the foggy clouds and hills is absolutely magical. The peaceful vibe makes it perfect for a quiet tea break with family.\n\nI tried the corn pizza and sandwiches, both were tasty, and the coffee was warm and comforting in the rain. The fog rolling through the hills while sipping tea or coffee is something you just have to experience.\n\nHighly recommend stopping here if you want a break from the highway rush and a moment of peace with nature."

This stunning waterfall, situated near the town of Amboli in Maharashtra, is a must-visit destination for nature lovers and adventure seekers.\n\nAs I approached the waterfall, I was struck by its sheer beauty. The water cascades down a rocky cliff, creating a misty veil that surrounds the entire area. The roar of the waterfall is almost deafening, and the cool mist on my skin was a welcome respite from the summer heat.\n\nWhat I loved most about the Zenith Waterfall was its serene and peaceful atmosphere. The surrounding area is lush and green, with dense forests and rolling hills that seem to stretch on forever. It's the perfect spot to relax, unwind, and connect with nature.\n\nThe waterfall is also a popular spot for trekking and hiking, with several trails that offer breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape. However, be sure to exercise caution when approaching the waterfall, as the rocks can be slippery and the water currents can be strong.\n\nOverall, the Zenith Waterfall is a breathtaking natural wonder that is sure to leave you spellbound.

The river flowing through the ashram adds to the serene ambiance, perfect for meditation and reflection. The premises are clean and well-maintained, and the prasad served is simple yet tasty.\n\nRooms are basic but comfortable for a short spiritual retreat. It can get crowded during weekends or special occasions, and parking is a bit of a challenge.\n\nOverall, a great place for spiritual seekers and those looking to disconnect from city life. 🙏"

Divine environment, soul satisfying  views thats refresh your mind &  calm your soul with the temple environment with beauty of nature 🍀.\nEasy to reach there, in weekends it's crowded  but in weekdays you can easily get the darshan & the peaceful environment of ashram & nature view. It's truly divine feeling  thats gives you peace of mind. Temple & its path is well managed by the management everything is neat & clean. I suggest if you really want to experience spiritual outing then must visit this place specially in morning or evening.\nBest place to visit with family or friends. Infront of the ashram there is limited shop for snacks. Location wise easy to reach there from outside of the station you can get sharing rickshaw & they charge 15 rupess per person. If you want direct rickshaw for you then the rate is 40 rupees.\n\nImportant information specially for girls :-If you plan to visit this place then wear something ethnic you can pair it with jeans. Avoid to wear sleeveless kurti or tops & please carry scarf with you because here it's mandatory otherwise  security gaurd don't allow you to enter this place."

We performed the arti and had the Mahaprasad, which was simple but tasty hot food consisting of subzi, rice, dal, and sheera. The atmosphere is very peaceful, making it a great spiritual and picnic spot to visit with family, alone, or with a couple"
