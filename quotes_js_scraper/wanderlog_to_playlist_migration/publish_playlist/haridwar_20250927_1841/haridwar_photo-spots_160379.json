Tickets were priced at ₹240 per person. It was quite hot that day, but the short ropeway ride - just a few minutes from the bottom to the hilltop - was comfortable and offered beautiful views.\n\nThe temple itself has a simple and peaceful architecture, which adds to its charm. However, be prepared for long queues at every step, from the ropeway boarding point to the temple entrance and inside the temple premises. Despite the crowd, the overall experience was spiritually uplifting.\n\nThe ropeway is well-managed, and the staff was helpful, but due to the heat and waiting time, it's a good idea to carry water and maybe visit earlier in the day. Overall, a memorable visit to one of Haridwar's most sacred spots!",

Early Morning Trekking is also good option to enjoy panaramic view.\n\nYou can either buy combo of Mansa devi and chandi devi temple the only thing is you should be able to reach both temples on the same day if there's no long queues then it's easy. When we went in 2022 combo charges 324 rs per person while only chandi devi temple ticket charges 195 rs per person.\n\nTemple is clean and well maintained. Temple premises contains idols of lord kali ma, sankat mochan hanuman, Maa Annapurna, Santoshi Maa etc. This siddhpeeth is heavy crowded on festive like Navratri and holiday season. There are waiting halls at each levels and quite nice dining cafe inside and children game area to spend sometime.

It is one of three such Peethas located in Haridwar, the other two being Mansa Devi Temple and Maya Devi Temple.\n\nGoddess Chandi also known as Chandika is the presiding deity of the temple. The story of the origin of Chandika is as follows: Long time ago, the demon kings Shumbha and Nishumbha had captured the kingdom of the god-king of heaven - Indra and thrown the gods from Swarga (heaven). After intense prayers by the gods, a goddess emerged from Parvati. An exceptionally beautiful woman and amazed by her beauty, Shumbha desired to marry her. On being refused, Shumbha sent his demon chiefs Chanda and Munda to kill her. They were killed by goddess Chamunda who originated out of Chandika's anger. Shumbha and Nishumbha then collectively tried to kill Chandika but were instead slain by the goddess. Thereafter, Chandika is said to have rested for a short while at the top of Neel Parvat and later a temple was built here to testify the legend. Also, the two peaks located in the mountain range are called Shumbha and Nishumbha.",

So one need not leave it near any shop and then be forced to buy stuff from them. There is a coconut breaking area at the back... Otherwise all the pooja stuff we buy is dumped into a box. So avoid buying those small red bags for Rs.100. Darshan shall be quick and one will get ample time to see and pray mata ji.

This sacred site holds deep significance in Hindu mythology, marking the place where King Daksha performed his yajna and where Goddess Sati, overcome with grief and devotion, surrendered herself to the sacred fire.\n\nThe temple echoes the divine tale of Lord Shiva's sorrow, the creation of Virbhadra, and the eternal love between Shiva and Sati - a story of cosmic energy, sacrifice, and spiritual union. Even today, the energy here is palpable - peaceful yet deeply powerful.\n\nAs you walk through the temple's corridors, you don't just witness devotion… you feel it. The gentle chimes of the bells, the fragrance of incense, and the chants in the air transport you to another realm. It's a place where time slows down, where the heart feels light, and where the spirit quietly bows.\n\nA must-visit for every spiritual traveler, devotee, or seeker of divine peace. Daksheswar Mahadev Temple is not just a destination - it's a divine moment carved into the heart of Haridwar.\n\nReview by @the_solo_wanderer_\nFor more stories and spiritual travel moments, search me on Instagram. 🌿📸",

Located just 500–800 m. from Haridwar Junction, the temple is surrounded by lush greenery and forest trails, offering a peaceful atmosphere away from the city crowd. Devotees praise the tranquil vibe, especially in the early mornings. The temple is well-maintained, has no entry fee, and puja items are easily available nearby. Photography inside is generally restricted. It's particularly vibrant during Mahashivratri and the month of Sawan, when devotees flock here for blessings. Some paths through the forest are slightly uneven, which may be challenging for elderlyl or disabled visitors. A unique tradition here is placing layered stone structures (mannat) as a prayer for home-building and fulfillment of personal wishes. Visit is recommended for its spiritual aura, accessibility, and connection to Haridwar's rich religious traditions.\nToilets and water facilities available.\n\nTimings: morning to evening",

Nestled in the foothills of the Shivalik range near Haridwar, this lesser-known gem offers a perfect blend of wilderness, peace, and raw natural beauty. The dense sal forests, sparkling rivers, and vast grasslands create a breathtaking landscape that immediately puts your soul at ease.\n\nOne of the most captivating parts of the park is its rich biodiversity. I was lucky enough to spot elephants, peacocks, deer, and a variety of birds. The sheer thrill of being so close to wildlife in their natural habitat is an experience that stays with you long after you leave. The early morning safari was especially enchanting - mist floating over the riverbed, sunlight piercing through the trees, and the sounds of the forest waking up made it truly unforgettable.\n\nRajaji is also less crowded compared to other national parks, which means you get to enjoy nature without the noise and chaos of too many tourists. It's the kind of place that reminds you how powerful and peaceful nature can be.\n\nWhether you're a wildlife lover, a nature photographer, or someone looking to escape city life and reconnect with nature, Rajaji National Park is a must-visit. It's not just a destination - it's an experience that fills you with awe and calm.",

The IIT Roorkee(Earlier Roorkee University) at Roorkee is one of the oldest and prestigious institute of learning in the fields of science and engineering. Another university of the district i.e. Gurukul having vast campus is giving traditional educations of its own kind.\nThe followers of Lord Shiva(Har) and followers of Lord Vishnu(Hari) pronounce this place Hardwar and Hardwar respectively as told by some. It is also a point of entry to Dev Bhoomi and Char Dham  (Four main centers of pilgrimage in Uttarakhand) Viz.  Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.\n\nLegendary king Bhagirath is said to have brought the river Ganga from heaven to earth in order to provide salvation to his ancestors. It is also said that Haridwar has been sanctified by the presence of three Gods; Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. Lord Vishnu is said to have his foot print on the stone that is set in the upper wall of Har-Ki-Pauri where the Holy Ganga touches it all the times . Devout believers feel that they can go to heaven by getting their salvation after a dip in the sacred Ganga at Haridwar.\n\nHaridwar is also one of the four places; where Kumbh Mela occurs after rotation of every twelve Years and Ardh Kumbh after every six years. It is said that drops of Amrit (Elixir) fell in to the Brahmkund of Har-Ki-Pauri, therefore considered that a dip in the Brahmakund on this particular day which is very auspicious and when Jupiter (Brahaspati) comes to the sign Aquarius (Kumbh) once in every twelve years the Maha Kumbh fair is celebrated at Haridwar.\n\nOn somwati amaawas ,kumbh etc hindu famous religious days, there's a huge gathering.\nTo avoid any hazardous situation police divert the traffic even streetwalkers also diverted to rope defined area,that make you spend little more time on waiting and if you want to go Mansa devi and chandi Mata ( also attached a temple of mata anjana) you have to book your tickets on counter. On above said auspicious day you have to Book them online ( to use ropeway) other wise you can go through pagdandi or walking on road too.",

            "text": "Nestled on the banks of the Ganga Ghat, this ashram is an ideal sanctuary for meditation and spiritual pursuits, offering a serene environment that fosters inner peace and self-discovery. Established in 1944 by Hans Ji Maharaj, the ashram's origins trace back to a profound moment when he witnessed a snake and a mongoose drinking water together at the Ganga Ghat. Inspired by the harmonious energy of the place, he decided to create an ashram here. Today, the sprawling Prem Ashram is managed by Satpal Maharaj Ji and stands as a testament to its founder's vision.\n\nOne of the ashram's highlights is the Govardhan Hall, a massive space dedicated to satsang and meditation. As the largest hall in Asia, it spans 6,000 square meters and features a unique single-span design without supporting columns. Encircled by corridors on all four sides, the hall creates an awe-inspiring sense of vastness, capable of accommodating up to 25,000 people. Stepping inside, one feels as though they have entered a boundless, tranquil space.\n\nAnother notable feature is the sacred Panch Pallav tree, where five different trees-vata, pipal, pakar, mango, and gular-grow together from a single base. The leaves of this ancient tree are considered auspicious and are used in religious rituals. Symbolizing the five senses, the five leaves of Pancha Pallav are placed atop a water vessel during puja, representing the divine feminine energy.\n\nThe ashram also boasts a stunning Lord Shiva Fountain, which becomes a mesmerizing sight at night when illuminated with multicolored lights. Additionally, the campus includes well-maintained, three-story restroom (toilet) facilities for men and women, a temple, and lush green lawns dotted with numerous trees, including the sacred Rudraksh tree.\n\nOver time, the area surrounding the ashram has transformed into a bustling, upscale neighborhood with various commercial establishments and showrooms of major brands. Situated at the confluence of Jawalapur, Kankhal, and Haridwar, the ashram remains a peaceful retreat amidst the growing urban landscape.\n\nTo ensure transparency and prevent fraud, the ashram does not offer online booking for accommodations. Visitors are encouraged to make arrangements directly through the ashram's official channels.",

This certainly is one of the major causes of pollution in the holy river Ganga. I don't want to heart anyone's sentiments but we personally need to think for the same and spread awareness to maintain the cleanliness of our own Ganga MAA.

However, the sheer force of water that you can experience at the actual control point is terrifying. Though at Night, we got tons of clear pictures of the entire barrage road, and also, though chilly, it was a surreal experience to see the entire reservoir filled to the brim.\n\nI suggest a must-visit place.

The temple exudes peace and devotion, offering visitors a tranquil atmosphere away from the bustle of the city. Its architecture is striking, with beautifully carved idols, especially of Lord Shiva and various Hindu deities, which add a vibrant and divine charm to the surroundings.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the calm environment and the cleanliness maintained in and around the temple premises. The gentle chants and bhajans playing throughout create a serene experience that's both meditative and welcoming.\n\nWhat keeps it from being a 5-star spot, however, is that it's slightly less known, so some visitors might miss it if they're not guided properly. Also, it can get crowded during festival times, and facilities like parking or shaded resting areas could be better organized.\n\nStill, Bhuma Niketan is a hidden gem in Haridwar-worth a visit for anyone seeking spiritual comfort and a quiet moment of reflection amid the holy vibes of the city.",

There is a river next to this place where you can enjoy throwing stones at water 😁 .\nMake sure to take water , food & snacks with you because you will not find any place near to this place. There is a tea stall but they do not offer much but that tea stall is good. You can buy snacks cold drinks & have a cup of tea there.\nIf you want to go to this place then i would say go when its cloudy weather because it is best to enjoy it when the weather is good. 👍🏼\n& the road is not so good near this place. But you can park you car near & can go by foot. It will take only 5 to 10mins to reach there.",
