Tickets were priced at ₹240 per person. It was quite hot that day, but the short ropeway ride — just a few minutes from the bottom to the hilltop — was comfortable and offered beautiful views.\n\nThe temple itself has a simple and peaceful architecture, which adds to its charm. However, be prepared for long queues at every step, from the ropeway boarding point to the temple entrance and inside the temple premises. Despite the crowd, the overall experience was spiritually uplifting.\n\nThe ropeway is well-managed, and the staff was helpful, but due to the heat and waiting time, it’s a good idea to carry water and maybe visit earlier in the day. Overall, a memorable visit to one of Haridwar’s most sacred spots!"

We went by ropeway to enjoy bird's eye view of Haridwar, Ganda river and  surrounding hills. Early Morning Trekking is also good option to enjoy panaramic view.\n\nYou can either buy combo of Mansa devi and chandi devi temple the only thing is you should be able to reach both temples on the same day if there's no long queues then it's easy. When we went in 2022 combo charges 324 rs per person while only chandi devi temple ticket charges 195 rs per person.\n\nTemple is clean and well maintained. Temple premises contains idols of lord kali ma, sankat mochan hanuman, Maa Annapurna, Santoshi Maa etc. This siddhpeeth is heavy crowded on festive like Navratri and holiday season. There are waiting halls at each levels and quite nice dining cafe inside and children game area to spend sometime. You'll find beautiful dress photography studies at all places in haridwar rishikesh masoorie."

It is one of three such Peethas located in Haridwar, the other two being Mansa Devi Temple and Maya Devi Temple.\n\nGoddess Chandi also known as Chandika is the presiding deity of the temple. The story of the origin of Chandika is as follows: Long time ago, the demon kings Shumbha and Nishumbha had captured the kingdom of the god-king of heaven - Indra and thrown the gods from Swarga (heaven). After intense prayers by the gods, a goddess emerged from Parvati. An exceptionally beautiful woman and amazed by her beauty, Shumbha desired to marry her. On being refused, Shumbha sent his demon chiefs Chanda and Munda to kill her. They were killed by goddess Chamunda who originated out of Chandika's anger. Shumbha and Nishumbha then collectively tried to kill Chandika but were instead slain by the goddess. Thereafter, Chandika is said to have rested for a short while at the top of Neel Parvat and later a temple was built here to testify the legend. Also, the two peaks located in the mountain range are called Shumbha and Nishumbha."

The views from the temple are breathtaking, especially during sunrise. The ropeway (Chandi Devi Udankhatola) is well-organized and makes the journey convenient, especially for elderly visitors. It's about a 5–10 minute ride offering scenic views of the Ganga and surrounding hills. The temple is clean, well-maintained, and has a peaceful vibe. Darshan is usually smooth, but it can get crowded during festivals. A must-visit when in Haridwar"

If you're in a hurry, visiting on a sunny hot day, I would suggest going for the ropeway otherwise trek is also a good option. It has a scenic view but #*BEWARE OF MONKEYS*#\n\nThe temple is quiet and peaceful. Even on a weekend, the atmosphere and vibe is all heavenly and healthy. There won't be any rush if you go in early morning hours and there are plenty of shops where you can buy the \"prasad\" so don't stick on one and move forward. There are no charges for the show keeping and #Beware of pickpockets#\n\nFew steps upward is another temple, if you're going here I'll suggest to visit that one as well. It is also very calm and peaceful\n\nFor the #parking\nThere is no such proper place. U might have to park on the road, near the hill or along the mountains.\n\nFor #ropeway\nThere are plenty of cable cars and hence your number will arrive soon. Even though you book online, you would have to wait and take ur number from here. A counter is present here, you can also buy tickets offline from there. If you are planning to visit mansa devi temple as well, I would suggest u to buy the tickets beforehand, either from this counter or online, cz there the crowd and rush is 🫡\nLast but not the least, don't forget to buy the peda from here, the most loved prasad."

              "reviewText": "Visiting the Maa Chandi Devi Temple in Haridwar is a journey filled with devotion, peace, and divine energy. Situated atop the Neel Parvat on the eastern side of the Ganga River, this temple is one of the most revered Shakti Peethas and a must-visit for anyone coming to Haridwar.\n\nThe experience begins with either a ropeway ride (Chandi Devi Udankhatola) or a scenic uphill trek. The ropeway offers breathtaking views of the city, Ganga River, and lush hills — it feels as if you're slowly ascending toward the divine. Once you reach the top, the calmness of the surroundings and the ringing of temple bells instantly create a spiritual atmosphere.\n\nInside the temple, the idol of Maa Chandi Devi, believed to have been installed by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century, is powerful and awe-inspiring. Devotees offer flowers, coconuts, and prayers with deep devotion. The temple priests are humble and guide visitors respectfully through the rituals.\n\nIt is believed that worshipping here helps one overcome obstacles, fear, and negativity. During Navratri and other special occasions, the temple sees thousands of devotees, yet it still holds a peaceful vibration that touches the heart.\n\nThe view from the temple is equally divine — you can see the majestic flow of the Ganga and the holy city of Haridwar from above. The air feels fresh, and the spiritual energy is high.\n\nIn summary, Maa Chandi Devi Temple is more than a place of worship — it’s a sacred experience of strength, surrender, and divine motherly love. A visit here brings not just blessings, but a deep inner peace. 🌸⛰️🙏"

So one need not leave it near any shop and then be forced to buy stuff from them. There is a coconut breaking area at the back... Otherwise all the pooja stuff we buy is dumped into a box. So avoid buying those small red bags for Rs.100. Darshan shall be quick and one will get ample time to see and pray mata ji. On the way back for ropeway users there is a small cafeteria with snacks at affordable prices.\nNon consent photography for the pure intent of making money is something I dislike.

The temple is dedicated to Goddess Mansa Devi, who is believed to fulfill the wishes of her devotees.\n\nView from Haridwar: You can see the temple clearly from many places in Haridwar, as it sits high above the town. It looks especially beautiful in the early morning or evening.\n\nHow to Reach the Temple:\n\nBy Cable Car (Ropeway):\nYou can walk for about 10–15 minutes from Har Ki Pauri or the main Haridwar area to reach the ticket counter. It’s a short, easy walk through the market. The cable car ride is quick and gives you great views of the town and the Ganga river.\n\nBy Trekking:\nThere is a steep uphill path with around 1,000 steps. It takes about 30–45 minutes to reach the top if you go at a steady pace. The trek is tiring but gives you a peaceful experience through nature.\n\nTip: Carry enough water, wear comfortable shoes, and try to avoid trekking during hot afternoons. There are a few shaded spots to rest along the way, but not many stalls, so be prepared.\n\nView from the Top: Once at the top, you’ll see a beautiful view of Haridwar city and the river Ganga flowing through it. It’s a peaceful and spiritual place, often with cool breezes.\n\nAbout the Temple: Inside the temple are idols of Goddess Mansa Devi in two forms. Devotees often tie threads to a holy tree near the temple, making a wish. When their wish comes true, they come back to untie the thread. You can offer coconuts, flowers, and prasad at the temple.\n\nHistory: The temple was built in the early 1800s by Maharaja Gopal Singh. It is one of the five important pilgrimage spots (Panch Tirth) in Haridwar.\nQuick Tips:\n\nBest time to visit: Early morning or evening (to avoid heat and crowd).\n\nCable car tickets may have long queues during weekends and holidays—go early.\n\nCarry water, snacks, and a cap if you’re trekking.\n\nDress modestly and keep your belongings safe in the crowd."

The premises are spacious enough to accommodate devotees comfortably, and despite the rush, everything was well-managed.\nYou can reach the temple either by ropeway (₹400 per person for a round trip) or by walking. I chose the ropeway and enjoyed the smooth ride with breathtaking views of Haridwar city and the Ganga river. The darshan was well-arranged and did not take too long.\nAfter visiting the temple, I explored Moti Bazar nearby for some shopping and later went to Har Ki Pauri to witness the Ganga Aarti, which made the entire trip complete and memorable. A must-visit place in Haridwar for blessings and peace of mind. 🙏"

The concept is patriotic and educational, with each of its eight floors showcasing different themes—ranging from freedom fighters and revered women of India to saints from various religions and deities from Hindu mythology. The structure itself is impressive, and the views from the top are quite nice.\n\nHowever, I found the overall experience to be just average. While the lift is convenient for reaching higher floors (with a small fee), coming down requires taking the stairs, which may be difficult for elderly visitors. The temple can sometimes get crowded, and the atmosphere, although culturally rich, doesn’t always feel very spiritual. Cleanliness and maintenance were decent, but nothing extraordinary, and there’s little guidance or signage to help visitors fully appreciate the significance of each floor.\n\nIn summary, Bharat Mata Temple is worth a visit for its concept and architecture, especially if you have an interest in Indian history and culture. But don’t expect a deeply spiritual experience or top-notch facilities. Overall, a satisfactory stop in Haridwar, but not a must-see if you’re short on time."

This sacred site holds deep significance in Hindu mythology, marking the place where King Daksha performed his yajna and where Goddess Sati, overcome with grief and devotion, surrendered herself to the sacred fire.\n\nThe temple echoes the divine tale of Lord Shiva’s sorrow, the creation of Virbhadra, and the eternal love between Shiva and Sati — a story of cosmic energy, sacrifice, and spiritual union. Even today, the energy here is palpable — peaceful yet deeply powerful.\n\nAs you walk through the temple’s corridors, you don’t just witness devotion… you feel it.

Other temples are also present but most of them are operated by lalchi pujari who forces bhakts to donate.\n\nTemple flooring is being constructed again,now it looks beautiful but it can be made more beautiful."

              "reviewText": "Daksheshwar Mahadev Temple, commonly known as Daksha Mahadev Temple, is one of the most revered and historically rich temples located in Kankhal, a sacred town near Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, this temple holds immense spiritual and mythological significance, attracting devotees, pilgrims, and history lovers from across the country throughout the year.\n\nThis ancient temple is believed to be built at the very site where King Daksha Prajapati, father of Sati (Goddess Parvati), performed the famous Yajna (sacrifice) that led to the tragic self-immolation of Sati and Lord Shiva's immense grief and rage. According to Hindu mythology, this event is pivotal as it led to the creation of the powerful divine entity, Lord Veerabhadra, and eventually the reunion of Shiva and Sati. The temple thus holds a deep emotional and symbolic significance for followers of Shaivism and Hinduism at large.\n\nThe architecture of Daksheshwar Temple is simple yet elegant. The sanctum sanctorum houses a sacred Shiva Lingam, around which the temple structure has been built. The white walls with golden detailing, red shikhara (spire), and beautifully maintained premises create a serene atmosphere ideal for prayer and reflection. The temple is surrounded by other smaller shrines and a sacred pond, enhancing its spiritual charm.\n\nVisitors appreciate the calmness of the temple complex, despite its popularity. Devotees often engage in Rudra Abhishek and other rituals, which are performed with devotion by the temple priests. During the Maha Shivaratri and Shravan months, the temple witnesses a surge in pilgrims, and the air becomes electrified with chants of “Om Namah Shivaya.”\n\nThe temple management is known for its cleanliness, organized rituals, and informative displays for visitors. Clean washrooms, shoe racks, and shaded waiting areas make the visit comfortable even during peak hours. Adequate security and friendly staff ensure a smooth spiritual experience.\n\nIn addition to its religious significance, the temple is located close to other prominent sites like Sati Kund and Birbhadra Temple, making it part of an enriching spiritual circuit in Haridwar.\n\nConclusion:\nDaksheshwar Mahadev Temple is not just a place of worship but a gateway into the profound mythology and devotion embedded in Hindu tradition. Its sacred atmosphere, historical relevance, and peaceful surroundings make it a must-visit for anyone seeking spiritual solace or insight into India’s ancient heritage."

Just as the stone of Shivling of Pashupatinath temple of Nepal is considered as Paras stone, similarly the stone of Shivling of Haridwar temple is also of Paras stone. After Nepal, Pashupatinath's temple is only in Haridwar. There is not a third temple like these temples in the whole world.  Shivalinga is considered a replica of Nepal's temple in Pashupatinath temple built in Haridwar, on the lines of Pashupatinath temple of Nepal. The status of Pashupatinath Temple in Haridwar is considered as much as the Pashupatinath Temple in Nepal. The virtuous benefit that will be gained from the darshan of Dwadash Jyotirlinga Pashupatinath Mahadev at Kathmandu, the same benefit will be obtained from the Darshan at the Pashupatinath temple located at Shravannath Math in Moti Bazaar, Haridwar."

We get a glimpse of the city view from the ride that lasts barely 2-3 mins. There is a shoe stand just before the entrance of the temple ... So one need not leave it near any shop and then be forced to buy stuff from them. There is a coconut breaking area at the back... Otherwise all the pooja stuff we buy is dumped into a box. So avoid buying those small red bags for Rs.100. Darshan shall be quick and one will get ample time to see and pray mata ji. On the way back for ropeway users there is a small cafeteria with snacks at affordable prices.\nNon consent photography for the pure intent of making money is something I dislike. They should have made this optional."

The concept is patriotic and educational, with each of its eight floors showcasing different themes—ranging from freedom fighters and revered women of India to saints from various religions and deities from Hindu mythology. The structure itself is impressive, and the views from the top are quite nice.\n\nHowever, I found the overall experience to be just average. While the lift is convenient for reaching higher floors (with a small fee), coming down requires taking the stairs, which may be difficult for elderly visitors. The temple can sometimes get crowded, and the atmosphere, although culturally rich, doesn’t always feel very spiritual. Cleanliness and maintenance were decent, but nothing extraordinary, and there’s little guidance or signage to help visitors fully appreciate the significance of each floor.\n\nIn summary, Bharat Mata Temple is worth a visit for its concept and architecture, especially if you have an interest in Indian history and culture. But don’t expect a deeply spiritual experience or top-notch facilities. Overall, a satisfactory stop in Haridwar, but not a must-see if you’re short on time."

Tickets were priced at ₹240 per person. It was quite hot that day, but the short ropeway ride — just a few minutes from the bottom to the hilltop — was comfortable and offered beautiful views.\n\nThe temple itself has a simple and peaceful architecture, which adds to its charm. However, be prepared for long queues at every step, from the ropeway boarding point to the temple entrance and inside the temple premises. Despite the crowd, the overall experience was spiritually uplifting.\n\nThe ropeway is well-managed, and the staff was helpful, but due to the heat and waiting time, it’s a good idea to carry water and maybe visit earlier in the day. Overall, a memorable visit to one of Haridwar’s most sacred spots!"

We went by ropeway to enjoy bird's eye view of Haridwar, Ganda river and  surrounding hills. Early Morning Trekking is also good option to enjoy panaramic view.\n\nYou can either buy combo of Mansa devi and chandi devi temple the only thing is you should be able to reach both temples on the same day if there's no long queues then it's easy. When we went in 2022 combo charges 324 rs per person while only chandi devi temple ticket charges 195 rs per person.\n\nTemple is clean and well maintained. Temple premises contains idols of lord kali ma, sankat mochan hanuman, Maa Annapurna, Santoshi Maa etc. This siddhpeeth is heavy crowded on festive like Navratri and holiday season. There are waiting halls at each levels and quite nice dining cafe inside and children game area to spend sometime. You'll find beautiful dress photography studies at all places in haridwar rishikesh masoorie."

              "reviewText": "Chandi Devi Temple is highly revered by devotees as a Siddh Peetha which is a place of worship where desires get fulfilled. It is one of three such Peethas located in Haridwar, the other two being Mansa Devi Temple and Maya Devi Temple.\n\nGoddess Chandi also known as Chandika is the presiding deity of the temple. The story of the origin of Chandika is as follows: Long time ago, the demon kings Shumbha and Nishumbha had captured the kingdom of the god-king of heaven - Indra and thrown the gods from Swarga (heaven). After intense prayers by the gods, a goddess emerged from Parvati. An exceptionally beautiful woman and amazed by her beauty, Shumbha desired to marry her. On being refused, Shumbha sent his demon chiefs Chanda and Munda to kill her. They were killed by goddess Chamunda who originated out of Chandika's anger. Shumbha and Nishumbha then collectively tried to kill Chandika but were instead slain by the goddess. Thereafter, Chandika is said to have rested for a short while at the top of Neel Parvat and later a temple was built here to testify the legend. Also, the two peaks located in the mountain range are called Shumbha and Nishumbha."

The views from the temple are breathtaking, especially during sunrise. The ropeway (Chandi Devi Udankhatola) is well-organized and makes the journey convenient, especially for elderly visitors. It's about a 5–10 minute ride offering scenic views of the Ganga and surrounding hills. The temple is clean, well-maintained, and has a peaceful vibe. Darshan is usually smooth, but it can get crowded during festivals. A must-visit when in Haridwar"

If you're in a hurry, visiting on a sunny hot day, I would suggest going for the ropeway otherwise trek is also a good option. It has a scenic view but #*BEWARE OF MONKEYS*#\n\nThe temple is quiet and peaceful. Even on a weekend, the atmosphere and vibe is all heavenly and healthy. There won't be any rush if you go in early morning hours and there are plenty of shops where you can buy the \"prasad\" so don't stick on one and move forward. There are no charges for the show keeping and #Beware of pickpockets#\n\nFew steps upward is another temple, if you're going here I'll suggest to visit that one as well. It is also very calm and peaceful\n\nFor the #parking\nThere is no such proper place. U might have to park on the road, near the hill or along the mountains.\n\nFor #ropeway\nThere are plenty of cable cars and hence your number will arrive soon. Even though you book online, you would have to wait and take ur number from here. A counter is present here, you can also buy tickets offline from there. If you are planning to visit mansa devi temple as well, I would suggest u to buy the tickets beforehand, either from this counter or online, cz there the crowd and rush is 🫡\nLast but not the least, don't forget to buy the peda from here, the most loved prasad."

              "reviewText": "Visiting the Maa Chandi Devi Temple in Haridwar is a journey filled with devotion, peace, and divine energy. Situated atop the Neel Parvat on the eastern side of the Ganga River, this temple is one of the most revered Shakti Peethas and a must-visit for anyone coming to Haridwar.\n\nThe experience begins with either a ropeway ride (Chandi Devi Udankhatola) or a scenic uphill trek. The ropeway offers breathtaking views of the city, Ganga River, and lush hills — it feels as if you're slowly ascending toward the divine. Once you reach the top, the calmness of the surroundings and the ringing of temple bells instantly create a spiritual atmosphere.\n\nInside the temple, the idol of Maa Chandi Devi, believed to have been installed by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century, is powerful and awe-inspiring. Devotees offer flowers, coconuts, and prayers with deep devotion. The temple priests are humble and guide visitors respectfully through the rituals.\n\nIt is believed that worshipping here helps one overcome obstacles, fear, and negativity. During Navratri and other special occasions, the temple sees thousands of devotees, yet it still holds a peaceful vibration that touches the heart.\n\nThe view from the temple is equally divine — you can see the majestic flow of the Ganga and the holy city of Haridwar from above. The air feels fresh, and the spiritual energy is high.\n\nIn summary, Maa Chandi Devi Temple is more than a place of worship — it’s a sacred experience of strength, surrender, and divine motherly love. A visit here brings not just blessings, but a deep inner peace. 🌸⛰️🙏"

This sacred site holds deep significance in Hindu mythology, marking the place where King Daksha performed his yajna and where Goddess Sati, overcome with grief and devotion, surrendered herself to the sacred fire.\n\nThe temple echoes the divine tale of Lord Shiva’s sorrow, the creation of Virbhadra, and the eternal love between Shiva and Sati — a story of cosmic energy, sacrifice, and spiritual union. Even today, the energy here is palpable — peaceful yet deeply powerful.\n\nAs you walk through the temple’s corridors, you don’t just witness devotion… you feel it. The gentle chimes of the bells, the fragrance of incense, and the chants in the air transport you to another realm. It’s a place where time slows down, where the heart feels light, and where the spirit quietly bows.\n\nA must-visit for every spiritual traveler, devotee, or seeker of divine peace. Daksheswar Mahadev Temple is not just a destination — it’s a divine moment carved into the heart of Haridwar.\n\nReview by @the_solo_wanderer_\nFor more stories and spiritual travel moments, search me on Instagram. 🌿📸"

Other temples are also present but most of them are operated by lalchi pujari who forces bhakts to donate.\n\nTemple flooring is being constructed again,now it looks beautiful but it can be made more beautiful."

              "reviewText": "Daksheshwar Mahadev Temple, commonly known as Daksha Mahadev Temple, is one of the most revered and historically rich temples located in Kankhal, a sacred town near Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, this temple holds immense spiritual and mythological significance, attracting devotees, pilgrims, and history lovers from across the country throughout the year.\n\nThis ancient temple is believed to be built at the very site where King Daksha Prajapati, father of Sati (Goddess Parvati), performed the famous Yajna (sacrifice) that led to the tragic self-immolation of Sati and Lord Shiva's immense grief and rage. According to Hindu mythology, this event is pivotal as it led to the creation of the powerful divine entity, Lord Veerabhadra, and eventually the reunion of Shiva and Sati. The temple thus holds a deep emotional and symbolic significance for followers of Shaivism and Hinduism at large.\n\nThe architecture of Daksheshwar Temple is simple yet elegant. The sanctum sanctorum houses a sacred Shiva Lingam, around which the temple structure has been built. The white walls with golden detailing, red shikhara (spire), and beautifully maintained premises create a serene atmosphere ideal for prayer and reflection. The temple is surrounded by other smaller shrines and a sacred pond, enhancing its spiritual charm.\n\nVisitors appreciate the calmness of the temple complex, despite its popularity. Devotees often engage in Rudra Abhishek and other rituals, which are performed with devotion by the temple priests. During the Maha Shivaratri and Shravan months, the temple witnesses a surge in pilgrims, and the air becomes electrified with chants of “Om Namah Shivaya.”\n\nThe temple management is known for its cleanliness, organized rituals, and informative displays for visitors. Clean washrooms, shoe racks, and shaded waiting areas make the visit comfortable even during peak hours. Adequate security and friendly staff ensure a smooth spiritual experience.\n\nIn addition to its religious significance, the temple is located close to other prominent sites like Sati Kund and Birbhadra Temple, making it part of an enriching spiritual circuit in Haridwar.\n\nConclusion:\nDaksheshwar Mahadev Temple is not just a place of worship but a gateway into the profound mythology and devotion embedded in Hindu tradition. Its sacred atmosphere, historical relevance, and peaceful surroundings make it a must-visit for anyone seeking spiritual solace or insight into India’s ancient heritage."

The environment was incredibly peaceful and serene, offering us a much-needed break from the hustle of daily life. 🌸 The people there were warm, kind, and spoke with such love and respect—it truly felt like a spiritual home.\nDuring our stay, we participated in Sharamdaan (voluntary service), took part in a sacred Hawan (fire ritual) 🔥, and even received Diksha (spiritual initiation), which made the experience deeply meaningful and memorable. 🙏 Overall, it was a soul-refreshing journey filled with positivity and tranquility. 🌞"

Unheignic rooms or you can say halls.\n3. Poor planning, you have to borrow Blanket and mattress from a central place and carry to your hall.\n4. You can't buy water bottle from 9 PM itself ,u need to fill from water coolers.\n5. No reason to stay here except free of cost , technically u should leave ur respect aside if u want to stay here.\n\nThis place is not for young person who went to enjoy Haridwar, its for those who are only spiritual person.\n\nThere buildings are clean but rooms were very unheignic and filled with  manner less people.\n\nKindly don't take your kids to this worst place, stay safe and take a good Hotel or refer some good and reputed Ashram if you want to live in ashram only."

Witnessing this dedication firsthand is both inspiring and humbling. A visit to Shantikunj is not just a retreat; it's an enriching experience that rejuvenates the mind, body, and soul, leaving you with a renewed sense of purpose and positivity.

Nestled in the foothills of the Shivalik range near Haridwar, this lesser-known gem offers a perfect blend of wilderness, peace, and raw natural beauty. The dense sal forests, sparkling rivers, and vast grasslands create a breathtaking landscape that immediately puts your soul at ease.\n\nOne of the most captivating parts of the park is its rich biodiversity. I was lucky enough to spot elephants, peacocks, deer, and a variety of birds. The sheer thrill of being so close to wildlife in their natural habitat is an experience that stays with you long after you leave. The early morning safari was especially enchanting — mist floating over the riverbed, sunlight piercing through the trees, and the sounds of the forest waking up made it truly unforgettable.\n\nRajaji is also less crowded compared to other national parks, which means you get to enjoy nature without the noise and chaos of too many tourists. It’s the kind of place that reminds you how powerful and peaceful nature can be.\n\nWhether you’re a wildlife lover, a nature photographer, or someone looking to escape city life and reconnect with nature, Rajaji National Park is a must-visit. It’s not just a destination — it’s an experience that fills you with awe and calm."

The temple exudes peace and devotion, offering visitors a tranquil atmosphere away from the bustle of the city. Its architecture is striking, with beautifully carved idols, especially of Lord Shiva and various Hindu deities, which add a vibrant and divine charm to the surroundings.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the calm environment and the cleanliness maintained in and around the temple premises. The gentle chants and bhajans playing throughout create a serene experience that's both meditative and welcoming.\n\nWhat keeps it from being a 5-star spot, however, is that it's slightly less known, so some visitors might miss it if they're not guided properly. Also, it can get crowded during festival times, and facilities like parking or shaded resting areas could be better organized.\n\nStill, Bhuma Niketan is a hidden gem in Haridwar—worth a visit for anyone seeking spiritual comfort and a quiet moment of reflection amid the holy vibes of the city."

We were charged Rs 31 for two mobile cameras. The behaviour of the person at the counter and the staffs here are also not very good.\n\nOverall you can enjoy here as some jhankis are good.

              "reviewText": "Witnessing the Ganga Aarti at Har Ki Pauri in Haridwar is not just an event — it's a heartfelt spiritual experience that touches the soul and stays with you forever. From the moment you arrive at the ghat, you can feel a gentle shift in energy. The soft sound of flowing water, chants in the air, and the glowing evening light all prepare you for something truly divine.\n\nAs the sun begins to set behind the distant hills, the banks of the holy Ganga start to glow with diyas (lamps), marigold flowers, and the anticipation of hundreds of devotees. When the aarti begins, priests dressed in saffron robes raise giant brass lamps high into the sky, moving them gracefully in circular motions. The flames dance with the wind as the sound of conch shells, temple bells, and “Har Har Gange” chants rise together in a powerful chorus.\n\nYou don’t need to be religious to feel the impact. In that moment, as thousands of people fold their hands, close their eyes, or shed tears of devotion, there’s a deep sense of unity, love, and peace that surrounds everyone. It’s as if time slows down, and the only thing that exists is the love of Mother Ganga.\n\nOne of the most touching parts is when devotees release small leaf boats with a diya and flowers into the river. Watching these tiny floating lights drift away on the sacred water, carrying silent prayers and wishes, creates a feeling of inner calm and surrender.\n\nDespite the large crowds, there’s a deep stillness — not on the outside, but inside your heart. Whether you're standing, sitting on the steps, or watching from a boat, it feels like the river is personally speaking to you, healing you with her presence.\n\nIn summary, the Ganga Aarti at Haridwar is a magical blend of sound, light, devotion, and peace. It’s one of the most loving, calming, and soul-nourishing experiences one can have. A place where heaven touches Earth, and the heart feels truly at home. 🌊🕯️❤️🙏\n\nHighly recommended for anyone seeking spiritual connection, peace of mind, or simply the beauty of devotion."

This sacred ritual, performed every evening on the ghats, is not just a ceremony—it is a celebration of devotion, culture, and the timeless bond between people and the holy River Ganga.\n\nAs dusk settles, the steps of the ghat come alive with the glow of countless lamps and the resonant sounds of conch shells, bells, and rhythmic chants. The sight of priests gracefully moving large fire lamps in intricate patterns against the backdrop of the river creates an atmosphere filled with peace and awe.\n\nWhat makes this place so significant is how it symbolizes gratitude to the Ganga, revered as a life-giving mother. People gather from all over India and abroad to witness and participate in this offering of light, which is believed to purify the soul and wash away negativity. Whether you are religious or simply seeking tranquility, the energy here is undeniable and deeply moving.\n\nI recommend arriving early to find a good spot and to absorb the serenity before the crowd gathers. Watching the floating diyas drift away in the current feels like releasing your wishes and burdens into something greater than yourself.\n\nThis is not just a tourist attraction—it is a living tradition that connects generations through faith, devotion, and hope. A must-visit for anyone wishing to experience the spiritual heart of India."

She used her Kangan to build the Kund. Located just 500–800 m. from Haridwar Junction, the temple is surrounded by lush greenery and forest trails, offering a peaceful atmosphere away from the city crowd. Devotees praise the tranquil vibe, especially in the early mornings. The temple is well-maintained, has no entry fee, and puja items are easily available nearby. Photography inside is generally restricted. It’s particularly vibrant during Mahashivratri and the month of Sawan, when devotees flock here for blessings. Some paths through the forest are slightly uneven, which may be challenging for elderlyl or disabled visitors. A unique tradition here is placing layered stone structures (mannat) as a prayer for home-building and fulfillment of personal wishes. Visit is recommended for its spiritual aura, accessibility, and connection to Haridwar’s rich religious traditions.\nToilets and water facilities available.\n\nTimings: morning to evening"

Tucked away in the heart of the akhada, this temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, and its peaceful atmosphere offers a perfect escape from the crowds. The temple is surrounded by lush greenery and has a calming vibe that made my visit feel even more special.\n\nThe temple is relatively small but carries a deep sense of reverence. I was struck by how quiet and calm the place was, despite being in such a historically and spiritually rich part of Haridwar. The peacefulness of the temple, combined with the sound of the river flowing nearby, created a sense of divine tranquility. The architecture of the temple, though simple, is beautiful and exudes a sense of purity and devotion.\n\nOne of the things I loved about the temple is its location within the Niranjani Akhada, which is one of the oldest akhadas in Haridwar. The area around the temple is pristine, and you can feel the spiritual energy of the place. The priests at the temple were welcoming, and the rituals they performed added to the sacred ambiance of the temple. I offered my prayers with a deep sense of peace and felt a connection to Lord Shiva that was truly humbling.\n\nThe serenity of this temple, combined with its historical significance, made it one of the most memorable places I visited during my stay in Haridwar. If you're looking for a quiet, spiritually enriching experience away from the more crowded ghats and temples, the Shri Bilvkeshwar Mahadev Temple at Niranjani Akhada is definitely worth a visit. It's a place where you can reflect, pray, and truly connect with the divine in a peaceful setting."

              "reviewText": "Nestled on the banks of the Ganga Ghat, this ashram is an ideal sanctuary for meditation and spiritual pursuits, offering a serene environment that fosters inner peace and self-discovery. Established in 1944 by Hans Ji Maharaj, the ashram's origins trace back to a profound moment when he witnessed a snake and a mongoose drinking water together at the Ganga Ghat. Inspired by the harmonious energy of the place, he decided to create an ashram here. Today, the sprawling Prem Ashram is managed by Satpal Maharaj Ji and stands as a testament to its founder's vision.\n\nOne of the ashram's highlights is the Govardhan Hall, a massive space dedicated to satsang and meditation. As the largest hall in Asia, it spans 6,000 square meters and features a unique single-span design without supporting columns. Encircled by corridors on all four sides, the hall creates an awe-inspiring sense of vastness, capable of accommodating up to 25,000 people. Stepping inside, one feels as though they have entered a boundless, tranquil space.\n\nAnother notable feature is the sacred Panch Pallav tree, where five different trees—vata, pipal, pakar, mango, and gular—grow together from a single base. The leaves of this ancient tree are considered auspicious and are used in religious rituals. Symbolizing the five senses, the five leaves of Pancha Pallav are placed atop a water vessel during puja, representing the divine feminine energy.\n\nThe ashram also boasts a stunning Lord Shiva Fountain, which becomes a mesmerizing sight at night when illuminated with multicolored lights. Additionally, the campus includes well-maintained, three-story restroom (toilet) facilities for men and women, a temple, and lush green lawns dotted with numerous trees, including the sacred Rudraksh tree.\n\nOver time, the area surrounding the ashram has transformed into a bustling, upscale neighborhood with various commercial establishments and showrooms of major brands. Situated at the confluence of Jawalapur, Kankhal, and Haridwar, the ashram remains a peaceful retreat amidst the growing urban landscape.\n\nTo ensure transparency and prevent fraud, the ashram does not offer online booking for accommodations. Visitors are encouraged to make arrangements directly through the ashram's official channels."

The best part was that we got to visit this at Night, and the experience was altogether different seeing this at Night.\n\nThe reservoir in itself is vast and is also used for hydroelectricity generation. However, the sheer force of water that you can experience at the actual control point is terrifying. Though at Night, we got tons of clear pictures of the entire barrage road, and also, though chilly, it was a surreal experience to see the entire reservoir filled to the brim.\n\nI suggest a must-visit place. And visit the barrage and the control point at Night to have an altogether different experience."

When you go to that place feel the energy, you can surely say that whatever happened and whenever happened it was true. All the Hindu religion stories of God and godess. This place is merely visited by few people. That's why it doesn't have that much facilities and recognition. But it is our duty for keeping alive the things and religion. I really appreciate the effort of panditji , who is doing prayer every day there from past 20 years .\n\nMy only advice is don't see this place as a place but consider it as a temple it will give so much good vibrations and peace in mind . This is the place where Shiva showed that what kind of pain one feel when there loved ones was gone 🙏🏻."

Yesterday I took a bath in har ki paudi but the barricades were so little in depth in the river that we needed to lay on the steps to submerge in water. Also Amrapur ghat has changing rooms for male and females without any cost, however har ki paudi changing room was having a crowd and was taking money."

There is a river next to this place where you can enjoy throwing stones at water 😁 .\nMake sure to take water , food & snacks with you because you will not find any place near to this place. There is a tea stall but they do not offer much but that tea stall is good. You can buy snacks cold drinks & have a cup of tea there.\nIf you want to go to this place then i would say go when its cloudy weather because it is best to enjoy it when the weather is good. 👍🏼\n& the road is not so good near this place. But you can park you car near & can go by foot. It will take only 5 to 10mins to reach there."

The IIT Roorkee(Earlier Roorkee University) at Roorkee is one of the oldest and prestigious institute of learning in the fields of science and engineering. Another university of the district i.e. Gurukul having vast campus is giving traditional educations of its own kind.\nThe followers of Lord Shiva(Har) and followers of Lord Vishnu(Hari) pronounce this place Hardwar and Hardwar respectively as told by some. It is also a point of entry to Dev Bhoomi and Char Dham  (Four main centers of pilgrimage in Uttarakhand) Viz.  Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotri.\n\nLegendary king Bhagirath is said to have brought the river Ganga from heaven to earth in order to provide salvation to his ancestors. It is also said that Haridwar has been sanctified by the presence of three Gods; Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. Lord Vishnu is said to have his foot print on the stone that is set in the upper wall of Har-Ki-Pauri where the Holy Ganga touches it all the times . Devout believers feel that they can go to heaven by getting their salvation after a dip in the sacred Ganga at Haridwar.\n\nHaridwar is also one of the four places; where Kumbh Mela occurs after rotation of every twelve Years and Ardh Kumbh after every six years. It is said that drops of Amrit (Elixir) fell in to the Brahmkund of Har-Ki-Pauri, therefore considered that a dip in the Brahmakund on this particular day which is very auspicious and when Jupiter (Brahaspati) comes to the sign Aquarius (Kumbh) once in every twelve years the Maha Kumbh fair is celebrated at Haridwar.\n\nOn somwati amaawas ,kumbh etc hindu famous religious days, there's a huge gathering.\nTo avoid any hazardous situation police divert the traffic even streetwalkers also diverted to rope defined area,that make you spend little more time on waiting and if you want to go Mansa devi and chandi Mata ( also attached a temple of mata anjana) you have to book your tickets on counter. On above said auspicious day you have to Book them online ( to use ropeway) other wise you can go through pagdandi or walking on road too."

As I stood by the banks of the Ganga, the sight of the river flowing gracefully under the golden rays of the setting sun was mesmerizing. The evening Ganga Aarti was the highlight of my visit. The rhythmic chants of mantras, the sound of temple bells, and the sight of countless lamps floating on the river created an atmosphere of divine tranquility.\n\nI joined the devotees in offering prayers, feeling a sense of connection to something larger than myself. Bathing in the holy river was a unique experience—it was refreshing and spiritually uplifting. Har Ki Pauri not only gave me peace of mind but also a deeper appreciation for the cultural and spiritual heritage of India. It’s a memory I’ll cherish forever."

The city is steeped in culture and tradition and is known for its spiritual significance. The Ganges river flowing through the city is a sight to behold and is considered one of the holiest rivers in India.\n\nThe city has a rich history and is home to numerous ancient temples and shrines. The evening aarti at Har Ki Pauri is a must-see experience that left me in awe. The city also has several markets where you can buy traditional clothes, handicrafts, and souvenirs.\n\nI was impressed with the cleanliness of the city and the efforts taken by the local authorities to maintain it. The locals were friendly and hospitable, and I felt welcomed throughout my stay.\n\nOverall, Haridwar is a great place to visit for anyone looking to experience spirituality, culture, and nature. I would highly recommend a visit to this beautiful city."

It's always full of crowd so try to come on weekdays instead of weekends to these places. After visiting har ki Pauri you can visit Mansa devi temple and chandi devi temple. Known as the Shaktipeeths. You can also visit a temple in kankhal called Daksh prajapati temple in haridwar ( with highly significant religious values these temples are a must visit). I'll recommend you to visit haridwar in the months of oct to Feb because at this time the weather is a bit nice. Otherwise the summers here are as bad as in Delhi."

Though it's our responsibility to maintain the neatness, but some people between us in the name of beliefs leave their inner garments and other holly remains in the holy river Ganga. This certainly is one of the major causes of pollution in the holy river Ganga. I don't want to heart anyone's sentiments but we personally need to think for the same and spread awareness to maintain the cleanliness of our own Ganga MAA. If we maintain the same we can give the same to our future generations . Always think about it before dropping your waste at your holy mother The Ganga's place . Think before dropping waste 🙏🏻"

The food quality was terrible – the bread (roti) was undercooked, and the sabzi was drenched in excessive oil and spices, making it unidentifiable and unpalatable.\n\nWe ordered thalis priced at ₹100 each, but when I requested extra sabzi, they arbitrarily increased the price to ₹120, which was extremely frustrating. My group consisted of six people, and the overall experience was both unpleasant and overpriced.\n\nI do not recommend this place to anyone looking for good food or fair pricing."
