You may also want to spend an overnight here before the cruise or afterwards. (downside is that there is a lot of trash and debris in the water which is disturbing as a “westerner”. There appears to be no effort by the government to require the local operators of the day cruises or the local fisherman to keep the water clean. Vietnam should follow the example of the Philippines in Palawan, where the beautiful waters are treasured, and the scuba diving and snorkeling is phenomenal.)\nWe stayed at the Moon Boutique which is affiliated with Cat Ba Ventures. It's very cute hotel and reasonably priced with a very good breakfast. Cat Ba Ventures will also arrange for your transportation from Hanoi or Ninh Binh/Tam Coc . However, if your budget is a bit higher, consider staying at the 5 star   Perle d'Oriente hotel, which is adjacent to Cat Co 3 beach with a lovely pool, a nice beach, a full pool side bar. Just a note, there is a lot of construction going on by Son world of a huge hotel complex with a man-made beach and yacht Harbour, which commenced in late 2024, and as I understand, it is scheduled to be a five-year project. But if you take the cruise boats, you will not see or be bothered by the construction.(Moon Boutique does look out on the construction. The five star hotel, Perle does not. )",

I was really looking forward to experiencing the view from the top, but unfortunately, the Sun Wheel was closed during our visit.\n\nDespite this, the trip was worthwhile. To reach the Sun Wheel, we took a scenic cable car ride, which was an adventure in itself and offered stunning views of Ha Long Bay. The ticket price was 360,000 VND per adult, and I felt it was reasonable considering the overall experience.\n\nEven though the main attraction was unavailable, we enjoyed exploring the beautifully designed Japanese-style buildings in the area. The architecture adds a unique cultural touch to the park. The Dragon Slide was another highlight, providing a fun and thrilling ride that we thoroughly enjoyed.\n\nI hope to return when the Sun Wheel is operational to complete the experience. Overall, it's a great place to visit for families and anyone looking to enjoy a day out in Ha Long.",

There's two types of Bats  in the area.\nYou then walk the exit path. There's a cafe near end of the path near the road.\nBeers and drinks for sale.\n\nMy taxi driver was waiting for me there and we continued onto the Hospital cave a few minutes away.\n\nNot a big cave, but a good little walk.",

Located in the heart of Ha Long City, the mountain stands as an iconic landmark, attracting visitors with its breathtaking views and cultural heritage.\n\nThe mountain, with an elevation of 200 meters, is not particularly high, but it provides a magnificent panoramic view of Ha Long Bay, which is known for its emerald waters and thousands of limestone islands. From the summit, visitors can enjoy a 360-degree view of the bay, the bustling city, and nearby islands, making it an ideal spot for photography and sightseeing. The view from Bái Thơ Mountain is especially mesmerizing at sunset, when the sky is painted with shades of orange and pink, creating a peaceful and scenic atmosphere.\n\nIn addition to its natural beauty, Bái Thơ Mountain is also historically significant. At the top of the mountain, there is an ancient stone inscription with the words “Bái Thơ,” which means “poetry offering,” created by King Le Thanh Tong in 1468. The inscription honors the natural beauty of Ha Long Bay and the poetic spirit of the region. It is said that the king visited the mountain to enjoy the view and compose poetry, which further adds to the cultural appeal of the site.\n\nFor those visiting Ha Long, climbing Bái Thơ Mountain is a must-do activity. The hike is relatively easy and takes around 20-30 minutes, making it accessible to most visitors. The trail is lined with trees and steps that lead to the top, where the magnificent view awaits. Whether you're a nature lover, a photography enthusiast, or a history buff, Bái Thơ Mountain offers an unforgettable experience.",

If you are taking a grab, you can put the address as 86 Hang Noi. Do note that 106 Hang Noi is not directly facing the main street. So after you alight, look for a lady and say the word ‘mountain'. She will respond to you if she is the right person and she will ask you to walk through the alley and she will meet you at the behind of her house.\n\nYou will enter her house and climb the stairs to the third floor which leads to the outside gate. The lady will continue to guide you and you will see a long ladder which you will need to move it together with her and put it against the rock wall. She then asked for money, and I directly gave VND100K and she accepted it.\n\nThe most challenging part is to climb the ladder and hike towards the left direction until you see a proper walk path with wooden fence. Then just continue the path until to the top of the mountain. I spent around 20 minutes from climbing the ladder to the summit, which was considerably fast.\n\nRest assured that the view is totally rewarding and you will be amazed by the scenery!",

I used the house number 86. Most of the trail has a good path made of concrete but no maintenance, I think they made that to reach the internet antenna up on the viewpoint. After entering house number 86 I paid 100.000 and started my walk. The beginning is hard as you can see in the first video. You have to use the ladder and then climb the mountain slightly. This part is dangerous, but after that, it's okay. I recommend you do the trail early in the mourning because there is no shade at all and it was so hot up there",
