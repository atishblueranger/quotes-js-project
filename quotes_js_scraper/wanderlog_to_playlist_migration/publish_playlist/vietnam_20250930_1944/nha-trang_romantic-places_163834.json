Not amazing but as expected and decent enough.\n\nWhat made the night was the music (a DJ starts around 8:30pm) and our server, Vy Long, who was the sweetest, happiest, loveliest person.

However, the show was inside the restaurant, so I couldn't watch it. I found out that the staff didn't understand English and just guided me to an empty seat.\nThe show lasted about 10 minutes, and it was just a fire show that you can see from the street.\nAfter the show, they played some exciting music and the customers danced together.\nThe absurd thing was that when I returned to my original beachside seat after watching the show, my drink had been taken away and other people had taken my seat.\nIf you like dancing, it might be better to just go to another club.\nIf you want to have a drink in a nice atmosphere on the beach, I recommend another restaurant nearby.",

The views over Nha Trang from up there are incredible, offering a panoramic perspective of the city skyline, mountains, and coast.\n\nAbout halfway up, you'll find a serene reclining Buddha statue, carved into the hillside, surrounded by carved monk figures. It's a calm spot to take a break before continuing making your way down.\n\nThere is also a bell tower as well to see.",

Entrance is free, but you might meet people trying to sell incense or ask for donations - just ignore them if you're not interested, no pressure.\n\nTip: Dress respectfully (no short shorts or tank tops), and try to visit early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat and crowds.
