The banana lassi (requested for no sugar) was easily the best lassi I've ever had. They use edible straws made from flour.\n\nWe also had Saigon beer, passionfruit/dragonfruit juice, claypot fried rice (shrimps and fish - barracuda) and homemade spinach ricotta ravioli in pesto sauce (a little bland). Fried rice was not bad. About 10 to 20 usd for main courses.\n\nThere's also western food and appetizers on the menu. We were able to get the staff to drop us off at our resort (1km away) on his motorbike for approximately 1 usd.",
