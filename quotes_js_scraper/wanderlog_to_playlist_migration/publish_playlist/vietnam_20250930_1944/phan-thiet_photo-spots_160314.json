However, the visit is fairly quick unless you opt for activities like riding an ATV or taking a jeep tour-these are fun but can get pricey. Besides these activities, there isn't much else to do in the area. It's a great experience to try at least once for the views and adventure, but it's not something I'd feel the need to revisit. Worth a visit if you're in the area, though!",

While they don't have the same vast expanse or major attractions, they still provide a peaceful escape and a chance to enjoy the unique desert landscape.\n\nThe reddish hue of the sand is striking and makes for great photo opportunities, especially around sunrise and sunset when the light casts beautiful shadows across the dunes. There are some activities available, like sandboarding, though they're less commercialized and not as intense as at the White Sand Dunes. If you're looking for a more relaxed, short stop to explore the dunes or capture a few photos, it's a nice place to visit.\n\nThat said, there's not much else to do here beyond walking around and taking in the view, so it's best for those who want a quiet break rather than a full-day adventure. If you're in the area and have some spare time, the Red Sand Dunes are worth a brief visit, but don't expect the same level of excitement or scale as their White counterparts.",

The place is not well maintained and while it was momentarily interesting to see the towers it is really nothing if you have been to other parts of SEA and seen those structures. The fee is silly and idk why they would charge for such an “attraction” it clearly does not go back into the park maintenance.",
