The things I liked about this mall is that it was modern, clean, a lot of brands to choose from,bigger but less crowded than Saigon Centre and Vincom Mall. My son and I spent time at the play place in the basement while my wife enjoyed shopping for local vietnamese goods at EMart, a big supermarket with a good and varied selection of products. There were barely any tourists when we went here. I highly recommend this place for travellers who want to do grocery shopping (shopping for local stuff to bring back home) while having a lot of popular brand options. A lot of dining options also.",

Tucked mostly underground, it's got air-con, a calmer pace, some decent shops, and even a billiard club hidden inside. Worth a look if you want a break from the street chaos and maybe a sneaky game of pool.",
