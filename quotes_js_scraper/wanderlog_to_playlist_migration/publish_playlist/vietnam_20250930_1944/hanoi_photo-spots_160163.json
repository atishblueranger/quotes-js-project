Each courtyard and gate tells a story, and you can truly feel the historical significance of the place.\nBriefly, the Temple of Literature was established in 1070 as Vietnam's first national university. It was dedicated to Confucius, scholars, and sages, and for centuries, it served as a center of learning and intellectual pursuit for the country's elite. Walking through its hallowed halls, you can almost imagine the students and scholars who once studied there, striving for knowledge and wisdom.\nOverall, it's a wonderfully preserved site that offers a fascinating glimpse into Vietnam's past.

The architecture is stunning, with its tall, red pagoda tower and detailed statues. I especially enjoyed walking around the garden area and seeing the Bodhi tree that was gifted from India. It's a great place to escape the city noise for a bit and take in some cultural and historical beauty. Make sure to dress modestly and go early in the morning for a quieter experience.",

The places we visited before Vietnam were pretty strict with dress-code and it was our first pagoda to visit. There were ladies renting the cover for legs which also looked nice for pictures and we also didn't want to disregard local rules. But then we saw so many other people with shorts and no one running after those people. So maybe visitors were lucky or they don't chase after tourists with shorts. The rent wasn't cheap btw 🥲😁  The pagoda itself looked beautiful and they was a nice green garden around it. It's also free of charge and well maintained. I would recommend to come here during the sunset",

It's a small complex so 30 mins was enough to go around and see everything. The weather was too hot when we came, so it made our visit a bit challenging as it was so hot. Especially this wasn't our first stop in city tour, it was right in the middle, so a lot of energy has been gone after going around. So maybe avoid to come during middle of the day, either to go early or afternoon. Overall, it was nice to see and learn about this place.",

Please remember not to use your phone and take pictures in certain areas because they can take them away.

Still, it was worth every moment to witness such an important piece of Vietnamese history. Entry is free, but there are strict rules in place to maintain the sanctity of the site.\nPhotography and videography are strictly prohibited inside the mausoleum. Visitors must dress modestly - clothing that reveals shoulders or knees is not allowed. Silence and respectful behavior are expected throughout the visit.\nThis is not just a tourist spot but a place of deep national pride for Vietnam.

It's a small complex so 30 mins was enough to go around and see everything. The weather was too hot when we came, so it made our visit a bit challenging as it was so hot. Especially this wasn't our first stop in city tour, it was right in the middle, so a lot of energy has been gone after going around. So maybe avoid to come during middle of the day, either to go early or afternoon. Overall, it was nice to see and learn about this place.",

Don't forget to try the famous egg coffee at one of the many cozy cafés.\n\nShopping in the Old Quarter is also an adventure. Markets and small shops sell everything from souvenirs to handmade crafts at bargain prices. Be ready to practice your bargaining skills!\n\nDespite the hustle and bustle, Hanoi Old Quarter has a unique charm.

I'm not sure if this was normal but strongly suspect it was because of International Womens Day  (March 8/2025). The compound was extensive and there were one of two buildings with exhibits. Lots of grounds to view - a few gardens (though nothing in bloom at the time we visited). There are large grassed areas, places to sit, a bit of a children's play area and even a small coffee shop and a photo shop if you'd like to dress up in traditional garb. We met lots of friendly faces and had a lot of fun on what turned out to be a very special and colourful day.",

A simple walk through tells the story of different ethnicities of Vietnam and their culture, in depth enough to get a grasp. I was surprised at the vast groups of ethnicities. It unfolds the lives of people living by the coast, river, plains, and highlands. Allocate 1,5 hours here if you are the type that reads everything.\n\nThe kite building host exhibitions of Southeast Asia, it varies from time to time. When I was there, there was an exhibition of textiles & costumes. Very interesting, allocate +/- an hour here.\n\nThe outdoor area consists of real ethnic houses, down to the decor, tools, and display of a typical dwelling. The original craftsman was invited to build the houses on site, each one telling a story. The story of things in the main building comes to life in the outdoor exhibition. Allocate 1,5 hours here.\n\nAll in all, if you can only do 1 museum in Hanoi, pick this one! Definitely worth your time.",

To our pleasant surprise, we were seated immediately on a Saturday night. The food exceeded expectations, with standout dishes including a well-prepared pasta, a flavorful chicken entrée, and a perfectly cooked pork dish.\n\nThe bar area is visually stunning, with beautiful ceiling ornaments adding to the ambiance. A live band provided entertainment, and while the music was excellent, the volume was overwhelming, particularly in the seating area adjacent to the bar. The excessively loud sound left my ears ringing after a prolonged stay.",

There will be store employees trying to pull you to their shops but just say no if you don't want to. Personally I think all shops are about the same. We're not there for the food anyway although we still had to order something to sit.\n\nIt gets crowded closer to the train time so it's better if you can make a reservation. I couldn't find the phone number of the coffee shop though, that's why I arrived early. Food prices are on the pricier side and there will be peddlers trying to sell their goods while you're sitting.

We barely managed to grab seats for the next night's 8:00 PM show-and when we arrived, it was packed wall to wall, sold out again. And for good reason.\n\nThe show was simply amazing.\n\nMy first experience was 20 years ago, and sitting there again brought me right back-I felt like a kid. This time, I had the joy of watching my son experience it for the first time, and he was moved beyond words. It's not just a show-it's a blend of culture, history, music, and magic on water.\n\nOne minor (but notable) issue: the seating is a bit low, so depending on where you're seated, the head of the person in front of you might block part of the view. But honestly, even that couldn't take away from the performance.\n\nIt's easy to see why it's sold out so often.\nAbsolutely recommended. I could watch it again and again.",

The quirky stairs going up were definitely a highlight! ✨Lights go dim from 6pm, hence, the bar ambience. That message on the wall is strikingly beautiful,  \"It's always better when we're together.\" A must-visit hidden gem on Bao Khanh street!",

After entering the apartment, just turn left and head up the stairs to the second or third floor.\n\nThe space has a cozy, hidden charm and is great for chilling. However, I'm giving it slightly less than 5 stars because the place felt a bit warm - the air-conditioning wasn't cool enough during our visit. Also, the seating was a bit uncomfortable, possibly because we're quite tall and the seats felt a little too compact.\n\nThat said, their coffee and cakes are definitely worth trying, especially their signature salted coffee - a must!\n\nOverall, a nice experience with great flavors, but the atmosphere could be improved for better comfort.",

I was particularly moved by the vibrant folk art and the powerful wartime pieces, which blend patriotism with creativity.\nThe layout is chronological, but a bit perplexing to navigate through, hence, I'd recommend the audio guide for deeper insights and clarity, as some English descriptions are limited. My only gripe was the occasional crowd of photo-takers, which slightly distracted from the serene atmosphere, however, it's a common thing for such sights. Still, it's a must-visit for art lovers and anyone curious about Vietnam's history. Entry is only 40,000 VND, and the gift shop has unique souvenirs. Highly recommend!",
