The view is amazing from up there and we enjoyed it a lot. It's not too hot at all, since they have fans everywhere.\n\nWe also had dinner there and chose the two people menu with Shrimps, pork ribs, bread, steamed rice, morning glory with garlic and two passionfruit desserts. Everything was great, but the dessert was a bit too sweet for our taste. The service was good, but having a bit more privacy and some distance would have been great.\n\nWe really loved the magician there and also we won a vietnamese hat with the logo of Skylight. 🤭\n\nAll in all it was a good evening and everything was well managed. ♡\n\nBUT: They charge extra taxes on the prices and we ended up paying 120k more for our meal.

Of the three waterfalls that make up the group, the bottom one is the most crowded but also the easiest to reach–but even it is still a half-hour trek through the bright green jungle to get there and be able to dip your toes in the cool water pool. Waterfalls 2 and 3 require a harder climb using stone steps and large boulders and pushing through thicker forest.",

Bred for export to the Soviet Union, the program was abandoned during the American War, and now the mischievous primates can be spotted almost everywhere you go. Besides seeing what monkey business they get up to, visitors can lounge on the beach and take in the peaceful ambiance, or go swimming, kayaking, jet-skiing, or scuba diving in the surrounding waters.",

We were there for half an hour, gave the monkeys some food and left as quickly as possible.\nTha monkeys aggressive between themselves but we didn't experience it on humans.

At sunrise, the golden rays gently pour over the sea, casting shimmering reflections that sparkle like countless dancing gems upon the waves. The water here is so clear that one can easily see the soft ripples of sand beneath, and its gentle waves create a soothing rhythm that invites visitors to relax and unwind. The surrounding air is fresh and lightly scented with the ocean breeze, while the horizon blends seamlessly into the deep blue sky, forming a breathtaking panorama. Along the coastline, palm trees sway gracefully in the wind, adding a touch of tropical charm. Whether you are strolling barefoot on the warm sand, taking a refreshing swim, or simply sitting and watching the sunset paint the sky in shades of gold and crimson, Nha Trang Beach offers an experience of pure beauty and serenity – a perfect harmony between nature's elegance and peaceful escape.",
