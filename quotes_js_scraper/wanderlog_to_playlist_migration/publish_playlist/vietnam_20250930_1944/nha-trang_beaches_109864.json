If you want peace and quiet, Bai Dai Beach might be a better option–it's full of locals, which means the beach and its surroundings aren't as well developed.",

However, the show was inside the restaurant, so I couldn't watch it. I found out that the staff didn't understand English and just guided me to an empty seat.\nThe show lasted about 10 minutes, and it was just a fire show that you can see from the street.\nAfter the show, they played some exciting music and the customers danced together.\nThe absurd thing was that when I returned to my original beachside seat after watching the show, my drink had been taken away and other people had taken my seat.\nIf you like dancing, it might be better to just go to another club.\nIf you want to have a drink in a nice atmosphere on the beach, I recommend another restaurant nearby.",

You could also hear less traffic noise than from the main beach in Nha Trang. The water was very shallow, super warm and without waves - it was just like sitting in a bathtub. There are some rocks and fish around, which makes it entertaining enough to go around with a snorkel mask. Perfect for kids.\nThere were no stands by the beach, but there are some sun loungers and plenty of cafés and restaurants across the street. If you're staying in central Nha Trang, it's definitely worth getting a Grab and go there instead of Nha Trang beach.",
