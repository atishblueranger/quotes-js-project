Within an hour, while we were at a nearby shop, the place got Crowded-seems like we picked the perfect timing! 📸 Got some good clicks too!\n\nI had visited this beach ages ago, but it has Developed significantly since then. Noticed some great improvements, like a ramp for the physically challenged ♿ and an increase in the number of shops. The beach is full of vibrant energy, with plenty of activities and games to enjoy. 🏖️🎈\n\nCompared to Marina & Pattinapakkam, this place has a unique charm for me-maybe a personal connection, who knows? 😄 Besant Nagar Beach feels quieter, cleaner, and well-organized, making it perfect for a Peaceful walk, reading, or simply enjoying the waves. 🌊✨ Definitely a must-visit spot!",
