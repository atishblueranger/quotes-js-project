I feel that the temple needs so more cleaning and hygiene due to huge crowd and will work better than now. I really felt blessed to get a chance to visit these places.\n\nThe only thing I found about the priests, they are always into rush in any famous temples. Even though less crowd they always ask devotees to go out as fast as they can. But if you see positive sides then one of the best temple to visit in Chennai. Lovely.",

Here's what stood out:\n\nHistory & Architecture\n\nOne of Chennai's oldest surviving temples, originally built by the Pallavas in the 6th–8th century, then expanded by the Cholas and later Vijayanagara kings  .\n\nA proud Divya Desam, praised in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham by the Alvars  .\n\nFeatures classic Dravidian structure: towering Raja Gopuram, ornate stone pillars, 36-pillared mandapam, and detailed carvings  .\n\nMultiple Forms of Perumal\n\nCentral shrine houses Lord Parthasarathy (Krishna–Charioteer of Arjuna), unique with a moustache (“Meesai Perumal”) and holding only a conch (no discus), believed to bear Bheeshma's arrow scars from Kurukshetra  .\n\nOther shrines honor Yoga Narasimha, Rama, Gajendra Varadaraja, and Ranganatha, making it a revered Panchamurthi sthalam  .\n\nMeesai Perumal & Variants\n\nThe moustached form is an iconic visual; during certain days of Vaikunta Ekadasi, he's shown without a moustache, symbolizing humility  .\n\nThe temple also includes a distinct shrine for Yoga Narasimha, with its own entrance and dhvajastambha  .\nPrasadam\n\nThe Ven Pongal served here is particularly sweet and rich, made with extra ghee and cashews-believed to soothe the deity's arrow wounds  .\n\nCommon temple prasadam like Puliyodarai is also loved by devotees  .\n\nLocation & Atmosphere\n\nSituated in the heart of Triplicane, just a few minutes from Marina Beach, yet it feels like a peaceful oasis  .\n\nReal devotees comment on its positive aura, dedicated priests, and well-maintained grounds  .\n\nFestivals & Events\n\nMajor celebrations include Chittirai Brahmotsavam, Vaikunta Ekadasi, and the Masi (February–March) Theppam (float festival) in the temple tank  .\n\nThe annual Ramanujar festival is significant-legend says his father performed a Putrakameshti yagna here and received the blessing that Ramanuja would be born  .\n\nSummary\n\nA divine blend of ancient architecture, living tradition, and deep Vaishnava devotion-this temple is high on my list for anyone seeking spiritual depth or historical richness in Chennai. The sight of Meesai Perumal, the serene tank, and the lusciously sweet prasadam make it unforgettable.",

The sanctum feels powerful and unhurried; priests are courteous and guide first-timers through simple offerings. The campus is clean, prasadam counters run smoothly (pongal/laddu are worth it), and there's shade to sit for a few quiet minutes even on busy days. It's also a popular wedding temple, so you may catch a mandapam buzzing with ceremonies.\n\nGood to know: Tuesdays, Fridays, Kanda Sashti, and Thai Poosam draw big crowds-come early morning or late evening. Footwear counters are organized; photography is fine in outer prakarams (not inside the sanctum). Parking is tight around Arcot Road-Vadapalani Metro station is the easiest way in. Dress modestly and carry small change/UPI for archana tickets and prasadam.\n\nTip: If you prefer a quicker darshan, ask at the counter for the special-entry line.\nSecret tip: Arrive just before opening time-the first deeparadhanai (“suprabhatham” vibe) is the calmest, most beautiful moment, with the Vel lit by lamps and hardly any crowd.",

The gopuram is stunning with its intricate carvings – you can spend quite some time just admiring the details.

Parking can be a bit tricky, and the crowd is usually heavy, but that's expected at such a famous temple.

Devotees still seek blessings for health.\n\nSage Valmiki and other saints like Bharadwaja, Markandeya, and even the celestial Kamadhenu cow are all connected to this temple's lore  .\n\nArchitecture & Deity\n\nThe temple sits on about 1 acre, with two grand seven-tiered gopurams on East Coast Road and West Tank Street  .\n\nInside, a large mandapam with 36 intricately carved pillars houses the serene Somaskanda form of Shiva, alongside shrines for Tripurasundari (Parvati), Murugan, Ganesha, Dakshinamurthy, and others  .\n\nThe self-manifested (swayambhu) Shiva Linga, called Palvannanathar, stands facing west - a rarity among Shiva temples  .\n\nVisitor Experience\n\nThe temple exudes a calm, spiritual energy. Devotees come here seeking healing and peace, often taking ritual dips in its sacred tank  .\n\nIt hosts six daily rituals and twelve annual festivals, including Panguni Brahmotsavam and Maha Shivaratri  .\n\nAfter a recent ₹75 lakh renovation (2020 Kumbhabhishekam), the temple is beautifully maintained and vibrant  .\n\nIn summary, the Marundeeswarar Temple is far more than a historic structure - it feels like a living sanctuary of spiritual healing and timeless devotion. A definitive must-visit on Chennai's temple trail.\n\nA unique feature of the temple is the sacred tree (Sthala Vriksham) under which Lord Shiva is believed to have given darshan. The space around the tree feels calm and spiritually powerful - a perfect spot to sit peacefully for a few minutes.\n\nThe temple is spacious, well-maintained, and offers a serene experience, especially on weekdays. It's a great place to escape from the hustle of the city while still being in the heart of Chennai.\n\nNote: There are a few stray dogs outside the temple premises. They usually stay around the entrance and can be aggressive at times - it's best to stay cautious and avoid approaching them.\n\nA must-visit for anyone seeking a spiritually enriching experience in Chennai.\n\nParking of vechile is available with a cost of 50",

The overall experience was enjoyable, and the place is well-maintained.\n\nHowever, since April is quite hot, the walking paths get really exhausting due to the high temperatures. It would be great if more trees and shaded plant areas are added along the way to give some relief from the sun.\n\nOne concern I noticed was a deer that had escaped its enclosure and was eating human-discarded food. While it was surprising to see, it also shows the need for better monitoring and care in the deer section to avoid any risks to the animals or visitors.\n\nOn the positive side, they support both cash and QR code payments, which is very convenient in this digital age. But one important suggestion: there was no clear notice or signage informing visitors that online payment can be done directly through a QR code without standing in the ticket queue. I waited in a long queue only to be told at the counter to scan and book online via WhatsApp chatbot. This needs to be highlighted with proper boards at the entrance to save visitors' time.\n\nDespite these small issues, the zoo offers a rich and diverse experience and is definitely worth visiting. A few improvements can make it even better!",

Located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, it holds a special place in the hearts of cricket fans due to its deep-rooted legacy and passionate crowd.\n\nStepping into Chepauk feels like walking into a temple of cricket. The energy is electric, especially during IPL matches when the yellow sea of Chennai Super Kings fans brings the stadium to life. The roar from the stands when MS Dhoni steps onto the field is truly spine-tingling and something every cricket enthusiast should experience at least once.\n\nThe view from the stands is excellent, with well-maintained seating and a layout that gives most spectators a clear view of the action. The upgraded infrastructure and new pavilions have improved the overall comfort and experience. Facilities like clean restrooms, food courts, and accessible entry points make it convenient for families and fans of all ages.\n\nWhat sets Chepauk apart is the knowledgeable crowd. Fans here appreciate the game beyond just boundaries and sixes - even a well-bowled dot ball or a defensive stroke can earn applause. This respect for the sport creates a unique and respectful atmosphere that resonates with players and fans alike.\n\nThe stadium is also easily accessible by public transport and offers a great location close to Marina Beach, making the visit even more enjoyable.\n\nIn short, Chepauk Stadium is not just a place to watch cricket - it's a place to feel cricket. For any die-hard fan, witnessing a match here is nothing short of a dream. The legacy, passion, and pure love for the game make it one of the best stadiums in the country.",

The atmosphere is absolutely unbeatable - the sea of yellow, the deafening cheers for Dhoni, and the pure cricket fever make it a one-of-a-kind experience for any fan.\n\nThe stadium itself has a historic vibe and decent facilities. Seating was comfortable enough, though certain stands can get quite hot during day matches. The crowd energy is what makes the place come alive - every boundary and wicket is celebrated like a festival.\n\nEntry and exit were managed decently, though it gets a bit chaotic with the crowd. Snacks and refreshments are available, but a bit pricey and the queues can be long.\n\nOverall, if you're a CSK fan or just love live cricket, this stadium should definitely be on your bucket list. Watching a match here is not just about the game - it's about being part of the yellow army!",

Of course,we could see a part of presentations in 3 hours. Full viewing needs almost full day.\nOnly thing, which I found at the ticket counter missing was online mode of payment. In this age of technology, museum management must review mode of online payment at reservation counter in place of cash payment for purchase of tickets",

Good exhibits from the colonial times including guns, cannons, uniforms, medals, coins, ceramics, maps, documents, paintings etc. Gives a glimpse into the history of Chennai and development of British rule in the region. Must visit for history and heritage enthusiasts.\n\nCons - the only way to get tickets is by online method at the entry of the museum which is quite tedious. Very few fans are inside the museum so it's terrible on a hot day.",

Upon entering, you're greeted by a striking marble statue of Lord Cornwallis-an iconic landmark and conversation starter.\n\nGround floor features armaments and porcelain; an upper floor displays portraits, medals, and coins; and the top floor houses the Indian national flag hoisted after Independence.\n\nWell-preserved galleries, especially the detailed craftsmanship on artifacts and colonial ephemera.\n\nThe museum can feel quite warm, especially on hot days. Fans are few and spaced out.\n\nEntry ticket can be booked through online link, via QR codes only, at the entrance.\n\nSince the museum lies within a government compound, anticipate police screening. Carry a valid ID. Open from 9 AM to 5 PM. Entry Fee: Rs.20 per head. Bring water, there are limited facilities inside. St Mary's Church (“Westminster Abbey of the East”) is worth exploring too.\n\nNice place to spend 1 to 2 hours with family. Children might enjoy the artifact's.\n\nFree Car parking available across the main road.",

We asked for preponement (actual timing was 11 AM to 2 PM) and it was  agreed upon by the owner. We completed the shoot according to the stipulated time and we were in the process of packing and  moving out. Meanwhile, the young couple out of curiosity and interest it seems that they took additional photos which was objected  by the female employee (we agree to her objection) who was coordinating the bookings on behalf of the owner. As reported by my son her body language and words / sentences used was very very harsh and ferocious. She behaved in the same manner with me also. She should  give respect to elders at-least. Other persons (Watchman, owner's driver and the person who was selling buttermilk) who witnessed her rude behaviour even outside the Secret Garden premises had said that was her usual  behaviour. While dealing with the public especially with the youngsters who are bound to be curious during the happy moments of photo shoot, she can  be polite to some extent. No doubt that the owner with whom we were in communication over mobile phone was very decent, polite  and cooperative.  Sir, as the owner, you have the full rights to speak anything to the client.  Sir, please ask her to report any such incidents to you and you can decide as to whether to return the caution deposit to the client or deduct it for extended shoot. Sir, i know that after having read this review you will say this is a false review. But, truth always prevails. Sir, we understand that you are dealing with a business wherein different types of visitors will be there and it's difficult for you to handle them. Finally, my only request to you is that the female employee who does possess a good managerial and administrative skills may be asked to be little polite and not be very ferocious please.......Regards.",

The mosque complex also includes a Dargah dedicated to Imam Hussain (Raziyallahu Anhu), the revered grandson of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, further enhancing its spiritual significance for the Shia community.\n\nThe Thousand Lights Mosque is not only a vibrant center for daily worship but also a focal point during Muharram, when thousands gather to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Hussain. The atmosphere during these observances is solemn, with the mosque beautifully lit and filled with the sounds of prayer and reflection.\n\nVisitors are welcomed, provided they dress modestly and observe the decorum expected in a place of worship. The mosque's central location makes it easily accessible, and it remains open from early morning until late evening, inviting both devotees and those interested in its history and architecture to experience its unique ambiance.\n\nBeyond its religious functions, the mosque is a symbol of Chennai's pluralistic heritage and serves as a reminder of the city's deep-rooted connections to diverse faiths and traditions. Its enduring presence, historical roots, and architectural grandeur make it a must-visit for anyone seeking to understand the cultural and spiritual fabric of Chennai.",

I went this Sunday first of all I parked my car outside of the parking zone still the parking person forcefully took parking charges. On entering I paid 25/- ticket but inside nothing I saw just a simple small lake and few trees.  Very small and half of the portion of the park is closed and not accessible from the public. It's only for daily walkers. The security guards were weird and was giving weird look making me uncomfortable. On asking anything they were very rude. Overall below average experience.",
