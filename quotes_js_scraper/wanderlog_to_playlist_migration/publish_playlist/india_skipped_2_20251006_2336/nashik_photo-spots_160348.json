The lush greenery, expansive vineyard views, and the calm, open-air vibe gave it a serene, vacation-like feel. It's the kind of place where time slows down just enough for you to soak in the moment.\n\nI spent most of my time strolling around the vineyard and clicking pictures-the landscape is picture-perfect, especially around sunset when the golden light hits the vines. The architecture of the property feels rustic yet classy, and there are enough cozy spots to sit and relax for hours. Their café and restaurant spaces have a relaxed charm, offering a variety of vegetarian options, though I wish there were more innovative dishes on the menu for non-drinkers like me. Still, the wood-fired pizza and cheese platter were surprisingly good.\n\nWhat I liked most was how the place isn't just about wine-it's about the experience. Even without a wine-tasting session, there was enough to explore and enjoy. The gift shop is great for souvenirs, and the staff were courteous and didn't pressure us into taking any tours we weren't interested in.\n\nOverall, Sula was more about the peaceful escape, the vibes, and the views than the wine itself for me. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a scenic day trip or a calm weekend break-even if you're not into wine, there's still something beautiful to take away from the experience.",

The grounds are well-maintained, and the overall atmosphere feels upscale and curated for a pleasant day out.\n\nThat said, it's very expensive for what you get. Wine tastings, food, and even basic experiences are priced at a premium, and not always justified by the quality. It feels more commercial than authentic at times, catering heavily to tourists rather than wine enthusiasts.\n\nWorth a visit for the views and photos, but go in knowing it's more about the setting than the wine itself.",

Many people think Sula is only about wine tasting, but that's not true - there's plenty to enjoy without touching a wine glass.\n\nThe lush green vineyards 🌿, open landscapes 🏞️, and calm ambience ✨ make it an excellent spot for a relaxing getaway. The property is very well-maintained, with lots of open spaces to walk around, click photos 📸🌸, and simply enjoy the fresh air. It truly feels like an escape from the busy city life.\n\nThe entry fee is ₹1000 per person on weekends and ₹600 on weekdays 💰. The good part is that you get coupons of the same value, which can be redeemed inside at the restaurant or café 🍴. We used ours for food, and while the taste and quality were excellent 😋, the food items are a little on the expensive side 💸. Still, it balances out since the entry fee coupons cover a good part of the cost.\n\nSince we didn't opt for wine tasting, our time was spent exploring the vineyard, enjoying the atmosphere, and relaxing over a family meal. The only drawback was that service can be a bit slow ⏳, and yes, prices are slightly premium.\n\nIn short: Even if you don't drink, Sula is still a beautiful, family-friendly place to visit - peaceful, scenic, and a memorable outing! 💫😊",

The moment I entered the temple premises, I felt a sense of peace and calm that's hard to put into words. The temple is beautifully built from black stone - simple yet incredibly powerful in its presence. It's not just a place of worship, but a space that holds centuries of history and emotion.\n\nWhat stood out most to me was how well-maintained the temple is, and how serene the environment felt even though it's located in a bustling part of the city. There's a deep spiritual energy here, and taking a few quiet moments inside the sanctum really helped me reconnect with myself.\n\nI also found the historical significance of the temple very moving - especially its role in Dr. B.R. Ambedkar's movement. It made me reflect on the layers of culture and social change that places like this carry silently through time.\n\nI took some photos around the temple - the stone carvings and temple facade are absolutely worth capturing. The best time to visit is early morning or around sunset when the light makes everything look even more beautiful.\n\nWhether you're visiting Nashik for religious reasons, sightseeing, or just exploring, I highly recommend spending some time at Kala Ram Temple. It's not just a tourist spot - it's a place that stays with you.",

Tucked away in a scenic setting, this waterfall is a serene and beautiful spot, perfect for a day trip with family or friends. The sound of cascading water, surrounded by lush greenery and rocky terrain, creates a peaceful atmosphere that instantly relaxes you.\n\nThe waterfall isn't too commercialized, which makes it feel more untouched and authentic. The natural pool at the base is clear and inviting, though safety is important if you plan to step into the water. I recommend visiting during or just after the monsoon season (July–September) when the falls are at their fullest and most dramatic.\n\nThere's also a small temple nearby, adding a spiritual touch to the visit. The area is relatively clean, and locals are friendly and helpful. Just make sure to carry your own snacks and water, as amenities are minimal.\n\nIf you're a nature lover or looking for a peaceful retreat away from city life, Someshwar Waterfall is definitely worth a visit!",

The entire trail was surrounded by lush greenery and cool mist, making the uphill climb pleasant and scenic. The ancient Buddhist caves are well-preserved and offer a glimpse into rich historical art and architecture. Monsoon adds a magical charm to the place with clouds floating around and panoramic views of Nashik city from the top. The steps are well-maintained, but can get slippery-so wear good shoes. Perfect spot for a peaceful trek, history, and nature. Highly recommend visiting during the rainy season for the best experience.",

Boy what a view that time...\n\nThe Gangapur dam was clearly visible and the place was very well maintained at that time.\n\nThe food was good, the service was premium and the atmosphere was nostalgic.\n\nBUT NOW!!\n\nDo not visit. It's the restaurant where you have to take coupon of Rs. 500/- per person to enter the area. It's redeemable at the restaurant or at the wine store but not refundable.\n\nSo if 6 friends are visiting, make sure the minimum bill needs to be Rs. 3000/-.\n\nSo, only people willing to spend that much money are welcome.\n\nOkay, now if you go inside...u should be awed by awesome service, awesome view, awesome food and everything awesome...\n\nBut no... The ladies washroom was filled with so many mosquitos...even government toilets  taking 2 rupees per person are safer and cleaner than this one. We were so afraid of those mosquitos as it's basic hygiene in this season of dengue and mosquito borne diseases.\n\nNow let's come to the view - ALL GONE. A huge construction of some resort has started and that one lies exactly in between the York view and the Gangapur dam. You cannot see a single inch of the dam while dining in.\n\nNow, let me tell you about the wine - The wine glasses used were not the one which should be...same glasses for red and white wine. Glasses were not chilled... They were awesome 6 years back...Wine was okay too...just okay. Nothing special...pricey and they didn't even serve a year old one.\n\nFood...ouch..\n\nCheckout the picture of Cheese Bombs starter plate... We clicked the picture before eating a single bomb ...lol 😆\n\nThe quantity is too too less...the cost is a lot. Even my mom gives more cheese bombs to each one in the family than this...and this is the full plate 😬😬\n\nWe ordered Paneer Makhani and roti...the vegetable was bland and tasted stale.\n\nAnd finally, the staff. It was casual and they poured wine like we pour water in the glass when studying for next day exam ... So meaningless. Wine is an emotion. At YORK... It's an empty emotion now for sure.\n\nDo not visit. There is nothing fine dine about this place now.\n\nRest in peace the amazing view.\n\nP.S. We asked how did this happen to York! And came to know it was acquired by Sula. Oh oh. Hence, the Rs. 500/- per person entry fees. Unhygienic washrooms. Unskilled labour. And such a degraded experience.\n\nP.S. 2 - Don't go with the pics I clicked. I tried to find a good angle as was trying to photograph well with my new phone 😁",
