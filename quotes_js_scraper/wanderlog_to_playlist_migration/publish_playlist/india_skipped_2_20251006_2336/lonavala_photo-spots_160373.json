There's also a small gaushala (cow shelter), and the overall atmosphere is calm and spiritual.\n\nA great plus is the temple's accommodation and dining facilities. The bhojanalaya serves simple, sattvic food that adds to the spiritual vibe of the place. It's an ideal spot not just for devotees, but also for anyone looking for a peaceful getaway amidst nature.",

Located atop a small hill near Lonavala, the temple is a sacred place for devotees, especially from the Koli community. Be ready for a moderate climb of around 200 steps, but the divine energy and scenic view at the top make it totally worth it.\n\nAdjacent to the temple are the ancient Karla Caves-Buddhist rock-cut caves dating back over 2000 years. The main chaitya (prayer hall) with its massive pillars and carved details is breathtaking. The whole area offers a peaceful and spiritual experience with a touch of history and nature.\n\nTips:\n\nVisit early in the morning to avoid crowds and heat.\n\nWear comfortable shoes.\n\nLocal food and refreshments are available at the base.\n\nA must-visit spot if you're in or around Lonavala!",

Sunset Cafe isn't fancy , it's more like a small kitchen in the clouds , but that's exactly what makes it special.\n\nIt's run by a single vendor, who's super kind and humble. There's a nice little garden outside, and the view of the foggy clouds and hills is absolutely magical. The peaceful vibe makes it perfect for a quiet tea break with family.\n\nI tried the corn pizza and sandwiches, both were tasty, and the coffee was warm and comforting in the rain. The fog rolling through the hills while sipping tea or coffee is something you just have to experience.\n\nHighly recommend stopping here if you want a break from the highway rush and a moment of peace with nature.",
