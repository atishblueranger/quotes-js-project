They will tell you that the gate charges parking fees, but in reality, the parking is only ₹10. The place is not very far from the gate, so you can also go by walking.\n\nAs for inside, you won't find drinking water there, so it's better to carry your own water bottle. The entry ticket is just ₹20. There isn't much special inside the palace. However, it's a nice place for couples-it's peaceful, surrounded by forest, and you can sit quietly and talk.\n\nBut if you are going with your family, then you won't really find it that enjoyable.",

The hall was originally named \"King Edward Hall\" in honour of the British monarch, King Edward VII. However, after India gained independence in 1947, it was renamed \"Gandhi Hall\". It is an impressive example of Indo-Gothic architecture, blending intricate carvings and ornate details with red sandstone, giving it a beautiful warm hue and white marble.",

Yeshwant Rao Holkar II renamed the hall as Gandhi Hall in honor of Mahatma Gandhi after a gap of 50 years. The recent renovation under the ‘Smart City Indore' project in 2021 restored the hall to its original grandeur.
