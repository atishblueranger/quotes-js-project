It was busy but the inside was roomy so we didn't feel cramped. For drinks, we ordered the pineapple blush and iced latte. Wouldn't recommend the pineapple blush as it was just sour with no sweetness. The iced latte was creamy with a good milk to coffee ratio. For food, we ordered Rosa's Eggs and an Eggs Royal. Rosa's Eggs portion was smaller than expected and the toast on the bottom was extremely hard to cut into and bite. It was really good with the hollandaise sauce from the Eggs Royal. Eggs Royal was great as well but the salmon was a bit too fishy. Overall, the service was decent. Food took about 15 mins to come to the table and staff was attentive.",
