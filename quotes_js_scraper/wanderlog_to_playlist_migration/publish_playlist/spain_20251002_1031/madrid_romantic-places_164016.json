I experienced the beauty of this park in winter as well as during the summer. This is truly a beautiful park, a calm escape from the bustling city. The sculpture gardens, the rose garden, the great pond is all worth visiting when in this park. Feeding the ducks and turtles in the pond was so amazing. The entire park filled with its greenery is beyond imagination. The most amazing part is that this park was opened to public in 1868 and until this day, the beauty of this park has remained intact! Such a well-maintained park, giving you a feeling of ease, comfort and happiness. I missed boating in December but made it a point to rent a boat for boating this time when I was there. Such an amazing experience to row a boat on your own. It is a great place for families and friends to meet up and have a quiet picnic there with their loved ones. I highly recommend visiting this park when in Madrid!",

The whole pitch was easily visible. There were individual screens along the ceiling and the stand was covered and heated. The atmosphere was phenomenal because Real closed the roof to help make more noise, but after Saka and Martinelli made the remontada more like a remont-nada, the closed roof only amplified the singing of the Gunners fans and the crying from Los Blancos.\n\nBragging aside, Real Madrid is the most successful club in the world and this is an adequate home to host the team and the fans. Beautifully designed. Clean. Way to access. Comfortable. Loud and proud!\nIt's walkable from the city center (about an hour walking from Sol) and easily  reachable by metro.\nIf you can't watch a game, make sure to visit for a tour. It's iconic!",

            "text": "Truly, truly world class. The exterior of the building was incredible and very imposing. Unique architectural concept.\n\nUpon walking inside, you are immediately confronted with the modern and contemporary art section. These sections were wonderful and it is very interesting for a museum to have both classical and modern / contemporary artworks all in one building. The film installations were quite bizarre to say the least (in a good way), but told an interesting story that I liked.\n\nHowever, once you ascend up the staircases, you get to enjoy all the art before the modern and contemporary.\n\nMy favorite section was about an artist called Nestor de la Torre, an artist from the Canary Islands I did not know about before. His paintings spanned many large rooms, and they were all incredible. The Reína Sofía did a great job on exhibiting many of this little-known artist's works. I must say that his paintings have a quality that upon viewing, you know immediately it is this artist's style. Truly unique, one of a kind. I do not know why he is not represented more in the art scene of today.\n\nOf course, there are the other very famous rooms, which display works by Picasso and Dalí. The singular most infamous work on display is Picasso's Guernica, which tells the suffering of war. Some of Dalí's most famous paintings are there as well\n\nI recommend checking out the sketches that Picasso made of the weeping ladies he has displayed in Guernica to get a clear sense of the level of preparation that Picasso did.\n\nOverall, a fantastic museum and great experience. I think this museum - in my opinion - has one of the most intriguing collections of modern art I have seen thus far in all my travels to world class museums. 🖼️\n\nPlease go here if you are in Madrid. The Reína Sofía also has a wonderful, amazing store filled with so many great books that I wanted to take back with me! 😊",

I suppose this is only on weekends. I'm not sure on weekdays. So we decided to take the opportunity and we waited in line ( not that long and good thing everybody seated yet in line along those short walls in front of entrance).\nOnce ur inside the museum is pretty big with 4 stories. Currently, the 3rd floor is closed. 1st floor and 4th floor has temporary exhibition, so i believe they often update new one. But the main highlight was Pablo Picasso, Guernica' famous painting at 2nd floor room no.205. You can also find Dali painting as well. Most of the people are on the 2nd floor. Rest its pretty much contemporary arts and paintings, which my wife is not a big fan of it. At some points, yes, it is hard to understand and appreciate the beauty, although the 19th/20th century artists do express themselves.\nOverall, it was good to see at least one famous Picasso painting. The building layout is a bit confusing, though. Since it was free, it was not bad. Spend 1 and half.",

As far as I can tell, only a small part of it is original - it's been heavily restored. I think its fame is mostly due to a bandwagon effect. The surrounding park is much nicer - ideal for walking and relaxing. To enter, you have to scan the QR code shown in the picture and wait about 20 minutes. They only allow 15 people inside at a time.

The park is over 1,700 hectares in size and is the largest park in Madrid.\n\nThe park was originally a royal hunting estate and was created by King Philip II in the 16th century - from which the park gets its name. The estate was originally used primarily by Spanish royalty for leisure and was only opened to the public in 1931. This was due to the transition of Spain from a monarchy to a new Republican government which aimed to modernize Spain and break from class privilege and divide.\n\nToday the park features some spacious and beautiful forests and gardens and rolling hills, it is a great spot to take a break from busy city life and go for a walk. Due to the quantity of hills there are a lot of points from which visitors can appreciate panoramic views to the rest of the park and even back over to the city skyline. There are a lot of cycling options available too including a covered cycleway. There are other curiosities to find in the park too such as remaining Spanish Civil War bunkers and the Valdeza Aqueduct.\n\nLago (lake) is a great spot for a picnic or for eating at one of the several lakeside cafes and is a nice entry point to visit the park. Metro access is available by the Lago station on line 10 of the Madrid Metro. Casa de Campo also boasts the Madrid Parque de Atracciones and the Zoo Aquarium de Madrid.",

There's a couple small fountains all around (some didn't seem to be operating though), a pond in the middle of the garden, statues surrounding the whole area (up the stairs, around the pond, etc) but suprisingly not a ton of flowers around and more just bushes and trees. The whole area does seem well taken care of as well.\n\nThere's also stairs surrounding the garden that you'll either have to go down to reach the garden or up after looking around but is definitely worth taking time to take pictures or selfies as it's a very nice view from atop. There are a ton of other attractions around as well such as Plaza de España, Templo de Debod, Palacio Real de Madrid, Puerta de San Vicente, and way more worth seeing.",

From the flamenco dancer to the instrumentalists, everyone seems to have a deep understanding of their craft and it shows through the performance! I would recommend arriving at least 15-10 minutes before to get your free drink of choice and as well as having a higher chance of getting seats facing directly opposite the stage rather than having a side view. The cave is located downstairs which you will be lead to by the staff.  After everyone is seated, the show starts on the dot and a staff member will explain the history of Flamenco both in English and Spanish. Then the performances begin with solo performances and group performances interchangeably. The show goes on for an hour and it truly is a wonder to watch! Although it may not be for everyone as some parts can be repetitive or not as interesting, I do recommend seeing this show if you are interested in live performances and the arts in general!\n\nMy personal favorite performer when I watched was the female flamenco dancer. She has to be aware and in control of the movement of the dress, her facial expressions, her hands, her feet, her shoes, and especially her balance throughout her performance. Seeing it all together is truly a wonder!",

The venue is extremely cozy, which some may find charming, but be prepared for very limited personal space-seating is quite tight and up close.\n\nThe show included a complimentary drink, and I opted for the sangria. It was refreshing, a nice touch to start the evening. As for the performance itself, the musicians were talented and clearly passionate, but the pacing of the show felt a bit drawn out to me. About halfway through, I found my attention starting to drift. It may have simply been a matter of personal taste, as many others in the audience appeared fully engaged and enthusiastic.\n\nIf you're curious about flamenco and appreciate an up-close setting, this could still be worth checking out. Just keep in mind that the experience leans traditional and may not captivate everyone from start to finish.",

Steeped in 300 years of history, this Madrid institution is a must-visit, and I highly recommend diving into its fascinating story before you go. From the moment you step inside, the old-world charm envelops you, blending elegance with a warm, welcoming atmosphere that feels like a step back in time.\nThe service is nothing short of fine dining excellence. Our waiter was attentive, friendly, and made the experience feel personal yet polished. Menus are available in English if needed, ensuring accessibility without sacrificing authenticity. The atmosphere is further enhanced by the delightful dioramas displayed in the restaurant's windows-whimsical and intriguing, they add a unique touch to the experience.\nNow, the food. The garlic soup with egg and ham was a revelation-rich, flavorful, and so satisfying that I'm already craving it again. The cod was impeccably fresh, cooked to perfection with a delicate balance of textures and flavors. But the star of the show, as this restaurant is renowned for, is the suckling pig. The meat was melt-in-your-mouth tender, bursting with flavor, and crowned with perfectly crisp skin that's worth the visit alone. For dessert, the cheesecake was divine-creamy, indulgent, and the ideal finale to an unforgettable meal.\nDon't miss the wine cellar downstairs, a treasure trove housing vintages older than your great-grandmother, adding to the restaurant's storied allure. This is more than a meal; it's a cultural and culinary experience that you simply cannot skip while in Madrid. Book a table, soak in the history, and savor every bite-you won't regret it.",

Could barely see anything between all the tables in front and waiters and children constantly walking back and forth. Of what we could see was the backs of the dancers, but sounded nice. The couple next to us complained and got better seats - not offered for us. The couple who got put next to us got sick of the bad food and not being able to see anything and left half way.
