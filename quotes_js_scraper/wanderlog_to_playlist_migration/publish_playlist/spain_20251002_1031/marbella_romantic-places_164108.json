Presentation of both Very poor, sausage slithers in a bowl with no real taste, b pudding was nice again severed in a small bowl. No Presentation at all. We ordered the chicken with cheese and tomato top. When it arrived, it looked like a pizza. (See photo) The chicken was well cooked, but the excess cheese, tomato puree & ham topping were far too much. We ordered roast vegetables again in a small bowl, very oilly and not tender. Overall, it was a disappointing meal for us. Our friends enjoyed their stake meals. Presentation 4/10 food 4/10  atmosphere 4/10 as stuck in corner of balcony overlooking a barron alotment.\nPuddings 10/10 wine 🍷 😋 👌",

The entire dining experience was decent with a variety of a la carte dishes to choose from.\n\nThe dry aged entrecôte was my favorite dish and I had it accompanied by some mashed potatoes. Both were incredible and definitely worth the visit.\n\nWhile the atmosphere was peaceful, it was a bit too quiet and awkward at times, since there were no other visitors besides my table during my visit. That said, I suggest booking at a later hour when most of the other visitors start to arrive.",

I've been here once before a few years ago and had mentioned that the steak knives weren't very sharp - and sadly, nothing's changed. Trying to cut through a Tomahawk steak with a blunt knife isn't much fun. Might actually bring my own next time!\n\nI asked for the steak medium, but it came out rare and got cold fast. Staff were friendly, but no one came around during the meal to check if we wanted more bread, butter, or drinks, which was a bit disappointing.\n\nOne nice touch though - the hostess brought my wife some flowers for Mother's Day. That was sweet and definitely appreciated. Overall though, the whole experience felt pretty average.",

From the moment you step in, you're greeted with breathtaking views of the Mediterranean-waves gently crashing, the golden sunset painting the sky, and the soft melody of live music setting the perfect mood. It's an atmosphere that effortlessly blends sophistication with relaxation.\n\nService? It's good-not mind-blowing, but efficient and polite. The real magic, however, lies in the food. Every bite is pure indulgence. From the freshest seafood to perfectly cooked meats, the menu caters to every taste, ensuring that no one leaves unsatisfied. Each dish is prepared with precision, balancing flavors that melt in your mouth.\n\nIs it cheap? Absolutely not. But class and quality come at a price, and here, it's worth every cent. This isn't just a meal-it's an experience. An elegant, mouthwatering, can't-stop-thinking-about-it kind of experience.\n\nIf you're looking for a place that delivers on all fronts-views, ambiance, service, and most importantly, exquisite cuisine-Sea Grill is it. Utter perfection. The kind of place where, by the end of the night, you're practically licking your fingers, wondering why life can't always taste this good.",

It was made from the best parts of the tuna and you can really tell. The octopus noodles with black ink had a strong rich taste and looked cool too. The hippo ice cream dessert was fun and tasted like something from childhood. This is the second restaurant we try by chef Dani Garcia and he didn't disappoint. Big salute to the chef.",

Then we moved into the chef's kitchen where you stand at an island and are presented with another set of appetizers. They were mushroom themed with plenty of shaved truffle varieties. Also a unique part of the experience as this happens before you are seated at your actual table. The courses and pairings are served at well timed intervals. Positives: filling meal, amuse bouche was 5 or 6 bites, dishes really intimated art and were delicious, wine pairing had a wide range of Spanish varietals. Cons: Upon being seated we told the server of a shrimp allergy and he repeated each 3 subsequent visits to the table that this should've been communicated prior; we understood this and said we could've gone the a la carte route if modifications could not be made. Instead the chefs were able to accommodate, but the server kept reiterating how we should've let them know - reinforcing a feeling of guilt. After the bread course and crumbs were quite literally all over the table, the restaurant did not remove these (despite having asked) until before the dessert course. Attentiveness seemed to taper off toward the end of the meal as the staff could be seen chatting amongst themselves. Overall the food was incredible, presentation was stunning, and it's worth a visit.",
