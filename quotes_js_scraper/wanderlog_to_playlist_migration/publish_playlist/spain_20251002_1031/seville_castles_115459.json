It's close enough to Seville to day trip but also has great tapas bars (Buenos Aires, my favourite). The Castillo is attractive and free to enter and there's a striking church above. Both sunset and sunrise are striking from this vantage point. Come and explore.... Check out the dragon bridge and the park below.",

It was truly beautiful.\n\nWe highly recommend wearing comfortable shoes, as there's a lot of walking involved. Don't forget to bring water and take your time - there are plenty of perfect spots for photos and relaxing strolls.\n\nIt's essential to buy tickets well in advance. We purchased ours two weeks before our visit and could only get the last available time slot. After booking, you have to wait for a confirmation email.\n\nMake sure to get your tickets long before your trip, as entrance is strictly based on the time stated on your ticket - no early entries were allowed for anyone.\nWe didn't had a guide and were able to enjoy the garden.\n\nTo fully enjoy the visit, it's a good idea to prepare children ahead of time and let them know there will be quite a bit of walking involved 😄👍",

We went over the August Bank holiday weekend and it was BUSY - as you'd expect, not to mention incredibly hot, both inside and out.  Take a fan and plenty of water as the place is large!  There is a cafe but we didn't use it.  There seems to be a lot of recommendations about booking in advance, but we booked at about 10pm on Saturday night and got tickets for 11.30 the next morning.  Maybe we were lucky or August is quieter... I don't know.  Book to be on the safe side - I'd recommend using a local operator if poss - prices range from £50 each to £17pp which we opted for!  That said, this didn't include a tour / audio. There were QR codes but didn't try those.  Nothing is in English either - just an observation.  Inside, the palace consisted of a series of interconnected rooms, mainly empty (no furniture) with the exception of beautiful mosaic floors, ceilings, walls, tapestries and plaster work, open courtyards, you get the idea.  Gardens were gorgeous.  Evidently, you can see the Royal bedrooms but have to book far in advance of your visit.",
