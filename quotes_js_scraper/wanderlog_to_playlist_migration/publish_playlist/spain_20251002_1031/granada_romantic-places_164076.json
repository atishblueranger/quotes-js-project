It felt like I have found my refuge, truly, after baking and melting in the sun I am not used to as much, for past few days. So much greenery that I was astonished by it and curious how it is maintained over this challenging hot summer period. It's almost magical to keep this to such a standard on a daily basis and it takes lots of sweat and blood of people and lots of water, so I have truly appreciated it! It was so good to habe found a place where I could walk barefoot, to watch ducks in a pond and see lotus flowers and to lie in a green green grass next to the tree. As a very welcomed bonus, there was a local school of kids sketching around the pond when I was taking my sketchbook out, too, so really Ive had a beautiful morning. I will have to come back for getting some more inspiration from the famous poet Lorca as it was really more down to earth trip today",

Undoubtedly, one of the highlights were the peacocks strolling about. Not much signage in English, or at all, but there was some information displayed about the origins of this park (as a tribute to the Christian martyrs capture under Islamic rule and invasions).",

Cant wait to go again & try the massages as well.  Photos not allowed inside the baths themselves which i appreciate as there was complete peace and serenity, completely forgot concept of time & took “mental” photos,, its absolutely a must see to believe ❤️\n\nSpecial thanks to wonderful Maria who welcomed us.\nAlso highly recommend visiting their store afterwards as they got some amazing 100% natural products!

Getting instructions as to what to do and the order was a little overwhelming for first timers. Plus they are trying to be quiet,  so it was hard to hear the instructions. One real negative thing for me is they wouldn't allow water shoes or flip flops of any kind. You had to go bare foot. They is definite no no in my book. We were told to put on our bathing suit and meet just inside the pool area and get further directions. Another staff member then told us the what each pool was (hot, medium and cold) and pointed out the steam room. Please shower first and after any time you use the steam room. We were surprised that you didn't have to wear a bathing cap for your hair. By the time she explained the layout, and we showered, the massage guy came over and said it was time for our massage.  We were able to drink some tea while waiting outside the room. I wish we were told to smell the 4 different oil scents that you can choose from. They were on the wall. We were just asked which scent we wanted, but we then noticed the samples so we quickly smelled them and made our choice. The massage was average. 45 minutes. Relaxing, both masseuses were very nice and cautious about keeping body parts covered. After we went back to the pools and had our soak. Trying each one at least once. Very nice atmosphere. The changing room gets crowded with multiple lockers on top of each other, not much room to change. Individual stations are set up to do your hair, makeup and that was really nice. We felt the price was reasonable enough for what you got. No photos inside as we locked our phones in the locker.",

I wish that when we come, they should sit down and tell us what to do or prepare before going inside. Because I thought I would get a massage first and then go for a hot bath or sauna later. So I come straight with my short without no one and wait until I see people wear swimming suit. So that's not good for people come the first time.\n\nThe massage is okay, with 30 minutes you can't feel enough wow or relax for your body. You should choose the oil you want before they massage( that's in the tea area)\nI wish they should tell everyone to take a bath first and then massage in the end. Because if you massage and then you come to the bath with oil so that's not good too.\nFrom my perspective, they need to train all your staff about the system so it will not be uncomfortable for customers to use their services because the price is not cheap.\n\nOtherwise, that is the good place to relax, floating your soul in the hot bath. They have great decorations, 👍quiet, and the water drop make you connect with nature.\nThey have towels, shower 🚿 area, dry hair area.",

The gardens are well taken care of and very cute, it would be the perfect place for a special event like a small wedding or celebration. When I asked they said you can come and visit the garden from 6-8pm and did not have to pay a fee to enjoy them (i believe that's the hours they are open to the public, otherwise if you're staying there you can come in and out as you wish). It is also a great place to have a photo shoot, I saw a photographer there with a model. There are a lot of cute spots for pictures. I believe the gardens are part of a hotel, which I did not see so my review is based on the gardens and views. It would be great if they had a café open to be able to enjoy a drink there.",

Truly a hidden gem in Granada, this restaurant offers one of the best scenic backdrops for a romantic dining experience. The food lives up to the setting-our tuna was perfectly prepared, showcasing exceptional freshness, and the wine selection was equally impressive. Don't miss the fried eggplant, a local specialty that adds a delightful touch to the meal. The combination of the stunning view, delicious food, and fine wine makes it well worth the price. Whether for a cozy lunch or an intimate dinner, it's the perfect spot to create unforgettable memories.",

We arrived close to closing time, yet the staff welcomed us warmly and treated us with incredible attentiveness and care throughout the evening. The service truly stood out: gracious, patient, and thoughtful in every detail.\n\nThe food was equally impressive. We started with the sampler of assorted cheeses and jams, which was beautifully presented and full of rich, balanced flavors. The lamb tagine was a standout dish -- tender, aromatic, and deeply satisfying. The salmon was perfectly cooked, fresh, and flavorful, rounding out a well-curated and memorable meal.\n\nCombined with its romantic setting and scenic views over the Alhambra and the city, Carmen de Aben Humeya offers not just dinner, but an experience. It's the kind of place where you feel taken care of, where the food and atmosphere linger in your memory long after you've left. Highly recommended for a special night in Granada.",

Instead of telling us frankly that balcony seats have all been reserved weeks before our dinner date, their WhatsApp replies simply stopped when we asked to confirm balcony seating. No answer on phone calls and no call back despite many msgs left and attempts to get in touch. Nevertheless, the food here is better than average despite the disappointment in seating arrangement after flying 21hours to get here.",

Our lovely waitress was Sara. Also fantastic that smoking is banned on the terrace, as well. That way you can enjoy a relaxed meal even outside. Thanks for the lovely time❤️",

We came here after hearing they serve their own barrel vermouth it was nice, though not drastically different from others I've tried. The place was lively and bustling during lunchtime. You can eat standing at the bar or seated at one of the side tables. The complimentary tapa that came with the first drink (I think it was paella) was really tasty. They don't serve another free tapa if you order food with your second drink. Overall, a fun and enjoyable stop!",

If you're looking to try something new the fried eggplant with honey was surprisingly amazing and I do t eat eggplant back home. Service was also great they are very welcoming and efficient.

I'll be honest, my husband and I visited Huerta de San Vicente because we had time to kill in Granada, before our train back to Madrid. It is not something we'd heard of in advance or knew much about. But the park was lovely and the tickets were relatively cheap.\n\nThe process was to buy a ticket from the gift shop desk and wait for the museum, aka, the house to be opened. There were 2 other couples, and then the museum curator.\n\nThe curator was incredibly gracious to repeat her spiel of each room in English after first running through it in Spanish. The house is stories and we went through maybe 5 rooms and it was an interesting slice of history, but probably more interesting if you knew of the poet Federico Garcia Lorca and the time period. But it was not a horrible way to spend less than an hour. There was a Picasso sketch, well-preserved furniture, and other pleasant artwork.",

Try the cod with apple - it is not sweet but rather hearty and rich. The omelette with cod and shrimp was another favorite of ours. Finish with the warm chocolate cake for a sumptuous experience from beginning to end. I'm shocked this place wasn't packed, it deserves to be.
