The jungle area was quite interesting since you have a feeling you are in South America. There are additional options for exploring the park, but we didn't do it (as it was charged additionally). There is also a cafe for refreshment. There wasn't a queue at the entrance, but we bought our tickets a day in advance, via online (there was a discount available). This can be a good family day if you are going with kids. There are also playgrounds inside the park. I would recommend it!",

It's steep and a bit of incline.\n\nLook for a kiosk sign with an I. It has a map in Spanish but easy to follow. The map is pertinent to the bottom floor of the castle. Lots of storyboards in  multiple languages, including English.\n\nThere's also a historical timetable of the city that is equally interesting, along with maps.\n\nWashrooms are available throughout that are quite clean. Be sure to bring water as it can very warm walking the multiple floors. FYI- no place to sit where the sun is out, so come prepared!\n\nHighly recommend a visit to the castle!",

If you are an EU citizen you can also go there between some hours that are listed at the entrance to get a free ticket. I suggest you look into it before you go, so you don't have to pay for the ticket. Otherwise it was very pretty the view is amazing and the palace is really interesting. We just walked around the place and we needed 45 minutes so i think it would take longer if we had an audio guide.",

Near the service area, waiters rushing in/out near me. It was unbelievably hot. And I am general on the cool side feeling always cold. I asked for table change but there weren't any. To give you an idea about how hot it was, ice melted in my glass within minutes. One of the waitresses was kind enough to open nearby window so some breeze can come in..\n\nThe restaurant has several dining areas, one of them is the picture perfect courtyard, the rest do not have the same ambiance. I was disappointed about seating choice but nevertheless decided to go ahead and try the menu ..\n\nI'm genuinely shocked to read all the reviews here ! Wondering if my day was a fluke and just bad day for the kitchen. As it was really busy.\nI went with the 4 course tasting menu:\n\nTo start off, the presentation is actually lovely and superb but the taste was not there..\nThe appetizers were too salty with nothing special to remember. You can't taste the various elements in a dish. The bread was something you can easily make at home..I actually wanted to leave at that point…\n\nNow the main course, seabass was actually good and I really enjoyed the dish, but I generally think sea bass is a good fish to cook with, you can never go wrong with it. It also goes well with a lot of elements ..\nThe wagyu beef was poorly done. I did like the idea of truffle churros and sides. The sauces are actually poorly made. Too salty and at beginners level.\nI do believe the pastry chef saved the day, the dessert was really good, hence the three star. I am not a dessert person so if something wows me then it's legit..\n\nPeople in comments wondering about Michelin star. The restaurant needs to be consistent to receive any form of designation. It was a busy night, I get it. But if staff feel overwhelmed to serve a large number maybe cut down on the number of tables to serve better quality.\n\nOverall I wish the owner all the best but there are several key factors to be attended to. This is not what I expected considering the prices and reviews ..",

Clean.\n- Staff generally friendly and helpful.\n- Food is generally alright. Breakfast buffet is decent but not amazing. Food needs to be replenished faster, and staff should check plates etc. are clean - one of the buffet plates I picked up had an egg stain on the back of it.\n- Great to have access to tennis courts and golf.\n- Rooms are nice and a decent size.\n- Unfortunately, the kitchen served a chicken burger to my partner that was raw in the centre - never acceptable, esp at 5 star hotel.\n- A member of front desk staff seemed to find it amusing that the taxi we had asked to be booked had just been forgotten about. Was a bit odd.\n- I also am still unable to understand why the hotel charges 10 Euros for each 1L bottle of water (more than beer and wine). Think that is a bit cheeky when you are advised to avoid tap water. Pricing in general is quite high for poolside food and drinks.",

For a hotel of this level, that kind of service should be automatic. We had to handle it ourselves until someone finally noticed. Check-in was smooth and efficient, though, which I appreciated.\n\nMy room had a beautiful view and was mostly clean, but one major issue really affected my experience: a part of the shower fell off, and an insect came out of it. I was really scared and tried calling reception, but no one picked up. I even pressed the emergency button and still got no answer. That kind of response-especially in a situation that felt urgent-is completely unacceptable at this level.\n\nThe pool was nice, but the spa was underwhelming. It didn't feel very clean, and my mom had a massage that was just average despite being quite expensive.\n\nWe also ate at the hotel restaurant. The food itself was good, but the service was just okay-nothing memorable or impressive.\n\nThe concierge is connected to the reception, which felt a bit unusual, but they did give us some helpful recommendations. One nice gesture was that they allowed us to check out late, which we appreciated.\n\nIn short, this hotel has potential and some nice aspects, but the overall experience felt like it fell short of true five-star hospitality. I wasn't impressed by the service and wouldn't consider it worth the price.",

Everyone was warm, friendly, and genuinely welcoming. They also gave us great local recommendations for dining and things to do. A special thank you to Giulia, who was especially kind and helpful during our departure-she even helped us book a taxi, which we really appreciated.\n\nOne helpful note for future guests: if you're arriving by car or renting a car, be aware that parking is not directly onsite (which is common in central Palma). The closest parking lot is about a 10-minute walk away. We were able to drop off our luggage first and the staff kindly assisted with directions and bags, but understanding this in advance would have helped us plan better.\n\nOverall, it was a lovely stay in a charming city, and we'd happily return!",

This intimate family restaurant makes you feel a part of the family immediately and Saloua serves such amazing, distinctive and authentic foods. So many new flavour combinations that I never thought were possible.\n\nFrom her special almond flour hummus, to her homemade limoncello. The whole evening was amazing from beginning to end. We arrived at 7:30pm and ended up in deep philosophical conversations up past midnight (4.5hrs).\n\nHonestly, such an amazing incredible story from Saloua and her love and passion for her food shows! Thanks for an unforgettable experience!",

The food was very delicious (especially the short rib) our chicken was a little dry but all our other dishes were fantastic. Our deserts were amazing- definitely try the snickers one! It was very quiet and peaceful in the restaurant, there was only some quiet background music. We had a lovely evening.",

We saw them operate a turn up queuing reservation system for people that wanted a table. Worked perectly and people had a chance to get a drink and then get a table as aoon as one became free.\nThe food is excellent. Tasty, plenty of choice, fresh and really tasty. Everything we ordered was great especially the meat stew (gorgeous tender beef),  quiche lortaine, potato omelette (spanish omelette), small tein baguettes and bacon wrapped dates.

During that time, we had 3 beers and 3 wines at the bar.\n\nAfter all that, the manager told us that if we wanted to eat, we had to leave our seats and wait outside - again! It made no sense and felt very disrespectful.\n\nThe place is small, badly managed, and the terrace waitress was rude and unhelpful.
