I love marketplaces.\nIn this mercado, you can get a single serving of paella in plastic containers from the stalls inside. When in Valencia, having paella is a must. A portion costs around 5–6 euros. I had the original chicken version - with saffron and its special rice, it was an excellent taste. Definitely try it. I can't say anything about the seafood version because I didn't dare to try it :)",

There is a lot of places to seat and rest and just watch animals playing or making their daily activities. The zoo imitates the natural habitat of animals, there is a lot of caves, waterfalls, animals are not separated in caves or an limited area, so it's such a great experience to see them together and happy.\n\nI highly recommend to buy tickets online to skip the queue. Also there is one restaurant, for menu of day (19 euro) you can have a soup, main dish, dessert and drinks. The restaurant has a beautiful terrace so you can eat watching animals.\n\nDefinitely I will come back!",

The bird show is something I wouldn't rave about and if you're short on time give it a miss. Otherwise so fun. They have an open enclosure where the lemurs reside.",

However, the wind was strong and there were some Begu already relaxing there.\nI then looked for a more sheltered spot on the opposite side of the hill.\n\nIt turned out to be a great place, as I was hidden by bushes from early morning joggers and night Begu.\nThe night was cool (17°) for a silly Begi with no sleeping Begu, but I managed to stay warm enough until the sunrise saved my cold self from turning into ice cubes.\n\nI wasn't woken up by the police in the morning (unlike in Almeria), none of my stuff went missing, and no late-night Begu caused any trouble near my tree.\n\nThe sunrise was very pretty. It's a good idea to hang out there early in the morning.\n\nOverall, a great experience-I left to catch a FREEEEE bus at the station 2km east.\nHighly recommend spending a night here if you're in a similar situation.\n#mosquitofree",

Every corner tells a different story.\n\n🔔 Don't miss the climb to the Miguelete Tower - the panoramic view of Valencia's old town is absolutely breathtaking.\n\n💎 Inside, you'll find one of Christianity's most sacred relics: the Holy Grail, believed by some to be the actual cup used by Jesus during the Last Supper.\n\n🎫 There is an entrance fee, but it's absolutely worth it - the audio guide, stunning interior, and powerful atmosphere make it unforgettable.",

The sauce was so rich with a hint of spice. The eel was very tender. We saw another table order Paella Mixta (not on the menu) and it was the perfect balance of the classic paella Valenciana and seafood rice dishes. The flavor of traditional paella is so deep but this also had Norwegian lobster, prawns, mussels, and other various shellfish throughout. It was my dad's birthday so we ordered three desserts - horchata cake, chocolate of the world and ice cream. Finished the meal off with complementary digestives and cremaet, of course!",

The Calamari was one of, if not THE best, I've had. The breading they use is next level. The tuna and tomato salad was light and fresh and everything we hoped for. The \"Paella Mirabel\" had great socarrat and the seafood was cooked to perfection.  Just when we thought we couldn't possibly eat another bite, we caved and ordered dessert. Instead of being dense, the cheesecake was light and fluffy and bit reminiscent of a pavlova. We paired it with cremaet and it was the perfect ending to a wonderful lunch. Our waiter was Walter and he was both attentive and charming. Excellent overall experience and we look forward to returning.",

Entry was 4 euros per person on a Sunday.\n\nYou could spend 45 minutes to a few hours here! There's many many paths to walk down and lots of different plants to view. As you go deeper, there are greenhouses, fountains, trees, and cactus.\n\nThere's seating in the middle but note there is no trees to provide shade so you will be in the direct sun. There was benches along the middle path that are covered by trees but with more foot traffic.\n\nI saw some people sitting and reading and I brought my journal as well.\n\nIt's mostly quiet but there are some big groups unfortunately making a lot of noise. The garden is so big though that you can definitely find a spot for peace and quiet.\n\nI highly recommend coming here! I think it's great for all ages.",

In my experience, which is only two gigs here, I think the sound is poor for a venue of this size; both in terms of the equipment (or lack of) and the quality of the desk.\n\nI honestly have no idea how so many people could comment on the place having good sound; not my experience at all.

We were lucky to come across this gem of a place on some website, they have Flamenco shows (daily if i am not mistaken, but you can always call in advance and ask). Amazing show, amazing passionate dancers, wonderful atmosphere. Tip: the place opens at 7:30 to let the guests in, as they do not take reservations and you cannot buy tickets in advance, be there at around 7:00 to queue and get the best spots 👍🏻but tbh, regardless of where you sit, you will always see the stage.\nAMAZING!

This park, the Turia, used to be a river that flowed through the city and caused floods in the past. Therefore, this river has been transformed into a beautiful park so people can enjoy the nature and various sights where Valencia is known for such as Ciudad de las Artes y Las Ciencias.",

We were so happy that we came to this Pelican Bike Rental instead of the other one by the ocean. Their attitude were fun and solution solving oriented. I am mobility challenged, hard for me to walk around the city let alone the parks. We wanted to get to a restaurant by the beach and go through the Turia Park. They gave us a “ long tail cargo bike” for me to sit at the back instead of a tandem bike. My husband is a cyclist he was so happy to travel the city in a bike with me behind him. We rented the bike for 8 hrs and rode for 6 hrs on and off through Turia park and more. We discovered so much of Valencia through biking around the city and for me to see so much (50km) was beyond my ability. We are so impressed with the infrastructure for Cyclists and scooters in Valencia, world class!\nWe are planning on our next trip back to Valencia already!  Thank you for making this day so special.",
