It was truly beautiful.\n\nWe highly recommend wearing comfortable shoes, as there's a lot of walking involved. Don't forget to bring water and take your time - there are plenty of perfect spots for photos and relaxing strolls.\n\nIt's essential to buy tickets well in advance. We purchased ours two weeks before our visit and could only get the last available time slot. After booking, you have to wait for a confirmation email.\n\nMake sure to get your tickets long before your trip, as entrance is strictly based on the time stated on your ticket - no early entries were allowed for anyone.\nWe didn't had a guide and were able to enjoy the garden.\n\nTo fully enjoy the visit, it's a good idea to prepare children ahead of time and let them know there will be quite a bit of walking involved 😄👍",

We went over the August Bank holiday weekend and it was BUSY - as you'd expect, not to mention incredibly hot, both inside and out.  Take a fan and plenty of water as the place is large!  There is a cafe but we didn't use it.  There seems to be a lot of recommendations about booking in advance, but we booked at about 10pm on Saturday night and got tickets for 11.30 the next morning.  Maybe we were lucky or August is quieter... I don't know.  Book to be on the safe side - I'd recommend using a local operator if poss - prices range from £50 each to £17pp which we opted for!  That said, this didn't include a tour / audio. There were QR codes but didn't try those.  Nothing is in English either - just an observation.  Inside, the palace consisted of a series of interconnected rooms, mainly empty (no furniture) with the exception of beautiful mosaic floors, ceilings, walls, tapestries and plaster work, open courtyards, you get the idea.  Gardens were gorgeous.  Evidently, you can see the Royal bedrooms but have to book far in advance of your visit.",

Tourists today admire the marble, the gold, the columns-but for someone, all this cost a life. Nobody remembers the names of the workers, though nothing would exist without them.\n\n2. Sometimes I look at these buildings and think: was all this beauty really worth those sacrifices? For some, it's a symbol of the nation, but for others, it's years and strength lost.\n\nHonestly, I'm always a bit envious of the architects of that time-to plan something on this scale takes real talent. But at the same time, I feel for those who paid for this “eternity” with their health.\n\nI can't feel just one way about it. The architecture is impressive, but the price was enormous. Sometimes you look at a cathedral and realize there's a heavy shadow behind all that beauty.\n\nWhat about you? Can you just admire places like these, or do you also think about the price?",

The walkway is so fun to wander around, and you get some of the most amazing panoramic views of the city. Seeing all the rooftops and landmarks from a different perspective is a great experience. I went just before sunset, and the golden light over Seville was absolutely magical. It's a great spot for photos and a nice way to end the day.",

I asked the worshipper and see said no problem.\n\nIf you are staying in the Macarena area or passing by it's well worth visiting.

I got the Blossom experience with exfoliation and scalp massage. Carolina was my person and she did a great job and was very friendly. As for the baths part, steam room was perfect, salt bath great but tiny. I came in off season so it wasn't such a problem. The whole situation was disorganized and poorly explained. I got scolded for taking a tiny cup of water in the warm pool. It's only for the lounge area apparently. Some of the staff was unfriendly. I speak a decent amount of Spanish, but struggle to communicate somethings. I feel like it would be easier if they just had a little two minute video and all different languages explaining the whole situation. There was some mold, a little bit here and there . It's an extremely humid environment, so maybe there's not much to be done about that, I don't know. Overall, it was a good experience. If I was local, I would go again, assuming it isn't overcrowded the rest of the year.",

The staff were excellent from the start: welcoming, helpful, and professional.\n\nMy massage at 9 p.m. was genuinely very good, but I felt a little rushed because of the late time slot. The shared massage room setup (separated only by curtains) also made it less private and relaxing than I had hoped. On top of that, the space was louder than expected, which took away from the tranquility.\n\nStill, the quality of the massage and the overall atmosphere make this a memorable spot. I'd recommend going, but try to book an earlier appointment for the best experience.\n\n- @pointstraveleat",

This historic tower, standing proudly along the Guadalquivir River, offers not only a glimpse into Seville's maritime past but also some of the best panoramic views of the city.\nThe architecture of the tower is striking, with its Moorish design and golden hue that gives it its name. The small naval museum inside was an interesting stop, showcasing artifacts, maps, and models that illustrate Seville's rich connection to naval exploration. While the museum is relatively modest, it provides great insight into the tower's historical significance.\nClimbing to the top was the best part. The view of the river, the Cathedral, and the city's rooftops was absolutely stunning-perfect for photos! It's especially breathtaking at sunset.\n\nThe entrance fee was quite reasonable, and the visit didn't take too long, making it an easy stop to fit into a busy itinerary. If you're in Seville and love history, architecture, or simply great views, I highly recommend adding the Torre del Oro to your must-visit list 🤩🤩",

He doesn't have much meaning for them or seeing them.   I believe the cost was roughly 14 euros.  I recommend doing the audio tour as you go through. You can skip ahead at any time, the rooms are numbered so you know which audio to select.

Right at 8pm the staffs opened the shutters, and started bringing people in.\n\nWe got a table upstairs, service was quick.\n\nWe had the signature salad, gazpacho, big clams cooked in wine sauce, croquettes, pork cheek in sauce, and pork shoulder. All are delicious. The sangria are tasty, and dessert of cheese cake is good.\n\nHighly recommended!",

The only downside was I was with 3 other individuals that all tried to download the audio tour, and none of us had success. It was on a qr code. Still was a very interesting part of not only bullfighting history but also of the community. This is one that is still in operation. For someone who really has no interest, I might recommend missing it. I really wanted to understand more of history, and that was accomplished. My favorite part was being in the areana.

Every bite was packed with rich flavors, making it one of the best paellas I've had.\n\nThe tortilla de patatas was also amazing-soft, flavorful, and just the right texture. However, the Gambas al Ajillo didn't quite live up to the rest of the meal. It lacked the bold garlic and olive oil flavors I was expecting.\n\nOverall, though, the experience was fantastic, and I would definitely come back for that paella and tortilla de patatas!",

The food was fresh and the portions were generous - definitely more than just a nibble!\n\nThe chicken was nicely cooked and tender, though it could've used a bit more seasoning. The squid, on the other hand, was absolutely delicious and a standout dish. The quinoa side was a bit bland, but still enjoyable when paired with the other flavours.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this spot and would definitely go back. Great atmosphere, solid food, and a perfect place to take a break while exploring the historic streets of Seville.",

One waiter was excellent and friendly, but the second server was rather rude, and brought my husband a drink in a dirty glass, and then did not replace the drink when she brought a new, empty glass. She also did not check in once after the food was delivered to see if we needed anything (which we did... a new drink!) The food should have been excellent but was mediocre instead. My husband's steak was just okay and small for the price. My rice and scallops had only one large scallop, sliced thinly, at the bottom of the bowl. For that price and that level of dining experience, I expected 5-6 large scallops. The rice was fine, but nothing exceptional. This was supposed to be a celebratory dinner, but it was more hype than value. We weren't even seated next to the window, so there wasn't much of a view.

If you need a break from your sightseeing (or just to get away from the blistering Andalusian summer sun), every street presents numerous cool and inviting opportunities that can slake both thirst and appetite.\n\nWe ducked into this busy restaurant ostensibly for a cool drink after watching a youth marching band perform nearby. Our plans, as usual, quickly changed to having an early dinner after seeing other patrons being served with mouth watering dishes.\n\nWe ordered the pork cheeks (bite size chunks cooked till tender), salmorejo (tomato based cold soup, super refreshing, perfect as a starter), grilled baby squid with diced tomatoes and a heavy dressing of olive oil with balsamic vinegar ( very fresh, not over cooked, still soft and chewy).\n\nHowever, our favorite must have been the tortillitas de camarones. Tiny shrimp embedded in a thin and light batter of chickpea flour fried till crispy. This is the perfect crispy savory snack to go with your ice cold apperitif.\n\nThe chirpy and attentive service staff all speak pretty decent English so ordering was a breeze (they have an English menu). Indoor seating for maybe 25 -30 with additional outdoor seating if you don't mind the siesta inducing heat. If there weren't so many other places to eat from we'd have ended up here more often!",

The grilled squid was perfectly tender and full of flavor, beautifully complemented by fresh tomato slices and a vibrant green herb sauce that made every bite refreshing and delicious. The octopus was another highlight-expertly cooked to a tender yet smoky perfection, served over seasoned potatoes with just the right touch of paprika and a creamy sauce that tied the whole dish together. To finish, we enjoyed a traditional flan de huevo, which was silky, rich, and wonderfully balanced in sweetness. It was the perfect ending to an already exceptional meal.\n\nOn top of the fantastic food, the service truly made the experience special. Our waiter, Luis, was exceptionally friendly and attentive, making us feel welcome and well cared for throughout the meal and suggesting good local beers!\n\nHighly recommend both the dishes and the wonderful service-definitely a place worth returning to!",

I ordered the gazpacho, bull tail croquetas, pork loin in whiskey and Cantabrian anchovies on bread with avocado. It was the perfect way to enjoy some tapas. My partner ordered the huevos rotos and the portion size was very generous! The bulls heads in the restaurant, the mist that cools you down after you walk in from the hot Andalucian sun and the positive atmosphere are really welcoming and pleasant.",
