The middle of the bridge, next to a 17th-century statue of Saint Raphael, is the perfect spot from which to survey Córdoba and the green, hilly countryside that surrounds it: it’s a perspective that even locals stop to enjoy while walking over the Puente Romano.",

It's definitely a must-visit if you're in Córdoba.\n\nThat said, be prepared for large crowds, and it can get quite hot and humid inside.\n\nOne thing to be aware of: there's a small chapel inside that's reserved strictly for prayer. While I respect the purpose, it felt a bit disappointing that this space isn't accessible to all visitors, especially since it's within a paid-entry area. Many similar sites in Europe offer dedicated prayer areas in freely accessible zones, which feels more inclusive.\n\nStill, despite this, the site itself is powerful and well worth a visit.",

The only disappointment was the lack of English. The tour is given in Spanish and if you need a translation you read the pamphlet. During the tour, there were lengthy explanations of the exhibits but maybe 3 or 4 sentences in the corresponding brochure. Despite that minor issue, I recommend seeing the palace and taking the tour.",

Visit is as a group with guard opening the door to the terrace on the first stop to take some photos and enjoy the view, and then climbing up to the bells. There is one more climb up to the highest place possible to visit, but I didn't get there, actually didn't find the way from some reason. But I can say it was good enough view from the bells platform for me. On the way down the lower terrace is closed already.

While the scorching summer heat was undeniable ( at least it was not humid) it could not overshadow the sheer beauty and charm of this place.\n\nThe vibrant flowers that adorned every nook and cranny of Calleja Des las Flores were nothing short of breathtaking. The vivid reds , pinks, and yellows against a backdrop of whitewashed walls created a mesmerizing visual contrast. Strolling through this picturesque alley felt like walking through a living , breathing canvas. I highly recommend this place.",
