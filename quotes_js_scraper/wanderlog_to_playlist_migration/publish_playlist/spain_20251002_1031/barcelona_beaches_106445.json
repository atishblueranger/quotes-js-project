There was a functioning shower which is apparently not common in dry seasons. There's a section on the great left for dogs to play around. There are announcements in spanish, catalan and english alerting for jellyfish, to hydrate, to be attentive for your things, to put sunscreen. No nearby places to get water or food so come prepared. There are people who walk around selling things (water, umbrella). Don't leave your thing unattended.",

The police are always on duty on the beach, which makes the beach safe for vacationers. There are not many vacationers. The vendors do not bother you at all, only three people selling water and blankets pass along the embankment about 6 times a day, they pass quietly and do not disturb at all, if they see that a person is sleeping, they try to quietly pass by and not interfere. You can relax and even fall asleep to the sound of the sea waves, no one will disturb you, since the beach is quiet and only the sound of the sea, of course, if you want to see only the sea, which connects with the sky and the earth.",
