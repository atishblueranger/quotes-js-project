The cable car ride was smooth, safe, and incredibly scenic. As we ascended, the views of the city, coastline, and Montjuïc hill unfolded beautifully before us - absolutely breathtaking!\n\nThe kids were thrilled, and the adults enjoyed every moment too. The cabins are clean, spacious, and offer amazing photo opportunities from every angle. It's a fun and relaxing way to reach the top of Montjuïc, especially if you're heading to the castle.\n\nIt felt like a little adventure in the sky - perfect for families, couples, or even a group of friends. Highly recommended for anyone looking to see Barcelona from a new perspective!",

To get there, take the metro from Catalunya to Paral•lel, then walk through the station until you reach Parc de Montjuïc using same metro ticket, where you can catch the teleferic. You'll need to buy tickets for the teleferic at the ticket office there, and if you plan to explore inside the castle and go to the upper levels, you'll need separate tickets for that from inside. However, if you just want to enjoy the surroundings and the castle from the outside, there's no ticket required. Make sure to soak in the weather, atmosphere, and stunning views while you're there!",

As it was the first weekend of the month it was free after 3pm which was when everything cooled off. Unfortunately the fountains and some escalators were closed.  The eatery near by was ok definitely worth sitting and getting that cold drink and fries.",

Unfortunately not a huge amount to see/do other than the aforementioned view.\n\nIf you go on a hot day be wary that there are not many places to escape the sun although on the top floor there is a nice breeze.\n\nThe cable car journey to and from had equally good views.",
