Literally built over centuries, the size and scope is just unbelievable that it was from materials brought from all over and carried up the mountainside in Granada Spain.\nI recommend taking a bus or taxi up to the entrance as you will walk over 100 steps and walk around 1-3 miles to try to see everything.  The hike up to the Alhambra is a workout on its own!  It's was worth it but I did take a bus back down once I was done.\nI recommend taking a trip here during your lifetime, you won't regret it!",

Right in the center of the city, the building is huge and beautiful, with impressive architecture that mixes Renaissance and Baroque styles.\n\nWhen you walk inside, you're greeted by tall white columns, golden decorations, and colorful stained-glass windows. Everything feels grand and peaceful at the same time. Each chapel inside has its own special artwork and history, making it really interesting to explore.\n\nThe Cathedral was built on the site of an old mosque, so it also tells the story of Granada's history and culture after the Reconquista. Right next to it, the Royal Chapel is also worth seeing-this is where Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand are buried.\n\nIt's a good idea to spend at least an hour here and maybe use an audio guide to learn more about the details. Going early in the day is best if you want to enjoy it without the crowds.\n\nOverall, the Cathedral of Granada is a beautiful and important place that you should definitely visit when in the city.",

We had a wonderful tour with our guide Manuel, and he knew so much about the cathedral, but it was also fascinating because it spans architectural styles (mostly Renaissance) since it took some time for it to be built. A special note is the organ, which is magnificently beautiful. And the white stonework shines as a backdrop to all of the gilded art...it was really like visiting a museum! Again, one of the most impressive cathedrals I have ever had the privilege to tour. Check out these photos! It's just dripping with beauty, even though some of it is over the top architecturally.

Would highly recommend you pay for a guide to explain what your looking at. It's lovely, but will mean more with an explanation. It's amazing to see the restoration that has taken place on the site. There a board that shows you what it looked like in the 1920's. Not and expensive visit. A day well spent.",

I suppose it is a lovely little hidden gem at least for tourists. The gardens are reasonably well maintained for a free tourist attraction. There are fountains, engraved plaques with Spanish poetry, a small building (part of a palace perhaps) to marvel at, as well as bathrooms and potable water near said building. Undoubtedly, one of the highlights were the peacocks strolling about. Not much signage in English, or at all, but there was some information displayed about the origins of this park (as a tribute to the Christian martyrs capture under Islamic rule and invasions).",

From the moment you step inside you are completely surrounded by golden altarpieces intricate carvings and an overwhelming sense of splendor that feels like stepping into another world.\n\nThe highlight is without doubt the main altarpiece a dazzling wall of gold angels and saints that dominates the sanctuary. The combination of sculpture painting and architecture is so rich and detailed that you can spend hours just admiring it. The dome and ceiling frescoes add even more beauty pulling your eyes upward as if heaven itself is opening above.\n\nThis basilica is not only about art it is also about devotion. The relics of St John of God the founder of the Hospitaller Order and patron saint of the sick are kept here. Knowing his history of service and charity adds great spiritual meaning to the place.\n\nThe church is not very large but every corner is filled with treasures silver reliquaries side chapels dedicated to saints and countless Baroque details. If you love history art or simply want to feel the richness of Granadas religious heritage this place is an absolute must.\n\nTip Take your time inside. The lighting changes during the day and every glance reveals something new you did not notice before.",

This has to be the best example of a Moorish hilltop fortress there is and they started building at the Alcazaba in 1238!\nThe Alcazaba itself is an incredible fortress. If you go here, make sure you do the tower at the back. I notices a few tour guides bypassing this. The views from the top over Granada are amazing and should not be missed.\nThere is also so much here from the gardens and the Alcazaba tower to the Nazaries palace and all the nooks and crannies' between. There are also some remarkable treasures on exhibit. You can easily spend a few hours walking around in here.\nWe made a special trip from Malaga to visit and it was well worth it. This is one place you have to visit . I would recommend getting here early. We got here for 08:30 when it opened, which seems to be the perfect time.",
