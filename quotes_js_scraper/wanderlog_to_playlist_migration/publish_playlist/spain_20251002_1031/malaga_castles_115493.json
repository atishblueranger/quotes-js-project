Perched on a hill overlooking the city and the port, this Moorish fortress offers not only a fascinating glimpse into the Islamic past of Spain but also some of the best panoramic views in Málaga.\n\nThe structure is remarkably well-preserved, with beautiful arches, lush gardens, and quiet courtyards that invite you to slow down and imagine what life was like centuries ago. The blend of military strength and delicate design is stunning - especially the intricate stonework and the refreshing water features scattered throughout the site.\nPS:\nA beautiful and peaceful place with great views over Málaga. The architecture and gardens are stunning, and it's perfect for a short historical visit. Highly recommended!",

You can walk pretty much the entire length and the views are spectacular. Not a ton inside the castle walls, but the views alone make this a must do. Free on a Sunday after 2 pm. It'll be nice and quiet if you go before that and pay.",

The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking! They even provide fresh tap water at the hilltop for free, so don't forget to bring a bottle or flask. The total cost is €17 to visit the main castle and the hilltop. You can drive up, but walking is more fun and a great workout. I did the walk in 34°C in August-and I survived!",

The view from the top is truly impressive and well worth the trip.\n\nYou can hike up to the castle if you're in the mood for some exercise, the path is uphill and quite steep, so it's a good little workout. But if walking isn't ideal for you, there's also a bus available that will take you right up to the castle.\n\nWhether you're into photography, sightseeing, or just enjoying a peaceful moment with a view, this spot is absolutely worth a visit.",
