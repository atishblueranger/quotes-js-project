Literally built over centuries, the size and scope is just unbelievable that it was from materials brought from all over and carried up the mountainside in Granada Spain.\nI recommend taking a bus or taxi up to the entrance as you will walk over 100 steps and walk around 1-3 miles to try to see everything.  The hike up to the Alhambra is a workout on its own!  It's was worth it but I did take a bus back down once I was done.\nI recommend taking a trip here during your lifetime, you won't regret it!",

This has to be the best example of a Moorish hilltop fortress there is and they started building at the Alcazaba in 1238!\nThe Alcazaba itself is an incredible fortress. If you go here, make sure you do the tower at the back. I notices a few tour guides bypassing this. The views from the top over Granada are amazing and should not be missed.\nThere is also so much here from the gardens and the Alcazaba tower to the Nazaries palace and all the nooks and crannies' between. There are also some remarkable treasures on exhibit. You can easily spend a few hours walking around in here.\nWe made a special trip from Malaga to visit and it was well worth it. This is one place you have to visit . I would recommend getting here early. We got here for 08:30 when it opened, which seems to be the perfect time.",
