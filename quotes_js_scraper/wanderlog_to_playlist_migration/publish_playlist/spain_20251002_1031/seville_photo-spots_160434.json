We went over the August Bank holiday weekend and it was BUSY - as you'd expect, not to mention incredibly hot, both inside and out.  Take a fan and plenty of water as the place is large!  There is a cafe but we didn't use it.  There seems to be a lot of recommendations about booking in advance, but we booked at about 10pm on Saturday night and got tickets for 11.30 the next morning.  Maybe we were lucky or August is quieter... I don't know.  Book to be on the safe side - I'd recommend using a local operator if poss - prices range from £50 each to £17pp which we opted for!  That said, this didn't include a tour / audio. There were QR codes but didn't try those.  Nothing is in English either - just an observation.  Inside, the palace consisted of a series of interconnected rooms, mainly empty (no furniture) with the exception of beautiful mosaic floors, ceilings, walls, tapestries and plaster work, open courtyards, you get the idea.  Gardens were gorgeous.  Evidently, you can see the Royal bedrooms but have to book far in advance of your visit.",

The sheer amount of detail in the architecture is incredible, and you can see so much history in the different styles.\n\nThe gardens are a whole other level-they're huge and so beautiful, with hidden corners and fountains everywhere. It's the perfect escape from the city heat. I could have happily spent the entire day just wandering through them.\n\nMy biggest recommendation, especially if you're visiting in the summer, is to pre-book your tickets online. Seriously, don't even think about showing up to buy them on the day. The lines can be absolutely brutal, and you'll spend a ton of time waiting in the heat. Booking online gets you a specific time slot and lets you skip the main queue, so you can head straight to security and start exploring right away. It's the best way to make sure you get in and make the most of your visit without any stress.",

Tourists today admire the marble, the gold, the columns-but for someone, all this cost a life. Nobody remembers the names of the workers, though nothing would exist without them.\n\n2. Sometimes I look at these buildings and think: was all this beauty really worth those sacrifices? For some, it's a symbol of the nation, but for others, it's years and strength lost.\n\nHonestly, I'm always a bit envious of the architects of that time-to plan something on this scale takes real talent. But at the same time, I feel for those who paid for this “eternity” with their health.\n\nI can't feel just one way about it. The architecture is impressive, but the price was enormous. Sometimes you look at a cathedral and realize there's a heavy shadow behind all that beauty.\n\nWhat about you? Can you just admire places like these, or do you also think about the price?",

There are a lot of level window nooks with flat seating for when you need a break. It would say it's moderately steep, but doable, especially because there are opportunities to rest. The up/down traffic is on the same path which made it a bit crowded in places. But the view at the top is beautiful. The frequent windows did let in some fresh air and slight breeze, but it was pretty warm in early June about noon.",

Unbelievable ceilings, artwork, golden alters, individual ornate chapels and so much more! It seems to go on forever. This chapel is a photographer's dream!\n\nThe tomb of Christopher Columbus was fascinating to me. I've never seen anything like it. The craftsmanship of the monument is remarkable.\n\nThere is an opportunity to climb La Giralda bell tower too. Instead of stairs, they have ramps that make it easier than expected. The panoramic views over Seville's rooftops are breathtaking from above!\n\nIts smart to book tickets early and to plan on taking your time inside. There's a lot to see and appreciate.

The intricate carvings are highlighted by colored lights from the stained glass that gradually moved across the walls and floors. There is a crypt area below that details the history of the city and the church which is well curated. Highly recommend!",

It would most likely be much more remarkable and popular if it wouldn't be located meters away from Seville Cathedral and Giralda. Think it's very underrated while it have a lot to offer simply because it was the main Seville church between regaining the city from Arabs till funds from America started to arrive, so Cathedral could be rebuilt into its today's shape. If you buy tickets for the Cathedral directly from their website, you won't have to pay for entry. If you done / are about to do guided tour of Cathedral and Giralda, then you'll have to pay 7€ to enter (I don't regret it at all).",

The palace is full of charm and history, with beautiful architecture, peaceful gardens, and fascinating exhibitions that give insight into Seville's noble past. There is an entrance fee, but it's absolutely worth it for the experience.

You can access via your phone or the gift shop has devices you can use for this purpose.  A neat act is that someone actually lives in the building. He doesn't have much meaning for them or seeing them.   I believe the cost was roughly 14 euros.  I recommend doing the audio tour as you go through. You can skip ahead at any time, the rooms are numbered so you know which audio to select. There was some minor road construction leading to the palace, but there are signs to ensure that you can find your way",

This historic tower, standing proudly along the Guadalquivir River, offers not only a glimpse into Seville's maritime past but also some of the best panoramic views of the city.\nThe architecture of the tower is striking, with its Moorish design and golden hue that gives it its name. The small naval museum inside was an interesting stop, showcasing artifacts, maps, and models that illustrate Seville's rich connection to naval exploration. While the museum is relatively modest, it provides great insight into the tower's historical significance.\nClimbing to the top was the best part. The view of the river, the Cathedral, and the city's rooftops was absolutely stunning-perfect for photos! It's especially breathtaking at sunset.\n\nThe entrance fee was quite reasonable, and the visit didn't take too long, making it an easy stop to fit into a busy itinerary. If you're in Seville and love history, architecture, or simply great views, I highly recommend adding the Torre del Oro to your must-visit list 🤩🤩",
