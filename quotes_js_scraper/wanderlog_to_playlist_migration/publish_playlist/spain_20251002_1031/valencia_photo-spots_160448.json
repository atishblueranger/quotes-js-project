A portion costs around 5–6 euros. I had the original chicken version - with saffron and its special rice, it was an excellent taste. Definitely try it. I can't say anything about the seafood version because I didn't dare to try it :)",

The Museum is a must for every person that's interested in science/ the human body!\nWe are two medstudents and we loved it but it's definitely something children would love as well! The Movie is just an experience for the eyes, the big round screen is unique and therefore very interesting!\nThe Seaanimals are very nice to watch. However, might be the case that they have multiple certifications but to have beluga whales in an Aquarium and Dolphines for a show, even if it isn't as disciplined as some other shows, isn't really acceptable. We on purpose didn't go to the show and we read afterwards some articles which stated the show is very dolphins friendly and the circumstances are far from shows at Seaworld etc. but we heard the crowd from far and Dolphines are very intelligent and sensitive animals which is why that's not acceptable. Just because they don't treat the Dolphines as cruel as others, doesn't mean it's not cruel.\nAnd to keep them and even bigger animals, belugas, in a tank of water when normally they would wander thousands of miles in the ocean just makes me very sad.\nAnd I am aware, that they also support the ecosystem sea in a way but I would like to see at least no Dolphines and Whales in Tanks way to small for their needs.\n\nWe won't be coming back, I wouldn't necessarily recommend anyone going there. The only case I would go back is probably with kids, for educational purposes.\n\nHowever, still 3 Stars for the Cinema and the Museum.",

There is a lot of places to seat and rest and just watch animals playing or making their daily activities. The zoo imitates the natural habitat of animals, there is a lot of caves, waterfalls, animals are not separated in caves or an limited area, so it's such a great experience to see them together and happy.\n\nI highly recommend to buy tickets online to skip the queue. Also there is one restaurant, for menu of day (19 euro) you can have a soup, main dish, dessert and drinks. The restaurant has a beautiful terrace so you can eat watching animals.\n\nDefinitely I will come back!",

The air conditioning was a relief from the Spanish heat. There's a small cafeteria with vending machines where you can grab a snack or drink for a reasonable price and take a break. The garden outside is also beautiful and perfect for sitting down for a moment.\n\nThe overall atmosphere was very welcoming, with friendly staff and security.

We visited the Greek islands, cruised along the Italian coast, spent some time in the Balearics, and only then set course for Valencia. In total, the voyage took us about three weeks, but every stop was absolutely worth it.\nWhen we finally arrived at La Marina de Valencia, we were immediately impressed by its scale. The marina is spacious, well-organized, and provides great protection from waves and strong winds. The staff was efficient-they met us at the entrance, helped with mooring, and provided all the necessary information.\nFor a long-term stay, this marina is incredibly convenient. It offers electricity, water, 24/7 security, showers, laundry, a service area for maintenance, as well as shops, restaurants, and even sports facilities. The city center is just a short ride away, and the nearby beaches are within walking distance.\nWe stayed here for two weeks, taking care of the boat, relaxing, and exploring the city. Valencia is vibrant and full of character, with a charming old town, modern districts, and amazing local cuisine. There were also plenty of activities right in the marina-windsurfing, seaside walks, and even regattas in the bay.\nThe weather was mostly pleasant, though we did experience a couple of windy days, which made us appreciate the marina's excellent shelter. Mooring remained comfortable even in rougher conditions.\nOverall, La Marina de Valencia left us with the best impressions. It's a fantastic spot for a long stay after a major crossing, with top-notch facilities and a perfect location. If we sail through the Mediterranean again, Valencia will definitely be on our list of stops!",
