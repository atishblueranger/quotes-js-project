Perched on a hill overlooking the city and the port, this Moorish fortress offers not only a fascinating glimpse into the Islamic past of Spain but also some of the best panoramic views in Málaga.\n\nThe structure is remarkably well-preserved, with beautiful arches, lush gardens, and quiet courtyards that invite you to slow down and imagine what life was like centuries ago. The blend of military strength and delicate design is stunning - especially the intricate stonework and the refreshing water features scattered throughout the site.\nPS:\nA beautiful and peaceful place with great views over Málaga. The architecture and gardens are stunning, and it's perfect for a short historical visit. Highly recommended!",

With each step, the city of Málaga stretches wider beneath you - its whitewashed houses, its busy port, and the deep blue sea reaching into the horizon.\n\nThe fortress walls, sturdy yet graceful, trace the ridges of the hill like guardians of memory. Walking along the ramparts, you feel the weight of centuries under your feet - Moorish soldiers once keeping watch, Christian kings later claiming the same heights, all leaving their echoes in the stones.\n\nInside, open courtyards bathe in sunlight, and the rough stone walls are softened by wildflowers growing between the cracks. The silence is broken only by the call of seabirds circling overhead and the laughter of visitors leaning against the battlements, capturing views that painters and poets once tried to preserve.\n\nFrom the highest tower, the panorama is breathtaking: the bullring below, the cathedral rising proudly in the heart of the city, and beyond it all, the endless shimmer of the sea. It is a view that ties past and present together - a reminder of Málaga's resilience, its mixture of cultures, and the timeless embrace of land and water.\n\nLeaving Gibralfaro, you don't just carry photographs. You carry a memory: of wind in your hair, sun on the ancient stones, and the feeling of having stood at a crossroads where history still breathes.",

Hectic but fun atmosphere.\nThe terrace is in the back and quite big! It has a view of the nearby ruins so pretty nice spot.\nFound is not the best i have had but pretty fair for the location and vibe. Menu was big enough with all the main generic tapas. I definitely recommend everyone to try this place at least once. You don't go there only for food, but more for the atmosphere and central location.\nCould sit and eat for hours chilling under the sun on the terrace.\nCocktails seem delicious but we mainly had wine.\nService was good.",

The atmosphere is undeniably charming-vibrant, full of character, and beautifully located in the heart of the old town. The restaurant was packed, and while that's a good sign, it did affect the service. We only saw our waiter when he took our order, and another brought us the bill, which made it feel a bit impersonal.\n\nWe shared the Mediterranean salad, and tried both the sea bream and the chicken. The dishes arrived hot and fresh, which we appreciated. The flavours were a bit on the mild side-not bland in a bad way, but definitely understated. That said, we'd rather season our own food than be overwhelmed by salt.\n\nOverall, the food was good, but not particularly memorable. You come here more for the experience and ambiance than for a standout culinary moment. Worth a visit if you want to soak in the local vibe, but maybe not a place we'd rush back to for the food alone.",

Honestly the desserts were the highlight of the meal. The bread was also very tasty.\n\nA warning for folks-the carrot soup is really more of a seafood soup, it tastes like what I would call “ocean brine.” I actually loved the cockles in the briny soup and I usually don't like clams served cold at all. But the soup itself should be more of a garnish than a soup… No idea who's going to be able to eat more than a couple bites of that!\n\nAlso a note for the restaurant-we were seated at a table by the back wall that was extremely brightly lit. In particular the strip lighting near the floor bothered my partner throughout the dinner. Perhaps remove a few lights? Never met a restaurant that needed any white lights whatsoever :)",

The atmosphere no longer feels warm or welcoming-hospitality felt rushed and impersonal, and the energy of the space now feels overly masculine and commercial.\n\nThe food quality is still good, don't get me wrong.

Despite this, the extremely helpful and efficient girl behind the bar explained the drill; our 10€ had gained us entry and a free drink, we could sit at the table and receive table service for the evening too.\nThe 'band' were slightly late and just before they started, the place seemed to fill up quite quickly; I can imagine it is busier as we move into the warmer months so advice would be to get there early if you want a good seat (there are probably about 30 great seats with tables, then another 20 or so around the edges, further but not too far away from the performance. Those who were late stayed towards the bar, and i suspect others who were just there to drink (you could hear the vibrant chatter behind but it wasn't too much of a distraction to not avoid the show; like I said, get there earlier.\nThe band consisted of 3 blokes, it was a jam sesh so others joined after the first interval; the main 3 drummer, bassist and guitarist. They were very good as were those who'd come to jam. It felt rather familiar despite the setting being quite smart and classy. We stayed until about 23.30 and another group were proficiently moved into our space. Service was excellent, I'm not sure how the young waitress with glasses on coped with the demand of the bar and table service, but she did...and very well too.\n100% recommend this place on all levels.",

Everything that I tried was exceptional!\n\nThe sea bass with white garlic sauce was the standout protein, in my opinion. But surprisingly, the best thing I tasted there were roasted carrots and hummus. It was the perfect example of taking a basic ingredient and cooking it to perfection to make it a star!\n\nIf you are ever in Málaga, you have to eat here at least once.",

It's also worth noting that this is a traditional spa where there are no pools, just peaceful, beautiful rooms with hot water flowing all around to pour over yourself. Then we had tea up on the rooftop balcony overlooking the city (see photos - beautiful - but can't take pictures inside the spa). Definitely recommended!",
