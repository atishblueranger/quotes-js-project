The architecture is unlike anything else.\n\nWe chose the evening tour and are so glad we did (tickets purchase required in advance). The house is beautifully lit at night and adds a whole extra level to the experience. I can't even describe the feeling I had being in there, but I didn't want to leave! It was definitely a highlight of our trip to Europe.\n\nWe did the package with the VR guide on tablet, which was kind of cheesy and didn't always line up correctly with the house, but the audio guide over it was great for learning more about the house design. We weren't drinking but we were able to get juice instead - I couldn't find this information online beforehand so wanted to share :)\n\nWhy only 4 stars?\n\nIt was an incredible experience to walk through this house and learn about it, but please do something different with the crowd sizes you allow in. In some rooms we were shoulder to shoulder with people and could barely move, which really killed the vibe. In a couple areas staff was urging us to hurry along because the crowd was getting backed up, so I didn't get to spend the time with it I wanted. It was pricier than most other museums but the others have much better crowd management (for example it's 30% more than Louvre tickets, and I felt less rushed viewing the Mona Lisa than I did in some areas in the home.)",

This stunning church, built back in the 14th century, showcases the beautiful Catalan Gothic style. The tall columns and lovely stained-glass windows create such a peaceful and awe-inspiring vibe.\n\nIf you're planning a visit, keep in mind that the entrance fee varies based on what you want to see. A basic visit to explore the temple, gallery, and crypt will cost you €5. If you're up for some incredible views, you can access the towers and the roof terrace for an extra €10, or join a guided tour that includes both for €15-that full ticket comes with rooftop access!\n\nWhile we decided to admire it from the outside (not uncommon since there's a ticket fee), we were delighted by how charming the area around the church is. It's tucked away in a nice, shaded corner, perfect for a little respite from the heat. Plus, you can enjoy a lovely stroll around the pretty surroundings!",

To get there, take the metro from Catalunya to Paral•lel, then walk through the station until you reach Parc de Montjuïc using same metro ticket, where you can catch the teleferic. You'll need to buy tickets for the teleferic at the ticket office there, and if you plan to explore inside the castle and go to the upper levels, you'll need separate tickets for that from inside. However, if you just want to enjoy the surroundings and the castle from the outside, there's no ticket required. Make sure to soak in the weather, atmosphere, and stunning views while you're there!",

Having previously visited the Picasso museums in Paris (the largest collection worldwide) and Málaga (his birthplace), we were excited to explore Barcelona's museum - the very first dedicated to Picasso and the only one opened during his lifetime.\n\nThe location is great: nestled in the heart of the Gothic Quarter, with its maze of medieval streets and charming atmosphere. The museum itself is a beautiful blend of history and modernity, recently renovated but still housed in stunning medieval buildings, complete with magnificent staircases, stone walls, and ornate facades. Honestly, the architecture alone is worth the visit...\n\nThe collection is well-organized and thoughtfully curated. We loved discovering some of Picasso's very early works, including a breathtaking First Communion painting - incredibly impressive considering he painted it at just 15. The transition through his different periods is clearly displayed, from his first portraits to the Blue Period and the early explorations of Cubism. The collection is not overwhelmingly large, which in my opinion is a plus (you can comfortably see everything in about two hours without feeling rushed).\n\nPersonally, I found the Velázquez-inspired “Las Meninas” variations absolutely fascinating, especially the large-format piece - a true highlight of the visit. I also appreciated the series of works inspired by his time in Paris, a recurring theme that shows the lasting influence of Cubism on his style.\n\nWe were also lucky to catch a temporary exhibition dedicated to Francoise Gilot (French painter, long term partner of Picasso, and mother of Claude and Paloma Picasso) with some of her own art on display (drawings, watercolors and a few ceramics), as well as pieces connected to Claude Picasso and the family, a touching and insightful addition to the experience.\n\nOverall, this museum is well worth visiting, whether for its architecture, its intimate but rich collection, or the chance to gain a clearer understanding of Picasso's early work and evolving artistic phases. A must if you want to appreciate not just the art, but also the context and influences that shaped this iconic figure.",

There are a lot of sellers offering you things to buy every ten seconds, which is a little unpleasant.\n\nThe greenery is very beautiful, the trees are mature and the constructions are gorgeous. The lake would be beautiful as it is but it is always packed with tourists on boats. The fountains work and they are really pretty, it is not too crowded and you will not mind all the tourists. The only esthetically unpleasing sight of the park are all the metal fences around the trees.\n\nThere is a sign you cannot step on the grass but everybody is having a picnic on the grass, so do not worry too much about that. They dont really mind.\n\nThere is a small shop where you can buy (overpriced, but that is to be expected) snacks and drinks.\n\nThere a few toilets and I assume they work, but they are dirty and unpleasant and they do not have toilet paper, so bring a tissue.\n\nOverall a nice place to check out if you are in Barcelona and want a breath of chiller air. There is always a free bench to relax on.",

We visited as a family of four and the price of tickets for here was much more reasonable than other museums.\n\nUnfortunately, it was extremely hot on the day we visited and we struggled a little inside in the heat.  Few rooms had air con.\n\nWe didn't have headphones so had to carefully listen to the guide on our phones. We didn't want to be annoying to others so kept it as quiet as possible.  The commentary was very informative and it was great how it corresponded to each room.\n\nThe rooms were beautiful and the roof terrace was stunning.\n\nDefinitely recommend a visit.",

From the moment we arrived, the evening promised something special-and it delivered.\n\nWe began with a table full of flavorful tapas and refreshing drinks, setting the tone for what was to come. As the performance began, the intimate venue brought every element to life. The dancers and musicians poured raw emotion into every movement and note-expressing deep passion through voice, rhythm, and presence. You could feel every wail in the singers' voices, every stomp of the dancers' feet, and every strum of the guitar reverberate through the space. It was immersive, mesmerizing, and deeply emotional.\n\nFollowing the performance, we visited the upstairs guitar museum and learned about the rich history of Casa Sors. The founder's legacy in the world of flamenco lives on through his son, Diego, who now leads the space. Diego shared his father's story, demonstrated the craftsmanship behind various guitars, and performed several pieces-each one revealing something unique about the instrument and the tradition.\n\nMy friend and I stayed behind, drawn in by the beauty of the moment. To our surprise, Diego honored us with a private concert-first on his father's guitar, then on the piano with one of his own original compositions. It was an unexpected gift that moved us to tears.\n\nIf you're looking for an authentic flamenco experience that showcases multiple styles and the heart of the tradition, Casa Sors is a must. And yes-splurge for the VIP experience. It's worth every euro.",

In addition, there is also an amusement park for children, not so special I would say. The only thing missing from this place is the cafe, which was closed at the time of our visit, and it looked like it had been closed for a long time.

Booked this place for my mothers 60th and right from the first day when checking in, staff where attentive, so helpful and knowledgeable!\n\nThe hotel is so clean, smells amazing (wish I knew what they used), in a great location with everything you could want nearby. The room cleaners do a fantastic job everyday and the breakfast buffet selection is absolutely divine!\n\nSo much variety and choice, so you can easily try something new everyday and not feel bored. They constantly come around asking if you are OK and need anything else and offer to make fresh omelettes etc.\n\nWithout even asking, they surprised my mother during breakfast with champagne, chocolate cake and a song and when they came back to their room later that night, had a whole bottle and another slice of cake waiting for them which was delicious and so thoughtful!\n\nThe staff are so knowledgeable and friendly and know the area really well and have great recommendations for places to go visit and eat at and everything was spot on!\n\nA massive thank you to Iris who worked the front desk at reception, as she was the one I spoke to the most and was an amazing member of staff who was always smiling and helped our family enjoy our stay this week.\n\nAlso, a big thank you to Ana, who works in the dining area, who was always on hand during breakfast, made sure everything was spotless and ran smoothly. I got to say thank you to Ana but not Iris unfortunately, so please give them both something special on behalf of my family.\n\nWill definitely recommend this place to colleagues, family and friends in the future and I hope to visit some day again!

The pictures I'm posting here were made with my Mi Note 14 pro phone but the \"real\" ones, taken with a Nikon and  650mm tele-lens are something else. If you can, go early in the morning or late in the evening as the sun, at the time I was there, shines from the opposite side making images quite flat. The V19 bus will leave you, on it's last stop, a mere 200 meters (climb) from the top, making it very convenient. The Catalan \"old\" people we met in the bust were very helpful, in contrast with the younger locals who are definitely not well educated and oblivious to the importance of the impact of tourism in Barcelona's economy. Tourists should behave and be civil, locals should be demanding and   helpful. Seems youngsters have abused the Bunkers recently, throwing load raves with lots of drinking and drugs abuse, and the local management closes the access to this place before sundown, nowadays. A pity. I bet the sunset, seen from here must be amazing. Keep the Bunkers on your shortlist of places to visit if you're into photography, anyway",

The tuna tasted light it was caught that morning. Every dish was picture perfect. Our 2 servers were kind, funny, thoughtful….exquisite! They noticed my husband was left handed and asked him which hand he cuts his meat with! The details were just perfect. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant for anyone wanting a unique experience in Barcelona. Also, we could not believe the price. We have had tasting menus 3-4 times this price. And not as good as Con Gracia!",

When I ate it while imagining the taste from the appearance of the dish, it was shown to be far beyond my expectations in terms of flavor, texture, aroma, and harmony. Personally, I was most impressed by the artichokes that blended with other ingredients such as mushrooms in a way I have never experienced before, the soup that brought together the depth of shrimp, and the unique approach to Wagyu beef that I have never seen in Japan. I also had a lot of high-quality wines, and was impressed by the value I felt at the bill. At other restaurants, there are cases where unnecessarily expensive items are served and the price tends to be inflated, but that is not the case at Lasarte. The service was also extremely sincere. I would definitely like to visit again.",

Could've been a good day for the restaurant or a bad one and I still would've had my mind blown. To say otherwise is pompous. Only critique would be to confirm the cost of certain add-ons like water and coffee.",
