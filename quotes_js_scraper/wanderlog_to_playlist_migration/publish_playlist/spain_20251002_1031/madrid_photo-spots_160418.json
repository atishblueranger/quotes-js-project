While it's still the official residence of Spain's royal family, it's more about exploring the palace's history and the country than catching a glimpse of royalty. With over 3,000 rooms including the Royal Kitchen, Royal Armory, Painting Gallery, and a Hall of Mirrors reminiscent of Versailles, there's plenty to explore inside.",

Inside are paintings and furniture from hundreds of years ago all preserved for you to see. This is Europe's largest palace and the grandeur and  opulence shows it. You can visit yourself, but they also offer guided tours for only a few euros more. They run guided tours in Spanish all day long, but also run English guided tours twice a day. They also have Italian guided tours offered distractions as well. I works recommended getting a guided tour as there's so much history inside that you won't know about. Very fascinating.",

I experienced the beauty of this park in winter as well as during the summer. This is truly a beautiful park, a calm escape from the bustling city. The sculpture gardens, the rose garden, the great pond is all worth visiting when in this park. Feeding the ducks and turtles in the pond was so amazing. The entire park filled with its greenery is beyond imagination. The most amazing part is that this park was opened to public in 1868 and until this day, the beauty of this park has remained intact! Such a well-maintained park, giving you a feeling of ease, comfort and happiness. I missed boating in December but made it a point to rent a boat for boating this time when I was there. Such an amazing experience to row a boat on your own. It is a great place for families and friends to meet up and have a quiet picnic there with their loved ones. I highly recommend visiting this park when in Madrid!",

Unique architectural concept.\n\nUpon walking inside, you are immediately confronted with the modern and contemporary art section. These sections were wonderful and it is very interesting for a museum to have both classical and modern / contemporary artworks all in one building. The film installations were quite bizarre to say the least (in a good way), but told an interesting story that I liked.\n\nHowever, once you ascend up the staircases, you get to enjoy all the art before the modern and contemporary.\n\nMy favorite section was about an artist called Nestor de la Torre, an artist from the Canary Islands I did not know about before. His paintings spanned many large rooms, and they were all incredible. The Reína Sofía did a great job on exhibiting many of this little-known artist's works. I must say that his paintings have a quality that upon viewing, you know immediately it is this artist's style. Truly unique, one of a kind. I do not know why he is not represented more in the art scene of today.\n\nOf course, there are the other very famous rooms, which display works by Picasso and Dalí. The singular most infamous work on display is Picasso's Guernica, which tells the suffering of war. Some of Dalí's most famous paintings are there as well\n\nI recommend checking out the sketches that Picasso made of the weeping ladies he has displayed in Guernica to get a clear sense of the level of preparation that Picasso did.\n\nOverall, a fantastic museum and great experience. I think this museum - in my opinion - has one of the most intriguing collections of modern art I have seen thus far in all my travels to world class museums. 🖼️\n\nPlease go here if you are in Madrid. The Reína Sofía also has a wonderful, amazing store filled with so many great books that I wanted to take back with me! 😊",

I suppose this is only on weekends. I'm not sure on weekdays. So we decided to take the opportunity and we waited in line ( not that long and good thing everybody seated yet in line along those short walls in front of entrance).\nOnce ur inside the museum is pretty big with 4 stories. Currently, the 3rd floor is closed. 1st floor and 4th floor has temporary exhibition, so i believe they often update new one. But the main highlight was Pablo Picasso, Guernica' famous painting at 2nd floor room no.205. You can also find Dali painting as well. Most of the people are on the 2nd floor. Rest its pretty much contemporary arts and paintings, which my wife is not a big fan of it. At some points, yes, it is hard to understand and appreciate the beauty, although the 19th/20th century artists do express themselves.\nOverall, it was good to see at least one famous Picasso painting. The building layout is a bit confusing, though. Since it was free, it was not bad. Spend 1 and half.",

You can enjoy a cup of drink, families, couples and dogs around you will make your evening great. Also once you are with your drink and sunset, walk down through the Royal Palace (10mins) which is mostly crowded with tourist(easy to follow without map) and take some photos there before sun fully sets as well. From that moment, there are many great small cafes and bistros that you can enjoy some bites while crowd passes by and feel the city with lively buzz",

Apparently, there used to be reflecting pools on both sides, but they're gone now. I had to look it up online because it didn't feel like a historical site at all. As far as I can tell, only a small part of it is original - it's been heavily restored. I think its fame is mostly due to a bandwagon effect. The surrounding park is much nicer - ideal for walking and relaxing. To enter, you have to scan the QR code shown in the picture and wait about 20 minutes. They only allow 15 people inside at a time. I didn't go in, and honestly, I wasn't that curious.",

Depending on your pace, you could be at this museum for a while. My favourite illusion was the vortex, as it is a really cool experience and it really makes you feel like you are spinning in an actual vortex. If that's your thing, it is the last illusion downstairs at the very end of the room. This museum is also not far from the train line, so you can travel here easily.\nIn sum, if you're wanting something to do while you're in Madrid, come here!",

The whole area does seem well taken care of as well.\n\nThere's also stairs surrounding the garden that you'll either have to go down to reach the garden or up after looking around but is definitely worth taking time to take pictures or selfies as it's a very nice view from atop.

In 1980, it was designated a public historic park through an agreement with the city council. The park features groves of olive, stone pine, eucalyptus, and especially almond trees. These almond blossoms create a spectacular scene from mid-February to early March, typically lasting around 13 days. Besides its natural charm, the park also houses cultural spaces including a greenhouse, a historic villa, and Espacio Abierto.",

Each room is completely different, not only because of the art, but also the experience just to look at them, touch them, feel them, and have different activities, a lot to see and enjoy. They even decorated the whole place with Halloween decoration in October. We enjoyed the sweets as well which we got in the different rooms. The sour one was very sour! :) Highly recommended, don't forget to wear clothes which have white writing/art on them because there are a lot of rooms where it is glowing in the dark :)",

            "text": "Well hello Madrid, where the sun shines bright and the tapas are plentiful. But there's a different kind of snack that's been standing in the heart of the city for centuries. I'm talking about the iconic statue of The Bear and the Strawberry Tree (?) tree?\n\nAccording to the tour guide, This bronze statue isn't just a landmark; it's a personality. A stoic bear casually reaching for a piece of fruit from a tree. The bear represents the city's strength and wild animal population, and the tree symbolizes the land and its resources. (I said strawberry tree yes).\n\nNow, let's me explain the strawberry tree, I had to look it up; while it's called the \"strawberry tree,\" the strawberries we know and love don't actually grow on trees. Right? The tree in the statue is a strawberry tree (is called Arbutus unedo, a n actual real fruit-bearing tree native to the Mediterranean region whose fruit looks similar to a strawberry. So while it's not the strawberry for your ice cream, it's a fitting symbol for Madrid's wild past.\n\nThis statue represents a serious medieval dispute. The city's official emblem commemorates a resolution between the city council and the clergy over rights to the forests and resources. They settled the debate by dividing the land, with the clergy getting the forests and the city gaining rights to the animals and other resources.\n\nThis historical resolution serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of the separation of church and state. It's a timeless principle that we still debate today. The Bear and the Strawberry Tree, in its quiet corner of Madrid, shows us that these conversations have been happening for centuries.",
