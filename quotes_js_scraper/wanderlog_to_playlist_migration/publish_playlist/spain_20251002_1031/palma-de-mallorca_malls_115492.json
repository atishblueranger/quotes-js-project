If you are an EU citizen you can also go there between some hours that are listed at the entrance to get a free ticket. I suggest you look into it before you go, so you don't have to pay for the ticket. Otherwise it was very pretty the view is amazing and the palace is really interesting. We just walked around the place and we needed 45 minutes so i think it would take longer if we had an audio guide.",

It's steep and a bit of incline.\n\nLook for a kiosk sign with an I. It has a map in Spanish but easy to follow. The map is pertinent to the bottom floor of the castle. Lots of storyboards in  multiple languages, including English.\n\nThere's also a historical timetable of the city that is equally interesting, along with maps.\n\nWashrooms are available throughout that are quite clean.

We joined the tour just across the road from Palma train station and purchased our tickets onboard. Prices were reasonable. There were loads of stops along the way, including a lovely drive up to Bellver Castle. The cathedral view from the bus was beautiful, which was when we departed the bus. The tour was informative and discussed the history of the city, but we felt that there was not much more to say about Palma city (not faulting City Sightseeing at all, just an observation about Palma City). The tour is definitely worthwhile.",

It's a good way to see some of Mallorca quickly and handy about the fact that you can jump on and off for the whole day. What was not clear was the fact that there were some attractions I could visit for free with my ticket. However, I didn't think this was made clear enough by the person who sold me the ticket outside the Cathedral, so if you go, be sure to ask as you may miss out. I found being on top deck was the best place to sit, although this meant getting cooked alive in the process as the sun was on full blast the day i visited. Would be great if but had some shelter but open on the sides. These are some of the views I saw from the bus.",

            "text": "(Translated by Google) It's a very nice place 😉, I walked up from the harbor, there were a lot of stairs but the view and the nature made it easier. At the castle you need a ticket, which normally costs €4 without a discount, you should get it before taking the last steps to the castle.\nThe castle view is very beautiful, it was already very warm but it was very pleasant in the vaults.\nThe view and foresight is very beautiful, you can see a lot of the island.\nYou should definitely do it.😊👍\n\n(Original)\nEs ist ein sehr schöner Ort 😉,Ich bin vom Hafen hoch gelaufen, es waren sehr viele Treppen aber die Aussicht und die Natur haben es leichter gemacht.Bei der Burg braucht man ein Ticket,das kostet normal ohne Ermäßigung 4 €,sollte man holen,bevor man sie letzten Stufen zu Burg nimmt.\nDie Burg Ansicht ist sehr schön,es war schon sehr warm aber in den Gewölbe war es sehr angenehm.\nDie Aus und Weitsicht ist sehr schön, man sieht sehr viel von der Insel.\nMan sollte es auf alle Fälle machen.😊👍",
