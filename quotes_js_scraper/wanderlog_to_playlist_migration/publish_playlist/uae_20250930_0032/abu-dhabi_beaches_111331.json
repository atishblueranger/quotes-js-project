The city boasts several pristine beaches, with some of the most popular being Corniche Beach, Saadiyat Beach, and the private beaches of luxury resorts like the Emirates Palace.\n\nCorniche Beach is the most accessible public beach, with well-maintained facilities, plenty of space, and stunning views of the turquoise waters of the Arabian Gulf. It's perfect for a leisurely day out, with a long walking and cycling path along the coastline, sunbeds for rent, and shaded areas. The beach is clean, family-friendly, and has a great vibe for relaxing, though it can get crowded during weekends and holidays.\n\nSaadiyat Beach, located on Saadiyat Island, is known for its natural beauty and quieter atmosphere. It has soft white sand and crystal-clear water, making it perfect for swimming and sunbathing. The beach is also home to some of the city's most luxurious resorts, but it is still accessible to the public. The surrounding nature, including mangroves and wildlife, adds to the serene vibe of Saadiyat Beach, though access might be limited to certain areas.\n\nFor those staying at luxury hotels or resorts like the St. Regis Saadiyat Island Resort, the Ritz-Carlton, or the Emirates Palace, you'll find private, exclusive beaches with impeccable service and stunning views. These spots provide great opportunities for water sports, beach clubs, and more.\n\nWhile Abu Dhabi's beaches are undoubtedly beautiful, the water temperature can be quite",

The showers and free drinking water stations are also a big plus, making it easy to rinse off and stay refreshed after a day in the sun.\n\nI absolutely love that you can bring your own food and drinks, which makes it perfect for a relaxing picnic by the water. There's also plenty of space to play sports-whether it's volleyball, frisbee, or any other fun outdoor activity, you'll find the perfect spot.\n\nOverall, Abu Dhabi Beach is a delightful destination that combines cleanliness, accessibility, and recreational opportunities.

The resort has a lively feel, thanks to its colorful decor and chic furniture. It's a bit on the expensive side, but the cleanliness and well-organized setting justify the cost. Definitely a good pick for a luxury escape.",

            "text": "As a mother coming to this hotel was something I looked forward to for a long time. We booked a one bedroom bungalow with promising  privacy and a swimming pool. Just before 7AM we were woken up by a terribly loud drilling sound. It was so loud that I practically jumped out of bed. Needless to say, sleeping in and relaxation was gone out of the window. We called the reception and they promised to stop. It didn't stop and continued endless to the point that around 10AM we gathered our belongings and left the room. Outside,  staring at our “private” pool were several workers on the roof so enjoying the pool or the beach  was out of question. The hotel manager offered us a free lunch which we respectfully declined because we came to relax and to sleep in not to have a mediocre free meal at over AED 3800 per night.  I simply asked for another stay when the construction was over and we could get exactly what we paid for. I wasn't interested in anything free- what I expected  was for the management to simply refund us the money for the stay they couldn't provide, move us to another villa away from the noise or offer a complimentary stay in the future to make up for a ruined holiday. None of these options were offered, none of our emails were answered and at this point we have decided to take this further. Yes, construction is something that will end eventually and this post may feel irrelevant. However, this is not about construction- this post is about terrible customer service when a client who paid in full and paid premium is placed into a situation where no resolution is offered and  any discomfort is not something the hotel is willing to take responsibility for. Inna situation where room is paid at check out - I would have never paid but because prepayment is required the hotel has nothing to lose.  This is not luxury - this is ignorance and if you are looking to spend your hard earned money - I would look at other options where your business is valued, appreciated  and where from the moment you step inside the hotel and up until  you leave - everything is catered to ensure you have a pleasant stay. Very disappointing and frustrating at the same time.\n\nUPDATE: After about three weeks and a couple of email exchanges our stay was refunded. We hope to come back for a different experience.",

Additionally, the buggy service was consistently late. The worst part was when they cut off the water supply for the entire night, a shocking 10-hour ordeal, and didn't bother to inform us until it was too late. The overall value for the money I paid was abysmal. The food was dry and tasteless, and the service was simply terrible. I would strongly advise against staying here.",

It is better to be early , 4 stands for ticket counters available.  But the crowd is massive. There are interesting artworks to see on the island\nThere are food trucks , restrooms, and prayer  areas  inside, along with benches, to relax\nNot stroller & Wheelchair friendly.\nThe walk is in sand hence Comfortable shoes are important.\nIt's about being patience as the queue gets long while waiting for the boat, but it's worth seeing .",
