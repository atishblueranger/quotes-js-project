It's really long, and there's quite a lot to walk. I would say this is a nice place to hang with friends or family once in a while.

It may not be the biggest mall in Dubai, but that's actually part of what makes it so enjoyable - it has a cozy, open layout with beautiful indoor spaces and waterfront views just outside.\n\nWhat really sets Marina Mall apart is the variety and uniqueness of its shops. Unlike the larger malls that tend to repeat the same big-name brands, this one mixes well-known labels with smaller boutique-style stores, giving you a more interesting shopping experience. Whether you're looking for fashion, gifts, or even just a relaxing coffee spot, you'll find something different here.\n\nIt's never overwhelmingly busy, and that calm vibe adds a lot to the experience. Great place for a peaceful walk, quality shopping, or a relaxed meal by the marina. Definitely worth visiting if you're in the area or looking for something a little more refined and easygoing than the massive retail hubs.",

You can find branches of all brands and brands here, but the prices are exorbitant. Naturally, it reflects the lifestyle of the wealthy. The mall is so large that it's impossible to explore it all in a single day. One of my favorite features was the ice rink in such a hot city. While the rink was crowded, it was still enjoyable to watch. The downside: everything in the food court is inspired by Indian cuisine, so everything is overly spicy, which made me very uncomfortable. I couldn't find anything that didn't smell or taste strange, and that I could eat with confidence. The mall was the cleanest and largest shopping mall I've ever seen.  It was truly an Arabian Paradise. It was incredibly crowded. There were so many Asian and Indian vendors. Frankly, most of them couldn't even understand English. The Asians weren't very friendly. The mall's location is perfect, and when you leave the mall, be prepared to see luxury cars. Everyone traveling to Dubai should definitely visit the Dubai Marina Mall.",

From the moment you walk in, the vibe is different: spacious, vibrant, and yet somehow relaxing.

You'll find everything, high-end fashion, daily essentials, quirky little stores, and restaurants that make you pause and think, “Should I try this today?” The food court alone feels like a mini world tour of cuisines.\n\nWhat I love most, though, is how effortless it all feels. The direct metro access, smooth parking, and clean, well-maintained interiors make visiting a breeze. It's rare to find a mall that combines convenience with such a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nFor me, BurJuman Mall is more than just a shopping spot, it's where you go when you want a mix of fun, comfort, and a little bit of discovery. Without hesitation, it's a 5-star place that always leaves you curious for the next visit.",

The architectural design is stunning, with each section dedicated to a different country, creating a unique and immersive atmosphere. Walking through the mall feels like taking a trip around the world, with each area perfectly capturing the essence and vibe of its respective country.\n\nOur visit was made even more memorable by the great time we had at Switch Bowling. It's a fantastic spot for some fun and friendly competition. The overall experience at Ibn Battuta Mall was truly \"wow,\" and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable day out in Dubai. Whether you're there for the shopping, the entertainment, or simply to soak in the incredible ambiance, Ibn Battuta Mall is a must-visit destination.",

The cinema here is also a plus for entertainment after shopping.\n\nThe mall is huge, and sometimes it takes a lot of walking to get from one end to another.

What I loved most is how easy it is to get there. It's directly connected to the Ibn Battuta Metro Station and also served by buses, so it's very convenient if you're using public transport.\n\nWhether you're shopping, sightseeing, or just looking for a cool indoor place to explore in Dubai, Ibn Battuta Mall is definitely worth a visit.

As the first modern shopping mall in the Middle East, Al Ghurair Centre holds a significant place in Dubai's history. Established in 1981 in Dubai's Deira district, it has grown to become a premier destination for both locals and tourists, seamlessly blending a rich heritage with contemporary offerings. In 2013, Al Ghurair Centre underwent a significant expansion, enhancing the visitor experience with the addition of 150 new stores, a world-class entertainment center, popular dining concepts, 60,000 square feet of office space, a serviced apartment complex, and a 5-star hotel with direct access to the center.\n\nAl Ghurair Centre boasts an impressive array of features, offering a comprehensive experience that extends beyond mere shopping. The mall is home to over 250 retail brands, providing an unparalleled shopping journey with a diverse selection of fashion, electronics, and home goods. Dining is a delight with more than 50 restaurants, including a dedicated Dining District and Food Court, catering to a wide range of culinary preferences, from international cuisine to Middle Eastern delights.\n\nFor entertainment, Al Ghurair Centre offers a state-of-the-art cinema with 18 screens, perfect for movie enthusiasts. Families can also enjoy attractions like Sparky's, which features an indoor skating rink, a roller coaster, and other exciting activities. Additionally, the mall features a captivating water show with a triple burst jet, adding a touch of spectacle and visual appeal. Al Ghurair Centre is truly a one-stop destination, and I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Dubai.",

Although the parking lot was quite crowded at first and it took some time to find a spot, we eventually managed to park. I was expecting the mall itself to be packed, but to my surprise, it wasn't.\n\nThe layout of the mall is well thought out-shops are neatly arranged, and there's enough space to keep the crowd flowing smoothly, with no congestion in any area. The wide variety of stores and food stalls makes it an excellent spot to visit and enjoy with your family.\n\nOverall, it's a well-maintained and enjoyable place to spend a few hours. I'd definitely recommend it for a relaxed family outings",

The variety of gold jewelry on display is absolutely stunning, everything from delicate chains to bold, intricate bridal sets. It truly lives up to Dubai's title as the “City of Gold.”\n\nThe prices are fair if you know how to negotiate, and most shops are willing to bargain, especially for making charges. I appreciate that the gold quality is government-regulated, which gives peace of mind when making a purchase.\n\nThe place can get crowded and a bit overwhelming, especially with some street vendors trying to sell fake watches or perfumes, but if you stick to the licensed shops, you'll be fine. Also, it's best to check the gold price before you go and bring cash for better deals.\n\nOverall, it's a must-visit for anyone who loves jewelry or wants to experience a vibrant part of Dubai's culture. I'll definitely come back!",

The customer service team is clueless and entirely reliant on their back-office teams, like marketing or others, to get anything done.

The lack of coordination and professionalism makes the entire experience frustrating and untrustworthy. It feels like there's something fishy about how they operate, and as a customer, you're left questioning their credibility.\n\nDefinitely not a place I would recommend unless they make significant improvements.",

Do all the calculations by yourself on your phone as well, sometimes its not what they write like the snapshot i added. The shopkeeper, after all the calculations, gave me 10850. But when i did calculations on my mobile, i got 10460. Upon asking, we did the calculations together, and we got 10460. And then the best thing he came up with was that it was a typo, a typo! We ended up buying from another shop.\n5. The best thing is that shopkeepers are not pushy, and they give all the time needed to make the sale.",

It's not a large mall and aiming to serve the community only, but it covers most daily needs quite well. There's a Carrefour for groceries, a few fashion and lifestyle stores like Miniso and Typo, and a mix of casual dining options and ice cream offers.\n\nThe atmosphere is generally quiet and relaxed, which makes it a comfortable place to grab a coffee or work. The cinema is a nice addition for families, and there are a few entertainment options for kids as well.\n\nParking is usually easy only weekends are quite busy, and the mall is pretty new and well-maintained. It serves its purpose well for nearby residents looking for convenience without the crowds.\n\nMy kids likes walking around in the mall and its quite safe and clean.",
