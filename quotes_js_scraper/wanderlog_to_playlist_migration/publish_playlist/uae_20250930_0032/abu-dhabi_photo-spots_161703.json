This MOSQUE is open to non-muslims, here people should wear decent clothes and ladies should cover their head.\n\nIt's constructed from White Marble and the carvings around it is just mind-blowing to see it. The architecture of the MOSQUE is very beautiful, it's really commendable how neat and clean they have maintained this huge MOSQUE hat's off to their effort in maintaining it. The white marble with gold carvings around the pillar and the entire structure, beautiful arches placed artistically is just mesmerizing to see.\n\nThe place is very peaceful you can feel it when you visit here. In some parts of the MOSQUE there is blue water pools along side of the huge number of beautifully carved pillars placed at equal distance. Words truly fall short to describe the beauty of this place, you need to come and feel it.\n\nIt's DIVINE experience visiting this MOSQUE. Here there is prayer hall where World's Largest Hand Weaven Carpet Is placed was awestruck to see that.\nHat's off to the Abu Dhabi and UAE for maintaining such a huge structure built with white marble, it looks and feels like as good as new but it's built decades ago.\n\nWhen we visit this MOSQUE got to see the UAE fighter jets flying around which was fantastic to see here.\nI say it's must visit place for people coming to Dubai.",

I'd highly recommend it to anyone visiting Abu Dhabi, especially if you love rollercoasters. The only downside was that it was hard to navigate the map and identify the different zones as they merged together, so we had to keep asking for directions to the rides and places we wanted to visit. Luckily the staff were really helpful. It would be great for more/better sign posts to different zones and main rides.",

The zoo is relatively small, but it's well-suited for kids and teens who are curious about animals and want to learn how to care for them properly.\n\nThere are scheduled live shows with the animals, which add a fun and educational element to the experience. The place is clean, well-maintained, and sanitized, which we really appreciated.\n\nOverall, a nice visit if you're looking for something wholesome and family-friendly!",

From the moment you enter, the peaceful surroundings and fresh sea breeze set the perfect tone for a relaxing nature walk. The well-maintained boardwalk makes it easy for kids and adults alike to explore the winding pathways through lush mangroves, all while being surrounded by calm waters and rich wildlife.\n\nOur family loved how educational and fun the experience was. The kids were thrilled to spot tiny crabs scuttling around, herons gliding gracefully, and fish darting through the shallow waters. Informative signboards along the trail added an extra layer of learning, helping us understand the importance of mangroves in preserving the local ecosystem.\n\nWhat makes Jubail Mangrove Park truly special is its peaceful atmosphere. Despite being close to the city, it feels like a complete escape into nature. There are plenty of rest areas along the trail where families can sit, enjoy the view, and even snap some great family photos.\n\nWe recommend visiting in the early morning or late afternoon when the weather is cooler. Don't forget hats, sunscreen, and plenty of water! Jubail Mangrove Park is a beautiful, family-friendly spot that combines fun, learning, and the beauty of nature all in one visit.",

Although the water is lower before summer, it's still a beautiful place to explore. There are scheduled boat tours throughout the day, or you can rent a boat for yourself or with friends. Golf cart tours are also available, and the mangrove area is quite large. Don't miss the observation tower-it offers a great view of both the city and the natural surroundings.",

Otherwise if you go from 8am to 4pm you're going to kayak through the main channel, which is also super nice so do it!!

The city boasts several pristine beaches, with some of the most popular being Corniche Beach, Saadiyat Beach, and the private beaches of luxury resorts like the Emirates Palace.\n\nCorniche Beach is the most accessible public beach, with well-maintained facilities, plenty of space, and stunning views of the turquoise waters of the Arabian Gulf. It's perfect for a leisurely day out, with a long walking and cycling path along the coastline, sunbeds for rent, and shaded areas. The beach is clean, family-friendly, and has a great vibe for relaxing, though it can get crowded during weekends and holidays.\n\nSaadiyat Beach, located on Saadiyat Island, is known for its natural beauty and quieter atmosphere. It has soft white sand and crystal-clear water, making it perfect for swimming and sunbathing. The beach is also home to some of the city's most luxurious resorts, but it is still accessible to the public. The surrounding nature, including mangroves and wildlife, adds to the serene vibe of Saadiyat Beach, though access might be limited to certain areas.\n\nFor those staying at luxury hotels or resorts like the St. Regis Saadiyat Island Resort, the Ritz-Carlton, or the Emirates Palace, you'll find private, exclusive beaches with impeccable service and stunning views. These spots provide great opportunities for water sports, beach clubs, and more.\n\nWhile Abu Dhabi's beaches are undoubtedly beautiful, the water temperature can be quite",

The stunning turquoise water never fails to draw you in, and the lifeguards on duty add an extra layer of safety, making it a great spot for all ages.\n\nOne of the standout features is the special access for wheelchairs, which is fantastic for ensuring that everyone can enjoy the beautiful beach. The showers and free drinking water stations are also a big plus, making it easy to rinse off and stay refreshed after a day in the sun.\n\nI absolutely love that you can bring your own food and drinks, which makes it perfect for a relaxing picnic by the water. There's also plenty of space to play sports-whether it's volleyball, frisbee, or any other fun outdoor activity, you'll find the perfect spot.\n\nOverall, Abu Dhabi Beach is a delightful destination that combines cleanliness, accessibility, and recreational opportunities.
