The beach itself is very clean, and I appreciate the presence of lifeguards constantly patrolling for safety. There's also a net for those who want to play beach volleyball, adding to the fun activities available. The toilets are well-maintained and designed to accommodate many visitors. Plus, the 5 AED entrance fee is absolutely worth it! Conveniently, there's a bus stop right at the entrance, making it easy to access. Highly recommended for a perfect day out!",

However, it's best to avoid visiting during peak traffic hours, as the area can get quite busy and the traffic can be a bit of a hassle.\n\nOverall, it's a lovely place to visit, just plan your timing accordingly!",
