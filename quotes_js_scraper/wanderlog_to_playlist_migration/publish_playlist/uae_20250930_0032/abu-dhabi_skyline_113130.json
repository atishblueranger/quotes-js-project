The white marble with gold carvings around the pillar and the entire structure, beautiful arches placed artistically is just mesmerizing to see.\n\nThe place is very peaceful you can feel it when you visit here. In some parts of the MOSQUE there is blue water pools along side of the huge number of beautifully carved pillars placed at equal distance. Words truly fall short to describe the beauty of this place, you need to come and feel it.\n\nIt's DIVINE experience visiting this MOSQUE. Here there is prayer hall where World's Largest Hand Weaven Carpet Is placed was awestruck to see that.\nHat's off to the Abu Dhabi and UAE for maintaining such a huge structure built with white marble, it looks and feels like as good as new but it's built decades ago.\n\nWhen we visit this MOSQUE got to see the UAE fighter jets flying around which was fantastic to see here.\nI say it's must visit place for people coming to Dubai.",

We truly enjoyed all the attractions, especially The Green Lantern: Galactic Odyssey and The Bedrock River Adventure. The park is well-designed, bringing the world of Warner Bros. to life in an exciting way.\n\nThe only downside is the food pricing. Similar to my recent visit to SeaWorld Abu Dhabi, the food courts here are extremely expensive. A simple Mountain Dew costs 18 AED-almost triple the usual price. While I understand the cost of maintaining such a fantastic theme park, I hope they consider making food and drinks more affordable for visitors.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful experience, and I highly recommend it for families looking for a fun-filled day!",

The team are very friendly and helpful. The fay we went wasn't a busy day, so the wait times were optimal and we didn't need to wait more than 10 min for any ride. The park is clean, they have a variety of merchandise and the characters are reals to the character. What i feel was missing is the ambiance, the music and shows.",

I'd highly recommend it to anyone visiting Abu Dhabi, especially if you love rollercoasters. The only downside was that it was hard to navigate the map and identify the different zones as they merged together, so we had to keep asking for directions to the rides and places we wanted to visit. Luckily the staff were really helpful. It would be great for more/better sign posts to different zones and main rides.",

Standing there with the view of the Grand Mosque in the background truly gives you goosebumps.\n\nA perfect place to pause, reflect, and pay tribute to the heroes of the UAE.

The guided tour was engaging, the staff were kind, and everything was well organized.\n\nHowever, there is one important detail future visitors should be aware of:\nTo enter the Islamic section (the mosque), you must remove your shoes, as per tradition. Unfortunately, there is no prior notice about this, and no place on-site to purchase shoe covers or socks.\n\nThis could be inconvenient or even problematic for visitors who have skin conditions or simply prefer not to walk barefoot in public spaces. It would be great if the management could consider offering disposable socks or covers for shoes.\n\nOther than that - an incredible experience. Highly recommended!",

Under the roof, three 45m towers are used as support, which are equally as cunning in their cricket-themed architecture because they represent the three stumps of a wicket.",

The sheer scale of the stadium, with its vast green field and towering stands, was awe-inspiring. Walking onto the pitch, I felt a surge of excitement and anticipation, as if I were stepping into the shoes of professional cricketers who have graced this ground before.\n\nThe match began with an electrifying atmosphere. The sound of bat meeting ball and the sight of players running across the field brought the game to life. As I took my place on the team, a mix of nerves and adrenaline coursed through me. Every moment on the field was intense-whether it was batting, bowling, or fielding. The thrill of hitting a boundary, taking a wicket, or stopping a crucial run was unmatched.\n\nThe camaraderie with my teammates added to the joy of the day. From strategizing on the field to sharing laughs during breaks, the match was not just about competition but also about bonding and teamwork. The opposing team played with great spirit, making the contest even more engaging and challenging.\n\nThe stadium, with its vibrant energy, made every moment memorable. The cheers from spectators, even if few, added to the competitive spirit and gave me a taste of what it might feel like to play in front of a packed audience.\n\nBy the end of the match, I was exhausted but thoroughly satisfied. Win or lose, the experience of playing cricket in a professional stadium was an unforgettable one. It was a reminder of the joy of sports, the value of teamwork, and the sheer fun of being part of a thrilling game.",

Elevation in geometric patterns, consists of over 1000 moving elements that shrink and expand during the day, depending on the position of the sun, providing a more dynamic solution to climatic conditions. The panel lattice almost completely surrounds the two towers, except for the part of the buildings that faces north.\n\nThe shading system developed by a team of computer designers, architects and engineers is based on a parametric description of the geometry of the moving facades and simulation of its functions in response to sun exposure and the resulting change in incidence angles to different points throughout the year. Since in Abu Dhabi the temperature rarely drops below 35 * C and for much of the year it exceeds 50 * C, it was considered that in addition to investing in the building's air conditioning, it is also necessary to limit the heating of its interior.\n\nThe dynamic response of the panels to the movement of the sun, solar radiation inside the building, filters the light and reduces glare. At night, all the screens are curled up, allowing the glass of the facade to be seen. The system was named \"mashrabiya\" from traditional openwork architectural elements characteristic of Arab buildings since the Middle Ages.",

What made it even more special was the surprise birthday cake they brought out for me-it completely caught me off guard and made the experience truly unforgettable.

The décor is stunning-floral installations, golden details, and soft lighting create a peaceful, luxurious atmosphere.\n\nOur waiter from Indonesia was incredibly warm and attentive, and the food was both beautifully presented and delicious. The savoury bites were creative and elegant, and the sweet treats were just as indulgent. The tea selection is extensive, but the star of the show was the golden cappuccino-smooth, rich, and topped with edible gold.\n\nWe recommend booking at least two days in advance with pre-payment to secure your spot. It's a magical experience-perfect for families, special occasions, or anyone needing a golden pause in their week.",
