But the ticket price is too high (₹300 per person) for what you get.\n\nThe place is clean and maintained okay, but the overall vibe is just average - nothing special or wow. Feels more like a quick visit place, not something you'd go back to again.\n\nWould recommend only if you're visiting with children or want to see it once for the tunnel. For solo travelers or couples, it may feel overpriced and underwhelming.\n\nPros: Good for kids, colorful fish, underwater tunnel\nCons: Overpriced tickets, small area, normal",

It' must be arranged ASAP.\n\nBags and camera like DSLR will not allowed.\nFree baggage counter available after entering.\n\nThe museum also does a great job showcasing the rich history of Indian Railways. From vintage locomotives to old photographs and railway artifacts, there's a lot to see and learn. It's a nostalgic journey through time and well-curated for history lovers.\n\nOne area for improvement is the cafeteria, where prices are noticeably higher than the MRP.

It's not your typical sterile shopping experience; it's raw, it's bustling, and it's full of life.\nThe first thing that hits you is the explosion of colors and smells. Piles upon piles of bright fruits and vegetables are everywhere – the deep red of tomatoes, the vibrant yellow of bananas, the lush green of leafy vegetables. And the fragrance? A mix of sweet flowers, earthy spices, and fresh produce all mingling together. It's quite intoxicating!\nWhat I loved is how authentic it feels. You see local vendors, many of whom have been there for generations, passionately selling their goods. There's a real buzz of interaction between them and the customers, a friendly banter that you don't often find in modern supermarkets.\nYou can find pretty much anything here, from fresh produce and flowers (oh, the marigolds and jasmine are just gorgeous!) to spices, incense, and even some household items. It's a feast for the senses at every turn.\nNavigating through the narrow pathways can be a bit chaotic, with people and handcarts moving around, but that's part of its charm. It feels like you're right in the heart of the city's everyday life.\nI spent a good amount of time just wandering around, taking it all in. I bought some fragrant spices and a few local fruits that I hadn't tried before. It felt good to support the local economy directly.\nIt's not a fancy, air-conditioned mall; it's a traditional market, and it has all the character that comes with that. If you want to experience the real pulse of Mysore and soak in the local culture, Devaraja Market is a must-visit. Just be prepared for the crowds and the sensory overload – embrace it, and you'll have a fantastic time!\nIn a human way:\n* It's a vibrant and bustling market with an explosion of colors and smells.\n* You can find a wide variety of fresh produce, flowers, and spices.\n* It feels very authentic, with local vendors and lively interactions.\n* It's a great place to experience the local culture and support the community.\n* Be prepared for crowds and a sensory-rich environment.\nIf you're looking for an authentic and lively experience in Mysore, Devaraja Market is definitely worth exploring.

            "text": "It is one of the best zoos of the country.Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens, popularly known as ‘Mysuru Zoo', is one of the oldest zoos of the country established in 1892, by His Highness, the erstwhile Ruler of Mysuru Sri Chamarajendra Wadiyar Bahadur. Mysuru Zoo holds an important place in Karnataka. In 1909 the Palace Zoo was named as Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens to commemorate the illustrious founder and since then it bears the nomenclature. Mysuru Zoo has gradually grown into tourist centre, imparting wildlife values. It has got 123 years of history exhibiting wild animals in the near natural enclosures. Despite majority of the zoos have been shifted from the original place to the new places, Mysuru Zoo could modernize the zoo, without shifting the zoo. The zoo is well compacted unit, with modern animal enclosures including heritage buildings attracting tourists all over the world.Great place to visit with kids above 5 years, they really appreciate the variety of birds, animals and reptiles. It took us 4 hours to complete the walk around the entire Zoo, which included a 30 min break at the cafeteria, just to rest. The food at the cafeteria is primarily south Indian food, which didn't intrigue us much, since we were eating the same for the last couple of days. Make sure you wear the most comfortable shoes if you plan to walk, and carry a bottle, so you can fill it up at the watering stations, which are well spaced out, carry a cap, it's not too hot though cause of all the trees. There is also a buggy option, however they cover the entire Zoo in an hour and you don't get time to spend at each exhibit, it's a quick tour. The zoo doesn't permit plastics, or outside food, they check the bags at the entrance post buying your tickets.",

The zoo is clean, well-maintained, and thoughtfully organized with separate sections for birds, reptiles, wild animals, and more. Visitors can explore the zoo on foot, covering approximately 3 kilometers, or opt for electric buggies for convenience. I will recommend it by foot if you can make it, so you can manage where to spend time. The entry fee is ₹100 per person. The lush greenery throughout the zoo provides a soothing and refreshing atmosphere. The walkways are beautifully designed, making the visit even more enjoyable.  It's a must-visit destination, especially for families with kids, offering a unique and memorable experience to spend quality time together.",
