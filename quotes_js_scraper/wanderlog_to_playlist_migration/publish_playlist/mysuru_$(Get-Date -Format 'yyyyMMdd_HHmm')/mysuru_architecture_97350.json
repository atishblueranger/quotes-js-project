The moment you step through the grand gates, you're transported into the royal world of the Wadiyar dynasty. The architecture is absolutely stunning – a perfect blend of Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic styles that will leave you speechless.\n\nInside, every hall is more magnificent than the last, with stained glass ceilings, intricately carved doors, and royal artifacts that tell the story of Mysore's glorious past. The Kalyana Mantapa (wedding hall) is a true highlight with its colorful peacock-themed ceiling and chandeliers.\n\nBut the real magic begins in the evening – when the entire palace is illuminated with thousands of lights, it looks like a golden dream come alive! If you get the chance, don't miss the light and sound show – it beautifully narrates the history of the palace.\n\nWhether you're a history lover, architecture enthusiast, or a casual traveler, this place is a must-visit. It's clean, well-maintained, and rich in culture.\n\n✅ Stunning interiors\n✅ Great for photography\n✅ Rich historical experience\n✅ Evening lighting is a visual treat\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nOne of the best royal palaces in India. A visit you'll always remember!",

It's not your typical sterile shopping experience; it's raw, it's bustling, and it's full of life.\nThe first thing that hits you is the explosion of colors and smells. Piles upon piles of bright fruits and vegetables are everywhere – the deep red of tomatoes, the vibrant yellow of bananas, the lush green of leafy vegetables. And the fragrance? A mix of sweet flowers, earthy spices, and fresh produce all mingling together. It's quite intoxicating!\nWhat I loved is how authentic it feels. You see local vendors, many of whom have been there for generations, passionately selling their goods. There's a real buzz of interaction between them and the customers, a friendly banter that you don't often find in modern supermarkets.\nYou can find pretty much anything here, from fresh produce and flowers (oh, the marigolds and jasmine are just gorgeous!) to spices, incense, and even some household items. It's a feast for the senses at every turn.\nNavigating through the narrow pathways can be a bit chaotic, with people and handcarts moving around, but that's part of its charm. It feels like you're right in the heart of the city's everyday life.\nI spent a good amount of time just wandering around, taking it all in. I bought some fragrant spices and a few local fruits that I hadn't tried before. It felt good to support the local economy directly.\nIt's not a fancy, air-conditioned mall; it's a traditional market, and it has all the character that comes with that. If you want to experience the real pulse of Mysore and soak in the local culture, Devaraja Market is a must-visit. Just be prepared for the crowds and the sensory overload – embrace it, and you'll have a fantastic time!\nIn a human way:\n* It's a vibrant and bustling market with an explosion of colors and smells.\n* You can find a wide variety of fresh produce, flowers, and spices.\n* It feels very authentic, with local vendors and lively interactions.\n* It's a great place to experience the local culture and support the community.\n* Be prepared for crowds and a sensory-rich environment.\nIf you're looking for an authentic and lively experience in Mysore, Devaraja Market is definitely worth exploring.

Also known as Subbarayanakere Park, it is one of the places to visit in Mysore.\n\nFreedom Fighter's Park was built to commemorate the 'Mysore Chalo' movement, one of the most significant events in the history of Mysuru which resulted in the establishment of a democratic government in Mysore. Freedom fighters assembled at this very spot, launching a resistance movement when the Maharaja of Mysore retained the rule of the state. As a part of the protest, the Indian flag was hoisted every day at this park by freedom fighters, which eventually made the Maharaja surrender to the demand for democracy in 1947.\n\nIt is a huge park known for its unmatched beauty, lush green lawns, and bright flower beds. The major attractions of the park are the captivating and magnificent statues of the freedom fighters including Mahatma Gandhi. The park also has a separate play area for kids and space for yoga, meditation, etc. Revisit the scenes of India's struggle to become a democracy amidst nature's beauty at this park as part of Mysore tour packages.",

The walking path is well-maintained, and benches are available along the way to sit and take in the view. It's also a fantastic location for photography-especially during the migratory season when a variety of birds flock to the lake. Birdwatchers and nature photographers will really enjoy it. The surroundings are calm and refreshing, making it a great escape from the city's chaos. Having clean and accessible washrooms would further enhance the visitor experience, but overall, it's a beautiful and worth visiting.",

            "text": "When Scholars felt the need to collect, and preserve Sanskrit and Kannada palm leaf and Manuscripts, the idea of establishing an institution in the name of ‘Oriental Library' came in their mind and that resulted in its establishment by Maharaja Sri Chamaraja Wadeyar in 1891. Mysore University was started in 1916. Since then ‘Oriental Library' became an integral part of Mysore University. Its objects are to collect, preserve, edit and publish the rare valuable Sanskrit and Kannada palm leaf as well as Paper Manuscripts available in our country. Later in 1943 ‘Oriental Library' was renamed as ‘Oriental Research Institute'.\nIt is managed and administered by Director and staff. It has compiled and published ‘Sritattvanidhi' of Sri Mummadi Krishnaraja Wadeyar, in three Volumes, comprising of Shakthi Nidhi, Vishnu Nidhi and Shiva Nidhi, apart from many other rare Sanskrit works. It has to its credit vast number of collection exceeding a lakh. Its library, as I have seen, contains more than 50,000 books in Sanskrit, Kannada, English, Hindi and other languages. It is an internationally recognised institution getting financial aid from USA and others.\nInfact Oriental Library was the first public library in Mysore that was dedicated to the cause of research and editing of manuscripts, keeping Indology as its prime focus. It has published nearly 200 titles from 1893 till date. It has preserved in its womb a rich collection of more than 75000 ancient, rare and highly valued materials, books and documents. I can quote some important and rare collections like Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics by James Hastings, Vedic Concordance by Maurice Bloomfield and critical editions of Ramayana and Mahabharata. I could not find any difficulty to pick the book of choice because the books are systematically arranged to have easy access to reader's desired books and documents.\nThe palm leaves manuscripts are of standard size of 15cm x 3.5cm. These are extraordinary manuscripts that open an unusual window to literature, philosophy, astrology, religious practices and languages that were in vogue in primordial times. Manuscripts are organic materials at risk of decay and destruction by Silverfish. Lemon grass oil is applied on manuscripts to preserve them. Lemon grass oil actually injects natural fluidity into the brittle palm leaves and hydrophobic nature of oil keeps the manuscripts dry and the text is not lost due to humidity. Conventional method is adopted to preserve manuscripts in microfilm. Original manuscripts are available for reference. ‘The Emperor's Riddles' authored by Satyarth Nayak was featured by it in 2014. It is a mystery thriller novel as I have seen. I have visited this library several times.\nOriental Institute is a treasure trove for knowledge seekers and research students and scholars, having preserved several greatest works of literature, philosophy, religion and what not! Visitors are allowed to see the palm leaf and paper manuscripts. It has preserved not only the rare manuscripts safely but also makes them available for research purposes. The name itself suggests its commitments to propagate Indian culture and heritage. It has been encouraging and furthering Indological research all these years from its inception. It is in reality a museum displaying 50,000 ancient palm-leaf manuscripts and later manuscripts in paper.\nOriental Institute is found at northern end of Krishnaraja Boulevard Road. It is adjacently opposite to Crawford Hall and within the campus of Mysore University. Its building is architecturally beautiful and attracts viewers from a distance. It is actually the Jubilee Hall built in 1887 to commemorate golden jubilee of Queen Victoria`s taking over British throne.\nIt is kept open for public from 8am to 8pm on all days.

He was humble and polite. He asked me to visit office and on the same day I visited the office on the agreed time. He explained me everything, took my details and finally said, he would send out the details on email about the rates and procedures. Though I followed up aggressively, I have not got any sort of response from him.\n\nMy final conclusion is that, instead of wasting my time along with his time, if he is not able to take project due to whatever reason, he should have been upfront and honest. Being in the industry for so long, they are lagging of the professionalism.\n\nSo anyone out there, before approaching this architect, be prepared that, they may go absconding or they may not entertain you for various reasons which even they don't tell you.
