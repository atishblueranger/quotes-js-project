In 1909 the Palace Zoo was named as Sri Chamarajendra Zoological Gardens to commemorate the illustrious founder and since then it bears the nomenclature. Mysuru Zoo has gradually grown into tourist centre, imparting wildlife values. It has got 123 years of history exhibiting wild animals in the near natural enclosures. Despite majority of the zoos have been shifted from the original place to the new places, Mysuru Zoo could modernize the zoo, without shifting the zoo. The zoo is well compacted unit, with modern animal enclosures including heritage buildings attracting tourists all over the world.Great place to visit with kids above 5 years, they really appreciate the variety of birds, animals and reptiles. It took us 4 hours to complete the walk around the entire Zoo, which included a 30 min break at the cafeteria, just to rest. The food at the cafeteria is primarily south Indian food, which didn't intrigue us much, since we were eating the same for the last couple of days. Make sure you wear the most comfortable shoes if you plan to walk, and carry a bottle, so you can fill it up at the watering stations, which are well spaced out, carry a cap, it's not too hot though cause of all the trees. There is also a buggy option, however they cover the entire Zoo in an hour and you don't get time to spend at each exhibit, it's a quick tour. The zoo doesn't permit plastics, or outside food, they check the bags at the entrance post buying your tickets."

The zoo is clean, well-maintained, and thoughtfully organized with separate sections for birds, reptiles, wild animals, and more. Visitors can explore the zoo on foot, covering approximately 3 kilometers, or opt for electric buggies for convenience. I will recommend it by foot if you can make it, so you can manage where to spend time. The entry fee is ₹100 per person. The lush greenery throughout the zoo provides a soothing and refreshing atmosphere. The walkways are beautifully designed, making the visit even more enjoyable.  It's a must-visit destination, especially for families with kids, offering a unique and memorable experience to spend quality time together."

No food allowed inside the zoo but they have filtered water taps inside. restrooms are there however they are not clean and I dont blame the staff completely, I saw them cleaning but people have hard time maintaining cleanliness in public space in our country. But overall you will have a fun family time, especially kids are going to love to see the animals."

A lot of the palace area is restricted for visitors but the area accessible by the visitors make you drop your jaw while you endure its legacy. It’s beautiful, architecture is outstanding and the beautifully restored walls. I’d highly recommend anyone visiting Bangalore of Mysore to visit this place, you’d not regret your time. The entry ticket is ₹120 per person and there’s ample parking space outside. There’s also toilets after the entry and some food outlets as well. A lot of street vendors outside the palace are selling souvenirs, snacks and everything that you might need for a quick bite."

Horse cart ride is highly recommended, the long round covers the route around the beautifully lit up palace in the evening covering all 5 palace gates."

The light show happens daily from 7 to 8pm and it is free to enter and see no ticket. You may have to pay for parking though. There are many shops all around to buy eatables and toys and other things like crafts, collectables, etc. It is nice good for taking a walk near a scenic and beautiful place."

In fact, I personally feel that the young and old can benefit in achieving a better understanding of India’s efforts in preservation of its own waters/soils.\n\nSimplicity is the key to telling and advocating its objectives. Crafts were done neatly and I liked their creativity. Nothing too fancy but just basic.\n\nI didn’t realise that there are still many tribal members in India, let alone the different types of spoken languages.\n\nThere were a few different  halls, each exhibiting different topics.\n\nI liked their creativity as well as the information shared. The caretakers were friendly, they encouraged me to touch & feel the artefacts in the hall where the skulls of elephant / giraffe / dolphin were displayed.\n\nDefinitely pleased to have visited this down-to-earth museum. It does take quite an effort to maintain it and thank you for that. Great job!\n\nEntry is FOC."

One of the main highlights is the toy train ride, which is a fun experience for both children and adults. It adds a playful touch to the visit and gives a mini-tour of the museum grounds. The toy train fee is included in the entry ticket itself. They will tear the toy train ticket at entry to train.\nEntry fee is little higher for kids as well adult.\nRs. 50 for adults and Rs. 20 for kids (5 to 12 years)\nWe will spend around 1.5 hours in a museum.\n\nThey have NOT  provided Drinking water for visitors. It' must be arranged ASAP.\n\nBags and camera like DSLR will not allowed.\nFree baggage counter available after entering.\n\nThe museum also does a great job showcasing the rich history of Indian Railways. From vintage locomotives to old photographs and railway artifacts, there’s a lot to see and learn. It's a nostalgic journey through time and well-curated for history lovers.\n\nOne area for improvement is the cafeteria, where prices are noticeably higher than the MRP. It would be great if the authorities could look into this to make it more reasonable for visitors.\n\nOverall, it’s a great spot to spend a couple of hours, especially if you enjoy trains or want to show kids something different and educational."

It showcases a linear progression that we as humans have made in locomotive sector. It's a very good spot for taking photos as well as to introduce kids to the history of railway system. You can also take a toy train ride for ₹50/- per person, even though it is for a very short distance. They have a cafeteria inside. Every corners of the museum felt picturesque and relaxing. It literally felt like someone has placed these beautiful vintage trains in a park. They have also preserved royal carriages with all the facilities inside."

It’s not just for railway lovers, even if you’re not into trains, the exhibits are fascinating.\n\nYou get to see vintage locomotives, old carriages, and even the royal train coaches that were once used by the Mysore Maharajas. Walking around gives you a glimpse of how rail travel looked decades ago.\n\nThe museum is very well maintained, with lots of open space, greenery, and photo spots. Kids especially love climbing into the engines and exploring. There’s also a mini toy train ride that adds to the fun.\n\nIt usually doesn’t take more than 1–2 hours to cover the museum, and the entry fee is quite reasonable. Mornings or evenings are the best time to visit, since afternoons can be hot.\n\nOverall, it’s a unique and enjoyable experience in Mysuru, a perfect mix of history, nostalgia, and family fun.\n\nParking: Free, Limited.\nRestroom: Available\nEntry ticket for Adult & Kids\nRestaurant available\n\nAmazing place to spend time with Family and Kids."

The museum is having so many things related to railway like how the things started and what is the present technology used etc. Good for kids as well.

The best wet rides are Freefall, Aqua Tornado, Super Drop & Loop, Pendulum, Aqua Rider and Blizzard Ride. The Amazonia and Great RedIndian Falls are great.\nThere are rides for both young and adults.\nMultiple food stalls with variety of options are available.\nFew thing that I would like to request is, 1) Information about the availability of first-aid and where and whom to approach, should be given while entering the park.\n2) The website needs to updated with information about all the new rides and updated map."

It is very small, with very less activities, plus, the boots they give you at the entrance are rain boots, not snow boots and after only 5 minutes inside we were feeling really cold."

Feels more like a quick visit place, not something you’d go back to again.\n\nWould recommend only if you're visiting with children or want to see it once for the tunnel.

The aquarium is home to a wide variety of fascinating marine life, with beautifully designed tanks that offer clear views of colorful fish, graceful rays, and majestic turtles. The thematic layout and creative displays make the journey enjoyable for both kids and adults, sparking curiosity about aquatic ecosystems and species.\n\nOne of the highlights was the underwater tunnel, which lets you feel surrounded by aquatic creatures swimming overhead—a truly immersive experience. The zoo also offers informative boards and interactive sessions that helped deepen our understanding of marine conservation. The friendly staff were always ready to answer questions and guide visitors, adding warmth to the visit.\n\nThe only reason I’m giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that a few sections felt a bit crowded, and there could be more seating areas to relax between exhibits. However, overall, Lokaranjan Aqua World is a fantastic place for a family outing, school trip, or a casual exploration. I left with a smile and would certainly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and educational stop in the city!"

The entry fee is surprisingly high, and once inside, there isn’t much to see compared to what one would expect for the price charged.\n\nThe collection of aquatic species is very limited, and the displays feel poorly maintained. For families, especially those with kids, it can be disappointing because the excitement and curiosity fade very quickly after entering. The space feels small, and the variety of fish and marine life showcased does not justify the hefty ticket cost.\n\nMysuru has so many wonderful attractions, but sadly, Lokaranjan Aqua World does not live up to expectations. Unless it undergoes significant improvement in terms of exhibits and maintenance, it’s hard to recommend this place, especially when better experiences are available elsewhere in the city."

It took about 2–4 hours to cover fully depending on how you want to cover.\n\nHighly recommended for families, kids, and nature lovers.

The animal enclosures are neat and tidy, and it’s nice to see that the animals are kept in good care. It’s also a lovely spot for kids – they really enjoy seeing such a wide variety of animals up close. The only thing that could be improved is the canteen, which was a bit disappointing compared to the overall standard of the zoo. Otherwise, it’s definitely a place worth visiting when in Mysore."

Enclosures feel spacious, the collection is superb (great apes, big cats, giraffes), and the paths are shaded with plenty of drinking-water points. Staff are efficient, battery buggies/wheelchairs help elders, and the plastic-free policy is a big plus. It gets crowded on weekends and the loop is long, so wear comfy shoes. Overall: a fantastic family outing and wildlife lover’s stop.\n\nPro tip: Go early for active animals, then wind down at nearby Karanji Lake."

You can see all kinds of animals here—from big cats and elephants to birds and reptiles. Every creature looked healthy and well taken care of, which made the visit even more enjoyable.\n\n🚶‍♂️ Size & Time: The zoo is huge. Be ready for a lot of walking—it takes time to cover everything, so go with full energy and comfy shoes.\n\n🚗 Transport Option: They do offer internal transport, but the wait was too long, so we skipped it. Might be useful if you’re visiting with elders or small kids, but plan accordingly.\n\n🎉 For Kids: It’s a paradise! Kids will absolutely love seeing the animals up close and the wide open spaces to explore.\n\n💚 Reminder: Please be kind to the animals. Don’t tap on enclosures or try to feed them—just enjoy observing!\n\n📷 Bonus Tip: Great spots for family photos along the way!"

It's an excellent opportunity to see a wide variety of animals.\nWe considered the battery car, but I'm glad we decided against it. As some have mentioned, it's not the best way to experience the zoo. You'll miss most of the details and close-up views of the animals, which is the main reason to go. Walking around is definitely the way to go, even with kids.\nA definite highlight was the Karanji Lake. The boating experience was a fantastic memory and a welcome break from walking. It's a must-do for anyone visiting.\nThe one major drawback, however, is the food situation. Food is not allowed inside, which is understandable, but the on-site restaurant is quite disappointing. The quality and variety were poor, making it difficult to refuel after a long walk. It would be a huge improvement if they had a food court with multiple vendors offering a better selection of refreshing drinks and meals.\nOverall, it's a great place for a family outing, but be prepared for the food court frustration. Plan your visit accordingly, perhaps by eating a large meal before or after you go."

This place is truly a gem for anyone who loves nature, wildlife, or just wants to spend a peaceful and entertaining day outdoors. The zoo is very big and extremely well-maintained, making it one of the best zoos I’ve visited in India.\n\nThe variety of animals here is genuinely impressive. From elephants, giraffes, and rhinos to big cats like cheetahs, leopards, and even a majestic black panther — the zoo is home to a wide range of species. What stood out the most was how close you can get to these animals (safely, of course). Seeing these creatures up close was a very unique and unforgettable experience.\n\nThe zoo also has a large section dedicated to reptiles and birds. Although there was a bit of crowding near the reptile section, it was still manageable and didn't take away from the experience. You’ll find crocodiles, snakes, and many fascinating species that are not commonly seen elsewhere.\n\nOne of the most entertaining parts of the visit was watching the monkeys play. They swing around on ropes and entertain visitors with their antics — fun for both kids and adults alike. We were also thrilled to see a gorilla, which is quite rare in Indian zoos.\n\nThe environment inside the zoo is clean, green, and well-organized. Safety measures are in place throughout the zoo, and the staff seem to be doing a good job managing both animals and visitors. There are plenty of signboards, shaded walking paths, and resting spots to make your visit comfortable.\n\nAs for the ticket prices, they are quite reasonable. It’s ₹120 per person if you choose to walk, and ₹240 per person if you take the battery-operated vehicle. The battery vehicle is a good option if you're visiting with elderly people or young children, and it accommodates about 8 people at a time.\n\nOverall, the Mysore Zoo offers a perfect blend of education, entertainment, and relaxation. Whether you're a tourist or a local resident, this place should definitely be on your list. Highly recommended for a fun-filled day with family or friends!"

There are fountains, beautifully sculpted models, loving and cute animals, well designed gardens and all that an ideal park must contain. The perfect place you would want to visit to lift you mood and escape into heaven. Must visit place with family or friends for the perfect little picnic.\n\nAs the name suggests this is really the 'sanjeevini' for mental stress. The park is in the idea location with not too much distance from the outside environment. You can't hear the busy noice of the city roads.You can't feel the presence of any other being and it's just wonderful. The calm breeze just makes you forget everything."

Worst part, they allow smoking in the dining area despite the presence of families and kids. They do have a designated smoking area which seems to be for namesake. Bringing up this issue gave us lot of backlash from the waiter! No sense of hospitality. Food wasn't great either. The owner should either take care of this or better shut the place. Passive smoking is inevitable with them."

However, a fresh perspective on its promotional strategies could enhance its visibility.  A reevaluation of the pricing structure might also broaden its appeal.  There's untapped potential waiting to be discovered within its walls.  Small changes can make a significant difference in attracting a wider audience.  It's a gem that deserves to shine brighter.  With some thoughtful adjustments, it could truly flourish."

The vibe is unmatched — dim lighting, iconic posters, and a killer playlist of classic and modern rock that instantly sets the mood.

Their cocktails and beer options are solid, and the food complements the drinks perfectly — try the chicken starters, they're a hit.\n\nWhether you're going with friends or just looking for a place to unwind with good music, Purple Haze delivers. It’s a must-visit if you’re in Mysore and want to soak in some old-school rock vibes."

It's not your typical sterile shopping experience; it's raw, it's bustling, and it's full of life.\nThe first thing that hits you is the explosion of colors and smells. Piles upon piles of bright fruits and vegetables are everywhere – the deep red of tomatoes, the vibrant yellow of bananas, the lush green of leafy vegetables. And the fragrance? A mix of sweet flowers, earthy spices, and fresh produce all mingling together. It’s quite intoxicating!\nWhat I loved is how authentic it feels. You see local vendors, many of whom have been there for generations, passionately selling their goods. There's a real buzz of interaction between them and the customers, a friendly banter that you don't often find in modern supermarkets.\nYou can find pretty much anything here, from fresh produce and flowers (oh, the marigolds and jasmine are just gorgeous!) to spices, incense, and even some household items. It’s a feast for the senses at every turn.\nNavigating through the narrow pathways can be a bit chaotic, with people and handcarts moving around, but that's part of its charm. It feels like you're right in the heart of the city's everyday life.\nI spent a good amount of time just wandering around, taking it all in. I bought some fragrant spices and a few local fruits that I hadn't tried before. It felt good to support the local economy directly.\nIt's not a fancy, air-conditioned mall; it's a traditional market, and it has all the character that comes with that. If you want to experience the real pulse of Mysore and soak in the local culture, Devaraja Market is a must-visit. Just be prepared for the crowds and the sensory overload – embrace it, and you'll have a fantastic time!\nIn a human way:\n* It's a vibrant and bustling market with an explosion of colors and smells.\n* You can find a wide variety of fresh produce, flowers, and spices.\n* It feels very authentic, with local vendors and lively interactions.\n* It's a great place to experience the local culture and support the community.\n* Be prepared for crowds and a sensory-rich environment.\nIf you're looking for an authentic and lively experience in Mysore, Devaraja Market is definitely worth exploring. It's a sensory adventure!"

Perched atop Chamundi Hills, the temple offers breathtaking views of the city below. The intricate architecture and vibrant decorations make it a must-visit for devotees and tourists alike. The majestic Nandi statue at the foothills is equally impressive, symbolizing devotion and strength. The temple's history and mythology are palpable, and the serene atmosphere provides a perfect setting for reflection. A truly enriching experience that showcases the rich cultural heritage of Karnataka.\""

The roads are wide and smooth, making the drive or ride genuinely enjoyable.\n\nHeads up on footwear storage:\n\nSome shops near the parking will try to tell you there’s no shoe storage at the top — don’t believe them. It’s just a way to get you to buy pooja items so they can “watch” your footwear.\n\nTruth is, there’s proper footwear storage available right near the temple entrance, with a ₹5 token system — safe, easy, and no pressure to buy anything.\n\nEntry options:\n\n1. ₹100 – Front gate (quickest)\n\n2. ₹30 – Side entry (bit of a line but manageable)\n\nThey do not accept online payments, so carry cash.\n\nAlso, you’ll find washrooms and a few refreshment stalls nearby in case you need a quick bite or drink post-darshan."

Located in the heart of Mysore city, the palace has been holding its charm ever since it was constructed decades ago. Each section of the palace speaks out its legacy of the royal family and their importance in the Mysore dynasty and the Bangalore history. A lot of the palace area is restricted for visitors but the area accessible by the visitors make you drop your jaw while you endure its legacy. It’s beautiful, architecture is outstanding and the beautifully restored walls. I’d highly recommend anyone visiting Bangalore of Mysore to visit this place, you’d not regret your time. The entry ticket is ₹120 per person and there’s ample parking space outside. There’s also toilets after the entry and some food outlets as well. A lot of street vendors outside the palace are selling souvenirs, snacks and everything that you might need for a quick bite."

The light show happens daily from 7 to 8pm and it is free to enter and see no ticket. You may have to pay for parking though. There are many shops all around to buy eatables and toys and other things like crafts, collectables, etc. It is nice good for taking a walk near a scenic and beautiful place."

For years, during every function, celebration, or special occasion, we have chosen only KSIC sarees from KSIC FROM MYSORE It’s something we hold close to our hearts, and we never look elsewhere.\n\nHowever, it’s deeply disappointing that every time we visit the store, we face the same recurring issue no proper stock or collections, and often very limited choices. Today was no different. Despite our excitement and anticipation, we once again left disheartened. There’s barely any fresh production, and even the staff on duty don’t seem very motivated to help or show the sarees available. We had to wait in long queues, and it honestly didn’t feel like the warm, welcoming experience it used to be.\n\nAs loyal customers, we request the management to look into this seriously. It’s not just about buying a saree — for us, it’s about continuing a cherished family tradition. We hope you’ll take this feedback constructively and bring back the magic of KSIC that we’ve always known and loved."

The moment you step through the grand gates, you’re transported into the royal world of the Wadiyar dynasty. The architecture is absolutely stunning – a perfect blend of Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic styles that will leave you speechless.\n\nInside, every hall is more magnificent than the last, with stained glass ceilings, intricately carved doors, and royal artifacts that tell the story of Mysore’s glorious past. The Kalyana Mantapa (wedding hall) is a true highlight with its colorful peacock-themed ceiling and chandeliers.\n\nBut the real magic begins in the evening – when the entire palace is illuminated with thousands of lights, it looks like a golden dream come alive! If you get the chance, don’t miss the light and sound show – it beautifully narrates the history of the palace.\n\nWhether you’re a history lover, architecture enthusiast, or a casual traveler, this place is a must-visit. It’s clean, well-maintained, and rich in culture.\n\n✅ Stunning interiors\n✅ Great for photography\n✅ Rich historical experience\n✅ Evening lighting is a visual treat\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nOne of the best royal palaces in India. A visit you’ll always remember!"

The palace is absolutely stunning, with a massive structure and intricate architecture that truly make it a highlight of Mysore.\nBe prepared for some walking as you explore the beautifully maintained grounds. It's well worth it to take in the details of the palace from every angle. It's also a fantastic place for photography—the majestic exteriors and richly decorated interiors provide countless opportunities for amazing photos, whether you're taking portraits or just capturing candid moments.\nWithin the palace complex, you'll also find a few temples, which add a peaceful and cultural touch to the visit. Overall, it's a memorable place that I highly recommend."

The ticket cost is around 120 Rupees which I didn't think it was worth it as there was no crowd management. But overall good visit and good experience.\n\nPalace is very beautiful ❤️"

The palace is absolutely stunning, with a massive structure and intricate architecture that truly make it a highlight of Mysore.\nBe prepared for some walking as you explore the beautifully maintained grounds. It's well worth it to take in the details of the palace from every angle. It's also a fantastic place for photography—the majestic exteriors and richly decorated interiors provide countless opportunities for amazing photos, whether you're taking portraits or just capturing candid moments.\nWithin the palace complex, you'll also find a few temples, which add a peaceful and cultural touch to the visit. Overall, it's a memorable place that I highly recommend."

Located in the heart of Mysore city, the palace has been holding its charm ever since it was constructed decades ago. Each section of the palace speaks out its legacy of the royal family and their importance in the Mysore dynasty and the Bangalore history. A lot of the palace area is restricted for visitors but the area accessible by the visitors make you drop your jaw while you endure its legacy. It’s beautiful, architecture is outstanding and the beautifully restored walls. I’d highly recommend anyone visiting Bangalore of Mysore to visit this place, you’d not regret your time. The entry ticket is ₹120 per person and there’s ample parking space outside. There’s also toilets after the entry and some food outlets as well. A lot of street vendors outside the palace are selling souvenirs, snacks and everything that you might need for a quick bite."

The light show happens daily from 7 to 8pm and it is free to enter and see no ticket. You may have to pay for parking though. There are many shops all around to buy eatables and toys and other things like crafts, collectables, etc. It is nice good for taking a walk near a scenic and beautiful place."

              "reviewText": "St. Philomena’s Church in Mysore stands as one of the most remarkable examples of Neo-Gothic architecture in India. Built in 1936, its soaring twin spires, visible from afar, make it an iconic landmark of the city. The church interior is equally captivating, with impressive stained-glass panels depicting scenes from the life of Christ, creating a serene and contemplative atmosphere.\n\nThe church premises are well maintained, offering visitors both a spiritual retreat and a glimpse into Mysore’s rich heritage. It is not only a place of worship but also a cultural attraction that draws people from around the world. For anyone exploring Mysore, St. Philomena’s Church is an essential stop that beautifully blends history, architecture, and devotion."

What I found especially fascinating is that the church looks much larger from the outside than it feels on the inside – the interior seems almost small and humble in comparison, yet this adds to its charm and intimacy. The church is spotless, well maintained, and offers a peaceful space for rest, reflection, and prayer. A visit to Mysore would not be complete without experiencing this beautiful and imposing landmark."

It was constructed in 1936 with a Neo Gothic style, honour to the memory of Saint Philomena. It's architecture was inspired by the beautiful Cologne Cathedral in Germany. It is one of the tallest church in Asia. The twins spires raising 175 feet are inspiring and the stained glass windows, lofty towers and a marble altar. The outside of the church looks grand, and inside feel spiritual. The serene interior offers a peaceful atmosphere for reflections. It welcomes visitors of all religion and the most important thing is you need to maintain silence. The church is open from 5 am to 6 pm and you can attend mass at the church, which held in Kannada, Tamil and English. It's a very divine place just stand inside the prayer hall, and feel the waves of peace flowing in to your soul.\n\nThe parking is quite difficult."

              "reviewText": "When Scholars felt the need to collect, and preserve Sanskrit and Kannada palm leaf and Manuscripts, the idea of establishing an institution in the name of ‘Oriental Library’ came in their mind and that resulted in its establishment by Maharaja Sri Chamaraja Wadeyar in 1891. Mysore University was started in 1916. Since then ‘Oriental Library’ became an integral part of Mysore University. Its objects are to collect, preserve, edit and publish the rare valuable Sanskrit and Kannada palm leaf as well as Paper Manuscripts available in our country. Later in 1943 ‘Oriental Library’ was renamed as ‘Oriental Research Institute’.\nIt is managed and administered by Director and staff. It has compiled and published ‘Sritattvanidhi’ of Sri Mummadi Krishnaraja Wadeyar, in three Volumes, comprising of Shakthi Nidhi, Vishnu Nidhi and Shiva Nidhi, apart from many other rare Sanskrit works. It has to its credit vast number of collection exceeding a lakh. Its library, as I have seen, contains more than 50,000 books in Sanskrit, Kannada, English, Hindi and other languages. It is an internationally recognised institution getting financial aid from USA and others.\nInfact Oriental Library was the first public library in Mysore that was dedicated to the cause of research and editing of manuscripts, keeping Indology as its prime focus. It has published nearly 200 titles from 1893 till date. It has preserved in its womb a rich collection of more than 75000 ancient, rare and highly valued materials, books and documents. I can quote some important and rare collections like Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics by James Hastings, Vedic Concordance by Maurice Bloomfield and critical editions of Ramayana and Mahabharata. I could not find any difficulty to pick the book of choice because the books are systematically arranged to have easy access to reader’s desired books and documents.\nThe palm leaves manuscripts are of standard size of 15cm x 3.5cm. These are extraordinary manuscripts that open an unusual window to literature, philosophy, astrology, religious practices and languages that were in vogue in primordial times. Manuscripts are organic materials at risk of decay and destruction by Silverfish. Lemon grass oil is applied on manuscripts to preserve them. Lemon grass oil actually injects natural fluidity into the brittle palm leaves and hydrophobic nature of oil keeps the manuscripts dry and the text is not lost due to humidity. Conventional method is adopted to preserve manuscripts in microfilm. Original manuscripts are available for reference. ‘The Emperor's Riddles’ authored by Satyarth Nayak was featured by it in 2014. It is a mystery thriller novel as I have seen. I have visited this library several times.\nOriental Institute is a treasure trove for knowledge seekers and research students and scholars, having preserved several greatest works of literature, philosophy, religion and what not! Visitors are allowed to see the palm leaf and paper manuscripts. It has preserved not only the rare manuscripts safely but also makes them available for research purposes. The name itself suggests its commitments to propagate Indian culture and heritage. It has been encouraging and furthering Indological research all these years from its inception. It is in reality a museum displaying 50,000 ancient palm-leaf manuscripts and later manuscripts in paper.\nOriental Institute is found at northern end of Krishnaraja Boulevard Road. It is adjacently opposite to Crawford Hall and within the campus of Mysore University. Its building is architecturally beautiful and attracts viewers from a distance. It is actually the Jubilee Hall built in 1887 to commemorate golden jubilee of Queen Victoria`s taking over British throne.\nIt is kept open for public from 8am to 8pm on all days. Contact on 0821 – 2420331/2419336."

If you get the chance, don’t miss the light and sound show – it beautifully narrates the history of the palace.\n\nWhether you’re a history lover, architecture enthusiast, or a casual traveler, this place is a must-visit.

It's not your typical sterile shopping experience; it's raw, it's bustling, and it's full of life.\nThe first thing that hits you is the explosion of colors and smells. Piles upon piles of bright fruits and vegetables are everywhere – the deep red of tomatoes, the vibrant yellow of bananas, the lush green of leafy vegetables. And the fragrance? A mix of sweet flowers, earthy spices, and fresh produce all mingling together. It’s quite intoxicating!\nWhat I loved is how authentic it feels. You see local vendors, many of whom have been there for generations, passionately selling their goods. There's a real buzz of interaction between them and the customers, a friendly banter that you don't often find in modern supermarkets.\nYou can find pretty much anything here, from fresh produce and flowers (oh, the marigolds and jasmine are just gorgeous!) to spices, incense, and even some household items. It’s a feast for the senses at every turn.\nNavigating through the narrow pathways can be a bit chaotic, with people and handcarts moving around, but that's part of its charm. It feels like you're right in the heart of the city's everyday life.\nI spent a good amount of time just wandering around, taking it all in. I bought some fragrant spices and a few local fruits that I hadn't tried before. It felt good to support the local economy directly.\nIt's not a fancy, air-conditioned mall; it's a traditional market, and it has all the character that comes with that. If you want to experience the real pulse of Mysore and soak in the local culture, Devaraja Market is a must-visit. Just be prepared for the crowds and the sensory overload – embrace it, and you'll have a fantastic time!\nIn a human way:\n* It's a vibrant and bustling market with an explosion of colors and smells.\n* You can find a wide variety of fresh produce, flowers, and spices.\n* It feels very authentic, with local vendors and lively interactions.\n* It's a great place to experience the local culture and support the community.\n* Be prepared for crowds and a sensory-rich environment.\nIf you're looking for an authentic and lively experience in Mysore, Devaraja Market is definitely worth exploring. It's a sensory adventure!"

The roads are wide and smooth, making the drive or ride genuinely enjoyable.\n\nHeads up on footwear storage:\n\nSome shops near the parking will try to tell you there’s no shoe storage at the top — don’t believe them. It’s just a way to get you to buy pooja items so they can “watch” your footwear.\n\nTruth is, there’s proper footwear storage available right near the temple entrance, with a ₹5 token system — safe, easy, and no pressure to buy anything.\n\nEntry options:\n\n1. ₹100 – Front gate (quickest)\n\n2. ₹30 – Side entry (bit of a line but manageable)\n\nThey do not accept online payments, so carry cash.\n\nAlso, you’ll find washrooms and a few refreshment stalls nearby in case you need a quick bite or drink post-darshan."

Perched atop Chamundi Hills, the temple offers breathtaking views of the city below. The intricate architecture and vibrant decorations make it a must-visit for devotees and tourists alike. The majestic Nandi statue at the foothills is equally impressive, symbolizing devotion and strength. The temple's history and mythology are palpable, and the serene atmosphere provides a perfect setting for reflection. A truly enriching experience that showcases the rich cultural heritage of Karnataka.\""

Although it was a rip off when it came to the food.\n\nOver priced dishes and there was nothing unique. It was the regular dishes that were served like Dosas, idles and chaat items.\nLoved the experience but not the food."

There are serious concerns regarding racism, favoritism, and unethical behavior from some of the faculty members. Classes are irregular, exams are not conducted on time, and there seems to be a complete lack of structure or proper management.\n\nIt is incredibly disheartening to have come such a long way for quality education, only to be met with this level of mismanagement.

              "reviewText": "At a distance of 2 km from Mysore Railway Station, Freedom Fighter's Park is a public park located in the Chamrajapura locality of Mysore, Karnataka. Also known as Subbarayanakere Park, it is one of the places to visit in Mysore.\n\nFreedom Fighter's Park was built to commemorate the 'Mysore Chalo' movement, one of the most significant events in the history of Mysuru which resulted in the establishment of a democratic government in Mysore. Freedom fighters assembled at this very spot, launching a resistance movement when the Maharaja of Mysore retained the rule of the state. As a part of the protest, the Indian flag was hoisted every day at this park by freedom fighters, which eventually made the Maharaja surrender to the demand for democracy in 1947.\n\nIt is a huge park known for its unmatched beauty, lush green lawns, and bright flower beds. The major attractions of the park are the captivating and magnificent statues of the freedom fighters including Mahatma Gandhi. The park also has a separate play area for kids and space for yoga, meditation, etc. Revisit the scenes of India's struggle to become a democracy amidst nature's beauty at this park as part of Mysore tour packages."

I was quite happy looking at their portfolio and I approached them. I had a closed budget and everything I had clearly explained over the phone to principal architect Mr.Wari. He was humble and polite. He asked me to visit office and on the same day I visited the office on the agreed time. He explained me everything, took my details and finally said, he would send out the details on email about the rates and procedures. Though I followed up aggressively, I have not got any sort of response from him.\n\nMy final conclusion is that, instead of wasting my time along with his time, if he is not able to take project due to whatever reason, he should have been upfront and honest. Being in the industry for so long, they are lagging of the professionalism.\n\nSo anyone out there, before approaching this architect, be prepared that, they may go absconding or they may not entertain you for various reasons which even they don't tell you. Totally unprofessional."

The roads are wide and smooth, making the drive or ride genuinely enjoyable.\n\nHeads up on footwear storage:\n\nSome shops near the parking will try to tell you there’s no shoe storage at the top — don’t believe them. It’s just a way to get you to buy pooja items so they can “watch” your footwear.\n\nTruth is, there’s proper footwear storage available right near the temple entrance, with a ₹5 token system — safe, easy, and no pressure to buy anything.\n\nEntry options:\n\n1. ₹100 – Front gate (quickest)\n\n2. ₹30 – Side entry (bit of a line but manageable)\n\nThey do not accept online payments, so carry cash.\n\nAlso, you’ll find washrooms and a few refreshment stalls nearby in case you need a quick bite or drink post-darshan."

The route leading up was nothing short of majestic, wrapped in mist and fog, giving it an almost surreal charm. There was a calm in the air, a sense of peace that stays with you. Truly a heavenly experience, both spiritually and visually."

The temple’s architecture is beautiful, and the divine energy inside is truly captivating. While the climb up the 1,000 steps is challenging, it’s worth it for the serene atmosphere and the feeling of accomplishment. Early mornings are ideal to avoid crowds and enjoy the peaceful surroundings. A must-visit for anyone seeking spirituality and cultural heritage!"

I was advised by Dr M B Padma, then  principal not to take English Literature as major, instead would study Kannada major so that I could achieve great. The reason she had pointed out that I had studied in Kannada medium. She also said that you are eligible to get English according to the ranking list (17th Rank). Then I didn't know much about the career and courses difficulty. Now I feel that I would have studied Kannada Literature and would have achieved better career success. Currently, Iam lecturer in Teacher Training Institute in Bengaluru.\n\nFortunate to have had such a greater care and concern she took. We were blessed to have eminent professors, HoDs and Principal. To name a few Prof C Naganna, P N Sridevi, Latha K Biddappa, Anitha V Braggs, Bhagavan, R Keshav, B Ramachandrappa, Cha Sarvamangala and so on. The kind of alround development we could experience was so great. I was also did NCC.\n\nI had a rural background and my parents were poor. I had to work part-time from 3:30pm to 12 midnight every day for my books and fees, meals."
