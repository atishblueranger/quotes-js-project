              "reviewText": "Christ Church is not just a landmark of Shimla — it's a living piece of history. Standing tall on The Ridge with its signature yellow walls and neo-Gothic architecture, this beautiful church offers a serene escape from the busy tourist crowd.\n\nAs soon as you step in, there's a feeling of peace and stillness. The stained-glass windows casting colorful reflections, the old wooden pews, and the soft echo of silence make you want to sit, reflect, or simply admire the beauty around. The church was built in 1857, making it the second oldest church in North India — and every inch of it whispers tales from the colonial era.\n\nWhether it's mist rolling in during monsoon, snow falling silently in winter, or the golden sunset during summer — Christ Church looks absolutely magical in every season.\n\nBest Parts:\n\nBeautiful architecture and photogenic exterior, especially at night when it lights up ✨\n\nPeaceful interiors, perfect for a moment of reflection\n\nRight in the heart of The Ridge — easy to reach and surrounded by cafes & local markets\n\nOften hosts small prayer services and carol singing around Christmas"

Built in 1857, it’s the second oldest church in North India, and its Neo-Gothic architecture, stained glass windows, and tall spire transport you to another era.\n\nThe church is especially stunning at sunrise or after sunset, when it’s beautifully lit and surrounded by the buzz of the Mall Road yet holds a quiet, spiritual aura. Whether you’re inside listening to the calm silence or outside admiring its beauty against the Himalayan backdrop, you’ll feel a deep sense of peace.\n\nPerfect for photographers, history lovers, and spiritual seekers alike."

We had a great time exploring its stunning architecture and learning about its rich colonial history. The calm and silence inside the church added to the experience, and it was also a chance to appreciate and understand a different religion. Do note that the church has specific visiting hours, so it’s better to check the timings before you go. A must-visit spot if you’re in Shimla."

              "reviewText": "The Christ Church of Shimla, in Himachal Pradesh, India, is located on one end of the Mall, on the way from\nRidge To US Club .\nThis tall, Yellow coloured structure on the Ridge, in Shimla, has become a landmark for anyone exploring Shimla in Himachal Pradesh. This iconic structure is not just a church but has become an identity for Shimla due to its historic existence, architecture and prime location.\nThe moment we reach the Ridge, the Neo-Gothic architecture of Christ Church immediately draws our eyes . Its yellow facade with a clock tower, against the background of the Himalayan peaks, simply looks amazing. This church is a living legacy of the British Times.\nIt is said that the Christ Church, of Shimla is the second oldest church in North India after the St. John’s Church in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.\nWorship here is conducted both in Hindi and English. The Church is affiliated to the Church of North India.\nShimla was mostly forest when the Europeans first came to the hills in 1820s. They sought permission from the Raja of Keonthal, under whose state much of Simla area fell, to build their residences and then built this church in the year 1857.\nThe Christ Church was designed by Colonel J. T Boileau in 1844, and the cornerstone was laid on 9 September 1844 by Bishop Daniel Wilson, who was the Bishop of Calcutta. The church was consecrated on 10 January 1857 by Bishop Thomas Daltrey,  who was the Bishop of Madras. The estimated cost of construction at that time was around Rs. 50,000/-. The clock on the Christ Church was donated by Colonel  Dumbleton in 1860. A British made pipe-organ was installed in 1899.\nThe first Indian Chaplain of Christ Church Shimla was Rev. B.S. Chander (1948 to 1957).\nChrist Church continues to be well maintained and is in relatively good condition. The clock's original mechanical mechanism has been replaced with an electrical one .\nThe church is lit at night to illuminate it. The church has five stained glass windows and it houses the largest pipe organ in the Indian subcontinent.\nEven now the Church continues to serve as a place of worship for the Christians in Shimla and remains a cherished landmark and tourist attraction. There is no entry fees.\nThe height of the Christ Church is around 90 feet. There are several paintings inside the Church, which portray the life story of Jesus Christ.\nThe Christ Church is open from 10:30 AM to 1:00 PM and from 2:15 PM to 5:30 PM every day."

The station offers a range of bus services to various destinations, but the facilities are fairly basic with clean restrooms and some food vendors. However, the station can be crowded and the buses may not always be punctual or comfortable. If you have the option, you may want to consider other transportation options. Nevertheless, the old bus stand can be a convenient and economical choice for those on a tight budget and looking to get around Shimla and the surrounding areas."

              "reviewText": "I recently visited Bantony Castle, and it was one of the most memorable parts of my Shimla trip. This heritage site is located near Mall Road, just a short walk from Scandal Point, yet it feels peaceful and away from the busy crowds.\n\n🏰 History & Architecture\n\nBantony Castle was built in the 1880s in classic Tudor (chalet-style) architecture — with wooden frames, sloped roofs, and old-world charm. It was originally the summer palace of the Maharaja of Sirmaur and later used by the British, then by the Himachal Police Department. Over time, it fell into disrepair, but thankfully the Himachal Pradesh government bought and restored it, opening it to the public in 2023 as a heritage and cultural center.\n\nThe restoration has kept the building’s colonial-era character intact while adding modern touches like a digital museum and beautiful landscaped lawns.\n\n🖼️ Museum Experience\n\nInside the castle is a modern digital museum that walks you through the history of Shimla — from its early days, through the British Raj, the freedom movement, and into present times. The exhibits are very well done, with touchscreen displays, 3D models, and audio guides. I particularly liked the sections on:\n•\tMahatma Gandhi’s visits to Shimla\n•\tDr. Y.S. Parmar and Himachal’s statehood journey\n•\tThe story of Satyanand Stokes and apple farming\n•\tPhotos and maps of old Shimla\n\nIt’s not a huge museum, but it’s compact, clean, and thoughtfully curated.\n\n🎆 Light & Sound Show\n\nThe light and sound show in the evening is a must-watch! It’s projected right on the castle building and beautifully narrates Shimla’s journey through time, with visuals, music, and narration by Anupam Kher (in both English and Hindi). It’s around 30 minutes long and gives you goosebumps with its storytelling. The sound and visuals are crisp, and the open-air setting adds to the charm.\n\n🌿 Surroundings & Facilities\n•\tThe castle is surrounded by well-maintained gardens and open spaces, perfect for a quiet walk or photos.\n•\tThere’s seating outside, a small amphitheatre, and a food kiosk being planned soon.\n•\tClean washrooms and drinking water available on-site.\n•\tSecurity and staff were polite and helpful.\n\n💵 Visitor Information\n•\tEntry fee: ₹50 for the museum, ₹100 for the light & sound show (totally worth it)\n•\tTimings: 10 AM to 5 PM (museum); show starts in the evening (summer: after 8 PM)\n•\tClosed on Mondays\n•\tEasily accessible by car or a short walk from Mall Road/Kali Bari temple area\n\n⸻\n\n✅ What I loved:\n•\tHistorical architecture combined with modern presentation\n•\tCalm, open environment with no crowds\n•\tInsightful and engaging exhibits\n•\tGreat for families, students, and history lovers\n•\tVery affordable and well-managed\n\n⸻\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nBantony Castle is a shining example of heritage preservation done right. It’s educational, peaceful, and visually stunning. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Shimla — especially if you want to go beyond the usual tourist spots and connect with the city’s past in a deeper way."

Be careful of the monkeys although they didn't bug us much, but we saw two incidents where they went after food and sorta scared the people. Please don't litter around here. As, the monkeys tend to pick it up and spread it more.

The temple is located at the height of 8050 ft. There are 3 ways of reaching the temple, first on foot(quite a height to climb) second by taking a taxi (easiest) and third is by ropeway (costlier and quicker). The view from the hilltop is simply mesmerizing. Go there when in Shimla."

The views from the station are breathtaking, especially in the early morning or during winter when the hills are blanketed in snow. It's quiet, clean, and well-maintained — a rarity for hill stations with heavy tourist footfall.\n\nThe staff is polite and helpful, always ready to assist with a smile. The quaint waiting area, small tea stalls serving hot chai, and the slow, rhythmic arrival of toy trains all contribute to the magical atmosphere. Whether you're arriving for a vacation or bidding goodbye to the hills, this station offers a perfect start or end to your journey.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone visiting Shimla — not just for the travel convenience, but for the experience itself."

As a Level 9 Google Local Guide, I found this place to be one of the most well-preserved and informative heritage sites in India.\n\n🕰️ History & Heritage:\nBuilt in 1888, this magnificent British-era structure served as the residence of the Viceroy of India. Walking through its grand halls, you can almost feel the echoes of major pre-independence political decisions. It's also where the Shimla Conference of 1945 took place.\n\n🏰 Architecture & Grounds:\nThe Scottish Baronial-style architecture is jaw-dropping. From beautifully carved wooden interiors to its lush green lawns and panoramic views of the surrounding hills — every corner is a postcard. Perfect for history buffs, architecture lovers, and photographers alike.\n\n🎟️ Entry & Guide Services:\nThe guided tour inside the building is well-organized (limited to certain rooms for preservation reasons). The guides are knowledgeable and narrate history in an engaging manner. The entry ticket is reasonably priced, and students often get a discount.\n\n📸 Photo Tip:\nPhotography is allowed only outside the building, but the gardens and exteriors are more than enough to fill your camera roll!\n\n🧼 Cleanliness & Facilities:\nVery well-maintained premises. Clean restrooms, drinking water stations, and well-marked walking paths.\n\n🅿️ Parking & Access:\nAmple parking is available near the entrance. Though a bit uphill, it’s accessible by car or taxi. Wheelchair access is limited but the staff is helpful.\n\n☕ Nearby Amenities:\nThere’s a small café and bookstore inside the campus. Also close to other Shimla attractions like the State Museum and Annandale.\n\n🔁 Best Time to Visit:\nEarly mornings or late afternoons. Autumn and Spring bring out the best colors in the garden landscape.\n\n---\n\nFinal Verdict:\nWhether you're a traveler, student, or just someone seeking a peaceful retreat with a story — Viceregal Lodge is an experience, not just a destination. Highly recommended for a half-day visit in Shimla!"

              "reviewText": "An Architectural Wonder Frozen in Time\n\nIt’s hard to fathom that this remarkable structure dates back to the 1880s — a testament to both imagination and engineering far ahead of its time. At first glance, the exterior might strike you as another fort or palace, but that impression fades the moment you step inside. The interiors tell a different story altogether: walls dressed in rich teak, soaring ceilings, and regal chandeliers that echo an era of elegance and ambition.\n\nThe building carries layers of history within its silent halls — stories begging to be told. Yet, only a fraction is accessible to the public. Just three rooms are open — barely 5% of the entire property. The rest remains locked away, not for mystery, but due to neglect. It’s disheartening, a stark reminder of how easily heritage slips through our fingers when not properly cherished.\n\nUnfortunately, the guided tour did little to enhance the experience. The narrative was flat and robotic, devoid of depth or passion. When I tried to dig deeper, the guide chose indifference over engagement.\n\nThere’s so much more this place could offer — if only given the attention and reverence it deserves. With proper care and storytelling, it could transform from a forgotten monument to a vibrant window into history."

This iconic structure is not just a church but has become an identity for Shimla due to its historic existence, architecture and prime location.\nThe moment we reach the Ridge, the Neo-Gothic architecture of Christ Church immediately draws our eyes . Its yellow facade with a clock tower, against the background of the Himalayan peaks, simply looks amazing. This church is a living legacy of the British Times.\nIt is said that the Christ Church, of Shimla is the second oldest church in North India after the St. John’s Church in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.\nWorship here is conducted both in Hindi and English. The Church is affiliated to the Church of North India.\nShimla was mostly forest when the Europeans first came to the hills in 1820s. They sought permission from the Raja of Keonthal, under whose state much of Simla area fell, to build their residences and then built this church in the year 1857.\nThe Christ Church was designed by Colonel J. T Boileau in 1844, and the cornerstone was laid on 9 September 1844 by Bishop Daniel Wilson, who was the Bishop of Calcutta. The church was consecrated on 10 January 1857 by Bishop Thomas Daltrey,  who was the Bishop of Madras. The estimated cost of construction at that time was around Rs. 50,000/-. The clock on the Christ Church was donated by Colonel  Dumbleton in 1860. A British made pipe-organ was installed in 1899.\nThe first Indian Chaplain of Christ Church Shimla was Rev. B.S. Chander (1948 to 1957).\nChrist Church continues to be well maintained and is in relatively good condition. The clock's original mechanical mechanism has been replaced with an electrical one .\nThe church is lit at night to illuminate it. The church has five stained glass windows and it houses the largest pipe organ in the Indian subcontinent.\nEven now the Church continues to serve as a place of worship for the Christians in Shimla and remains a cherished landmark and tourist attraction. There is no entry fees.\nThe height of the Christ Church is around 90 feet. There are several paintings inside the Church, which portray the life story of Jesus Christ.\nThe Christ Church is open from 10:30 AM to 1:00 PM and from 2:15 PM to 5:30 PM every day."

Its classic Tudor-style architecture, grand stone steps, and detailed wooden frames make it one of the most photogenic landmarks in the city.\n\nI was genuinely impressed by how well it has been maintained and restored. The structure feels like it’s straight out of a historical film set. Especially during the evenings, when the lights glow against the stone walls — it looks absolutely magical.\n\nIt’s still a functioning municipal office, but tourists are welcome to admire and click pictures from the outside. Located right next to Christ Church and The Ridge, it’s the perfect stop during a leisurely stroll through Shimla’s heart.\n\nTip: Visit in the early evening to catch the golden hour light and enjoy the local cafés nearby for a warm drink after."

The museum is stunning, highly photogenic, and has an international feel. It is impeccably clean, surrounded by lush greenery, and undoubtedly one of the most beautiful museums I have visited in India. Located about 4 km from Kachi Ghati, Shimla, the entry fee is ₹50 per person. However, if you wish to take pictures, an additional ₹100 charge applies for mobile cameras—without it, photography is not allowed. I highly recommend getting the camera ticket, as the museum houses an extensive collection spanning centuries, filling you with awe and joy. The staff is exceptionally polite and helpful. To explore the entire collection properly, you’ll need at least two hours. This is a great place to visit with family, especially for those with kids. The museum also offers wheelchair- ♿ accessible parking 🅿️ and entrance, ensuring convenience for all visitors."

According to a plaque outside, this was constructed in 1896-7, the work being carried out by a Bombay-based construction company. The building replaced some earlier houses, which were demolished to make way for this building which was meant to house various government public works departments as well as the railway board.\n\nThe building has been renovated and restored in the recent past, following a fire that destroyed part of it. Even today it houses several government departments and is therefore out of bounds for the general public. It’s a beautiful edifice even on the outside, though, so you don’t really need to enter it to admire it."

To ensure safety and fire resistant structure, the building was one of the important buildings of the British Empire. The building built in 1896, held offices of the PWD’s Secretary, Railway Board and a Department of Commerce in the form of Accountant-General.The building was initially designated as the 'Public Works Department Secretariat Offices'. At present, many of the central Government offices reside inside the building. The building received its current name, when it housed Railway Board in 1923. The fire resistant structure was found intact without any major loss during a blaze in the top floor in 2001.The historic building was constructed by a Bombay based enterprise, Richardson and Cruddas that has four levels above the road level and three below. The 3 below levels are exposed from the other side of the building."

The construction cost that was done on Railway Board Building at that time was about Rs. 4,08, 476 which was a very big sum 105 years back. Earlier this site served as the residences known as ‘Herbert House and Low Ville’. Then it was rented by the government to run Public Works Department and then the Railway Board and Commerce Department. Finally all these were demolished and this beautiful Railway Board Building was constructed here.\n\nThe building has four storeys from the road, provided with very beautiful, artistic iron stairs. Climbing up the floors through these stairs gives a royal touch of ‘Raj Mahal’. In British era the buildings were constructed keeping security feature in priority. Railway Board Building is thus a cast iron and steel structure, in order to make the building fire resistant."

              "reviewText": "Shimla Kali Bari is truly a divine and peaceful place that offers much more than just a temple visit. Located very close to Mall Road, it’s easily accessible on foot and serves as a perfect escape from the tourist rush while still being centrally located. This temple, dedicated to Goddess Kali, is not only a place of worship but also a spiritual sanctuary filled with calm, devotion, and tradition.\n\nThe temple holds immense significance, especially for Bengali devotees, as it was originally established in the early 19th century by Bengali followers of Maa Kali. The architecture reflects classic Bengali temple design—simple yet graceful. The idol of Maa Kali is beautifully adorned and worshipped with great devotion. The spiritual energy inside the temple is strong, yet incredibly soothing.\n\nWhat adds to the uniqueness of this place is that Shimla Kali Bari also offers accommodation facilities. There is a Dharamshala/guest house within the temple premises, which is affordable, clean, and safe. It is especially convenient for solo travelers, families, or elderly visitors who are looking for budget-friendly and centrally located lodging. The rooms are basic but well-maintained, and the surroundings are quiet, making it ideal for a peaceful stay.\n\nIn addition to lodging, simple vegetarian food (Bengali-style bhog or meals) is often served to the guests and devotees, especially during festivals or on special puja days. The food is homemade, clean, and served with devotion. However, for regular meals, there are plenty of restaurants and eateries nearby on Mall Road and The Ridge, just a short walk away. So both traditional temple prasad and outside dining options are easily accessible.\n\nDuring festivals like Durga Puja, Kali Puja, and Diwali, the temple becomes even more vibrant and colorful with beautiful decorations, lighting, bhajans, and cultural programs. The community vibe during these times is truly heartwarming, and it’s an amazing way to witness the cultural richness of Bengali traditions in the hills of Himachal.\n\nOverall, Shimla Kali Bari is much more than a temple – it offers a full spiritual and cultural experience, complete with stay, food, and soul-soothing surroundings. Whether you’re a devotee, a traveler, or someone simply looking to connect with inner peace, this is a must-visit destination in Shimla."

              "reviewText": "Having spent 8 years in the school, I believe this review of my time at BCS will be bitter sweet. The institution is greedy for your money (comparing the amount of services and standard of education provided). Education after school is also not at par in comparison with graduating students from competition schools such as Doon, Mayo or Scindia.\n\nThe school has institutionalised bullying and corporal punishment. Often finding pride in the same as it supposedly makes one a ‘man’. The school is still very much colonised, much a shame in the 21st century. Unabashed misplacement of accountability is visible in the school’s replies to reviews calling out the school for violence on campus. Discounting someone’s trauma on the internet should not be an institutions first course of action.\n\nThe amount of gaslighting that we were put through to stop complaints ever reaching the faculty was out of the ordinary. We were occasionally beaten up by faculty members (not all, BCS also had some of the best teachers and wardens, thank you for the same) and seniors sometimes even to a pulp with no outage to complain as it was ‘looked down upon’ and would inherently mean even worse treatment by your seniors and batch-mates.\n\nOpportunities were not as accessible as they should be in a top ranked school, some change is visible in this sector after the change of senior faculty in 2020. Communication skills and awareness are integral skills for a modern life that are often overlooked while it should be a priority as people ‘able’ to teach the ward these skills are far away, hence it is your responsibility to help the ward gain these important skills.\n\nAll in all, would recommend that you attest caution before admitting your ward, as these will be life-changing years and you do not want the kid to live in survival mode rather grow with progressive competition. Mental health and confidence building is not a priority at the institution and they do not have a full-time mental health counsellor, so in case your child is neurodivergent or has ADHD, they could be in for a hard-time.\n\nNot recommended, if complete and better than the best education is what you are looking for but an experience nonetheless."

It was founded by Bishop George Edward Lynch Cotton in the year 1859. The school has seen many Principals. And the current principal is Mr. Roy Christopher Robinson. It is a purely boarding school and not for boarders. It also has its own infirmary to take care of the illnesses of the students. All types of sports are played in the school and also inter school matches are there at school levels. And at internal level, house matches are there as the students are divided into separate houses which are Curzon, Ibbetson, Lefroy, Rivaz. Education system is also very good. The school focuses on all round development of the student with physical and mental education. The campus of the school is very big and this can be understood by the fact that there are two big grounds for games like football, cricket, etc and it also has basketball courts, for tennis also. There is also a swimming pool. And there are all types of games played in the school. There is Sports Day celebrated in the school every year and all the major festivals are also celebrated in the school every year. The school campus is also used in the shooting of many films like Gadar, Sanam Re, Udaan, etc. It is an example for other schools not only in India but the entire world."

              "reviewText": "I recently visited Bantony Castle, and it was one of the most memorable parts of my Shimla trip. This heritage site is located near Mall Road, just a short walk from Scandal Point, yet it feels peaceful and away from the busy crowds.\n\n🏰 History & Architecture\n\nBantony Castle was built in the 1880s in classic Tudor (chalet-style) architecture — with wooden frames, sloped roofs, and old-world charm. It was originally the summer palace of the Maharaja of Sirmaur and later used by the British, then by the Himachal Police Department. Over time, it fell into disrepair, but thankfully the Himachal Pradesh government bought and restored it, opening it to the public in 2023 as a heritage and cultural center.\n\nThe restoration has kept the building’s colonial-era character intact while adding modern touches like a digital museum and beautiful landscaped lawns.\n\n🖼️ Museum Experience\n\nInside the castle is a modern digital museum that walks you through the history of Shimla — from its early days, through the British Raj, the freedom movement, and into present times. The exhibits are very well done, with touchscreen displays, 3D models, and audio guides. I particularly liked the sections on:\n•\tMahatma Gandhi’s visits to Shimla\n•\tDr. Y.S. Parmar and Himachal’s statehood journey\n•\tThe story of Satyanand Stokes and apple farming\n•\tPhotos and maps of old Shimla\n\nIt’s not a huge museum, but it’s compact, clean, and thoughtfully curated.\n\n🎆 Light & Sound Show\n\nThe light and sound show in the evening is a must-watch! It’s projected right on the castle building and beautifully narrates Shimla’s journey through time, with visuals, music, and narration by Anupam Kher (in both English and Hindi). It’s around 30 minutes long and gives you goosebumps with its storytelling. The sound and visuals are crisp, and the open-air setting adds to the charm.\n\n🌿 Surroundings & Facilities\n•\tThe castle is surrounded by well-maintained gardens and open spaces, perfect for a quiet walk or photos.\n•\tThere’s seating outside, a small amphitheatre, and a food kiosk being planned soon.\n•\tClean washrooms and drinking water available on-site.\n•\tSecurity and staff were polite and helpful.\n\n💵 Visitor Information\n•\tEntry fee: ₹50 for the museum, ₹100 for the light & sound show (totally worth it)\n•\tTimings: 10 AM to 5 PM (museum); show starts in the evening (summer: after 8 PM)\n•\tClosed on Mondays\n•\tEasily accessible by car or a short walk from Mall Road/Kali Bari temple area\n\n⸻\n\n✅ What I loved:\n•\tHistorical architecture combined with modern presentation\n•\tCalm, open environment with no crowds\n•\tInsightful and engaging exhibits\n•\tGreat for families, students, and history lovers\n•\tVery affordable and well-managed\n\n⸻\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nBantony Castle is a shining example of heritage preservation done right. It’s educational, peaceful, and visually stunning. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Shimla — especially if you want to go beyond the usual tourist spots and connect with the city’s past in a deeper way."

When I visited, it wasn’t too busy, which made the experience even more peaceful and enjoyable.\n\nIt’s a great place for a quiet walk, surrounded by history and a bit of greenery. The digital museum adds a modern touch to the visit, but even just strolling around the grounds feels refreshing. If you’re in Shimla and want a calm, scenic break away from the crowded spots, Bantony Castle is definitely worth a visit."

This beautiful building was constructed after dismantling an old building of the same name that housed the Military Department of the Punjab Government till 1886.\nher Abbot sought permission for construction from the then Secretary of the Municipal Committee Major W.P. Larson and wrote \" you are aware of the intensions of the Punjab Government to pull down the house 'Ellerslie' and build on the site a new set of offices to accommodate the whole of Punjab Secretariat.\" The permission was granted on 28th June, 1899. The inside of Ellerslie is made of stone quarried from Sanjauli and Barnes Court (Present Raj Bhawan) and stuck together using lime mortar. The brickwork too has lime mortar cementing. The Himachal Pradesh Secretariat occupied it in the summers of 1967. In July 1972 the \"Summit Hall\" where the cabinet meetings are held was spruced up and was given this name as initial summit meeting for Shimla Agreement between India and Pakistan. This building with sub-basement, basement and three floors, now has 143 rooms and 31 toilets. It covers and area of about 8663 meters."

And 1 hour is enough.\nYour legs would get sore in just one hour, as you have to put so much pressure on them from both sides so that you can balance yourself.\nOnce you are able to make balance then it's not tough to learn it.\nI loved it!"

It's totally worth the price. Should work a bit more on its promotion and publicity.\nRecently I went after like 5-7 years, the sad part is that the total skating time has now been decreased. Now it is 2 hrs per batch."

              "reviewText": "Jakhu Temple is one of the most historically significant and ancient temples in Shimla, dedicated to Lord Hanuman. Situated at the highest point in the city, the temple offers panoramic views and a peaceful spiritual atmosphere. The massive statue of Lord Hanuman, which towers over the skyline, is the main attraction and can be seen from various parts of Shimla.\n\nYou can reach the temple via private taxi, shared taxi, ropeway, or by trekking. However, the trek is quite steep and physically demanding—best suited for experienced trekkers.\n\nA word of caution: The area is full of monkeys who are known to snatch anything they can get—sunglasses, food, bags—so be extremely careful and avoid carrying anything in your hands.\n\nThis is a place you simply should not miss when visiting Shimla—for both its spiritual significance and the breathtaking views."

The temple houses a towering 108-foot statue of Hanuman, visible from afar and one of the world's tallest at this altitude. Monkeys roam freely, adding a playful element (be cautious!). Enjoy panoramic Himalayan views and a spiritual ambiance. Reachable by a scenic walk, taxi, or ropeway for breathtaking aerial vistas. A blend of mythology, faith, and natural beauty awaits."

Climbing the stairs takes time and effort.\n\nAlso, watch out for drivers who might drop you far to avoid narrow roads — insist they go as close as possible. We almost had to walk 2 km uphill, which could take 2 hours!\n\nOverall, a must-visit spot in Shimla — just plan smart."

              "reviewText": "Jakhu Temple is an ancient temple in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India , which is dedicated to Lord Hanuman and is situated on the highest point in the Shimla city, on the top of the Jakhu hill.\nWe can reach the temple via private taxi, shared taxi, ropeway, or by trekking. However, the trek is quite steep and stamina sapping. Additionally, while walking up to the temple and nearby, the place is  full of monkeys who are known to snatch anything they can get—sunglasses, food, bags.\nAround a decade back, a massive , tall statue of Lord Hanuman, which towers over the skyline, has been installed near the temple . This has now become a star attraction of the place and is also visible from various parts of Shimla city.\nThis giant 108-feet-high idol of Hanuman was unveiled at Jakhu Hanuman temple on 4 November 2010.\nThe 108-foot-high statue of Hanuman at the famous Jakhu temple was built by JHS Svendgaard Laboratories, India's largest oral care products manufacturers, and the HC Nanda Trust. It is said that the reinforced concrete Hanuman idol had been built at a cost of Rs. 1.5 crores.\nSince several trees and foliage was cut to make space for the statue , the environmentalists and old-time residents of the town, however, were not happy with the development since they felt that the statue has spoiled Shimla's lush green skyline that is streaked with deodar and oak forests. It is around 2.5 kilometres from the Ridge at a height of 2,455 metres above the sea level.\nThe giant 108-feet-high idol of Hanuman was unveiled at Jakhu Hanuman temple on 4 November 2010, by Abhishek Bachhan.\nThe Jakhu Ropeway to the temple is an aerial lift that links a point near the centre of Shimla to the temple. It was developed by Jagson International Limited and opened in 2017.\nAs the story goes, when Lakshmana was struck and rendered unconscious by Meghnath's powerful arrow, Lord Hanuman swiftly flew towards the Himalayas through the sky to fetch the life-saving herb, Sanjeevani Booti. During his flight, he saw Yaksha Rishi, who was meditating on the Jakhu Hill.\nOver time, the name of the place evolved from Yaksha → Yak → Yaku → Jaku, eventually becoming Jakhu.\nHanuman ji descended onto the hill to gain more knowledge about the herb from the saint. The force of his landing was such that the once-towering Jakhu Hill was pushed halfway into the earth. After obtaining the information about the herb, Lord Hanuman resumed his mission towards the Dronagiri mountain. The spot where he had landed still bears his sacred footprints, which are preserved in a small marble shrine behind the main temple.\nBefore leaving, Hanuman promised Yaksha Rishi that he would return the same way. However, because of urgency, Hanuman took a shorter route back, bypassing the Jakhu Hill. The waiting Rishi, distressed by Hanuman's absence, became anxious. It was then that Hanuman appeared to the Rishi, explained the reason for not returning as promised, and after this divine interaction, immediately disappeared. Shortly afterward, a \"Self-manifested (Swayambhu) idol of Hanuman\" appeared at the very spot, which is still enshrined in the temple today.\nIt is a steep trek of about 30-45 minutes from the Ridge. However it takes around 6 minutes by the rope way, which charges Rs. 500/- per person for the round trip.\nThe temple is also accessible through narrow roads by car or shared cabs.\nThe nearest airport is Jubbarhatti Airport, located around 22 kilometres from Shimla. From the airport, we can hire a taxi or take a bus to reach Shimla. The nearest railway station is Shimla Railway Station on the Kalka-Shimla toy train.\nBeware of the monkeys around the temple."

The edifice was completed and was inaugurated by Lord Reading, the then Viceroy of India, on August 27, 1925. The need of this building arose for the simple reason the British chose SHIMLA as the Summer Capital of the Imperial Govt. to save themselves from the blistering summer of Delhi. The Central Assembly had, therefore, to be provided an appropriate accommodation. The construction of the building was started in 1920. The Council Chamber was incidently one of the last important buildings to be built by the British and it was completed at the cost of approx Rs. 10 lacs."

This iconic structure is not just a church but has become an identity for Shimla due to its historic existence, architecture and prime location.\nThe moment we reach the Ridge, the Neo-Gothic architecture of Christ Church immediately draws our eyes . Its yellow facade with a clock tower, against the background of the Himalayan peaks, simply looks amazing. This church is a living legacy of the British Times.\nIt is said that the Christ Church, of Shimla is the second oldest church in North India after the St. John’s Church in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh.\nWorship here is conducted both in Hindi and English. The Church is affiliated to the Church of North India.\nShimla was mostly forest when the Europeans first came to the hills in 1820s. They sought permission from the Raja of Keonthal, under whose state much of Simla area fell, to build their residences and then built this church in the year 1857.\nThe Christ Church was designed by Colonel J. T Boileau in 1844, and the cornerstone was laid on 9 September 1844 by Bishop Daniel Wilson, who was the Bishop of Calcutta. The church was consecrated on 10 January 1857 by Bishop Thomas Daltrey,  who was the Bishop of Madras. The estimated cost of construction at that time was around Rs. 50,000/-. The clock on the Christ Church was donated by Colonel  Dumbleton in 1860. A British made pipe-organ was installed in 1899.\nThe first Indian Chaplain of Christ Church Shimla was Rev. B.S. Chander (1948 to 1957).\nChrist Church continues to be well maintained and is in relatively good condition. The clock's original mechanical mechanism has been replaced with an electrical one .\nThe church is lit at night to illuminate it. The church has five stained glass windows and it houses the largest pipe organ in the Indian subcontinent.\nEven now the Church continues to serve as a place of worship for the Christians in Shimla and remains a cherished landmark and tourist attraction. There is no entry fees.\nThe height of the Christ Church is around 90 feet. There are several paintings inside the Church, which portray the life story of Jesus Christ.\nThe Christ Church is open from 10:30 AM to 1:00 PM and from 2:15 PM to 5:30 PM every day."

As a Level 9 Google Local Guide, I found this place to be one of the most well-preserved and informative heritage sites in India.\n\n🕰️ History & Heritage:\nBuilt in 1888, this magnificent British-era structure served as the residence of the Viceroy of India. Walking through its grand halls, you can almost feel the echoes of major pre-independence political decisions. It's also where the Shimla Conference of 1945 took place.\n\n🏰 Architecture & Grounds:\nThe Scottish Baronial-style architecture is jaw-dropping. From beautifully carved wooden interiors to its lush green lawns and panoramic views of the surrounding hills — every corner is a postcard. Perfect for history buffs, architecture lovers, and photographers alike.\n\n🎟️ Entry & Guide Services:\nThe guided tour inside the building is well-organized (limited to certain rooms for preservation reasons). The guides are knowledgeable and narrate history in an engaging manner. The entry ticket is reasonably priced, and students often get a discount.\n\n📸 Photo Tip:\nPhotography is allowed only outside the building, but the gardens and exteriors are more than enough to fill your camera roll!\n\n🧼 Cleanliness & Facilities:\nVery well-maintained premises. Clean restrooms, drinking water stations, and well-marked walking paths.\n\n🅿️ Parking & Access:\nAmple parking is available near the entrance. Though a bit uphill, it’s accessible by car or taxi. Wheelchair access is limited but the staff is helpful.\n\n☕ Nearby Amenities:\nThere’s a small café and bookstore inside the campus. Also close to other Shimla attractions like the State Museum and Annandale.\n\n🔁 Best Time to Visit:\nEarly mornings or late afternoons. Autumn and Spring bring out the best colors in the garden landscape.\n\n---\n\nFinal Verdict:\nWhether you're a traveler, student, or just someone seeking a peaceful retreat with a story — Viceregal Lodge is an experience, not just a destination. Highly recommended for a half-day visit in Shimla!"

              "reviewText": "An Architectural Wonder Frozen in Time\n\nIt’s hard to fathom that this remarkable structure dates back to the 1880s — a testament to both imagination and engineering far ahead of its time. At first glance, the exterior might strike you as another fort or palace, but that impression fades the moment you step inside. The interiors tell a different story altogether: walls dressed in rich teak, soaring ceilings, and regal chandeliers that echo an era of elegance and ambition.\n\nThe building carries layers of history within its silent halls — stories begging to be told. Yet, only a fraction is accessible to the public. Just three rooms are open — barely 5% of the entire property. The rest remains locked away, not for mystery, but due to neglect. It’s disheartening, a stark reminder of how easily heritage slips through our fingers when not properly cherished.\n\nUnfortunately, the guided tour did little to enhance the experience. The narrative was flat and robotic, devoid of depth or passion. When I tried to dig deeper, the guide chose indifference over engagement.\n\nThere’s so much more this place could offer — if only given the attention and reverence it deserves. With proper care and storytelling, it could transform from a forgotten monument to a vibrant window into history."

However, this waterfall is entirely dependent on rainwater, so it's best to visit during or just after the rainy season. Currently, the water flow is minimal, making it less impressive.\n\nIt's a great spot for a quick picnic with family and friends. The area has a small roadside parking space, where you'll need to park your car along the road. Nestled within a small forest, the waterfall is easily accessible, and visitors can hike down to the base for the best view. The short hike takes about 20 minutes and offers a scenic experience.\n\nUntil recently, entry was free, but the forest department is now developing it into a tourist attraction with an entry fee of ₹30 per person. Since there are no shops or facilities nearby, it’s advisable to carry your own water and snacks. Right now, the trail is covered with vibrant red flowers, creating a stunning \"red carpet\" effect along the path. Sharing a few pictures for reference!"

Welcome to the club.\nI honestly wondered why I took this adventure in the first place.\nThe best part is a barely there waterfall. It reminds me of all the times I had worked hard, failed, and yet felt drained and happy at the same time.\nThe trail’s great though. Echo a big “wooohuuu!” when you reach. it does feel amazing."

It's a place that makes you pause, breathe, and simply be. Whether you come alone, with friends, or with a heart full of thoughts, the fall listens without words and heals without effort.\n\nLocals know its magic, but to those who discover it for the first time, it feels like stumbling upon a secret written in nature’s own language.\n\nIf you ever long to feel real peace  not in a book, not in a screen, but in your soul  Chadwick Falls is waiting."

              "reviewText": "Shimla Kali Bari is truly a divine and peaceful place that offers much more than just a temple visit. Located very close to Mall Road, it’s easily accessible on foot and serves as a perfect escape from the tourist rush while still being centrally located. This temple, dedicated to Goddess Kali, is not only a place of worship but also a spiritual sanctuary filled with calm, devotion, and tradition.\n\nThe temple holds immense significance, especially for Bengali devotees, as it was originally established in the early 19th century by Bengali followers of Maa Kali. The architecture reflects classic Bengali temple design—simple yet graceful. The idol of Maa Kali is beautifully adorned and worshipped with great devotion. The spiritual energy inside the temple is strong, yet incredibly soothing.\n\nWhat adds to the uniqueness of this place is that Shimla Kali Bari also offers accommodation facilities. There is a Dharamshala/guest house within the temple premises, which is affordable, clean, and safe. It is especially convenient for solo travelers, families, or elderly visitors who are looking for budget-friendly and centrally located lodging. The rooms are basic but well-maintained, and the surroundings are quiet, making it ideal for a peaceful stay.\n\nIn addition to lodging, simple vegetarian food (Bengali-style bhog or meals) is often served to the guests and devotees, especially during festivals or on special puja days. The food is homemade, clean, and served with devotion. However, for regular meals, there are plenty of restaurants and eateries nearby on Mall Road and The Ridge, just a short walk away. So both traditional temple prasad and outside dining options are easily accessible.\n\nDuring festivals like Durga Puja, Kali Puja, and Diwali, the temple becomes even more vibrant and colorful with beautiful decorations, lighting, bhajans, and cultural programs. The community vibe during these times is truly heartwarming, and it’s an amazing way to witness the cultural richness of Bengali traditions in the hills of Himachal.\n\nOverall, Shimla Kali Bari is much more than a temple – it offers a full spiritual and cultural experience, complete with stay, food, and soul-soothing surroundings. Whether you’re a devotee, a traveler, or someone simply looking to connect with inner peace, this is a must-visit destination in Shimla."

Some statues were really strange as they were randomly made. They should include more statues and also need to improve the ambiance or theme of the place to justify its price."

The museum is stunning, highly photogenic, and has an international feel. It is impeccably clean, surrounded by lush greenery, and undoubtedly one of the most beautiful museums I have visited in India. Located about 4 km from Kachi Ghati, Shimla, the entry fee is ₹50 per person. However, if you wish to take pictures, an additional ₹100 charge applies for mobile cameras—without it, photography is not allowed. I highly recommend getting the camera ticket, as the museum houses an extensive collection spanning centuries, filling you with awe and joy. The staff is exceptionally polite and helpful. To explore the entire collection properly, you’ll need at least two hours. This is a great place to visit with family, especially for those with kids. The museum also offers wheelchair- ♿ accessible parking 🅿️ and entrance, ensuring convenience for all visitors."

The entry ticket was just ₹20, offering access to a treasure trove of history and culture. Inside, the museum showcases an incredible collection of sculptures, miniature paintings, traditional costumes, and artifacts that give a deep insight into Himachal Pradesh’s heritage.\n\nThe surroundings of the museum are equally impressive—well-maintained lawns and outdoor sculptures make for a serene atmosphere. The museum, located on a hill, also provides beautiful views of Shimla, and the peaceful environment allowed me to explore everything at my own pace."

But there is one more option, One can drop the passengers inside and then park the vehicle outside.\nTicket is 100 rs per person which includes a guided tour inside the building of half an hour.\nOverall, Best place in Shimla to experience in my opinion."

There is 200rs ticket for the entry in this premise..

This institution is closed on Monday.\n2. Taxi service from Shimla is closed on Sundays."

Post independence it was the summer residence of our honorable president and was called 'Rashtrapati Niwas'. Dr. S. Radhakrishnan decided that one Rashtrapati bhawan was more than enough and converted it into an academic institution.\n\nThe architecture here is marvellous and will leave you spellbound. The whole compound is mammoth- together with the main building and the lawn. It is situated on observatory hill.\n\nThis is the first building in shimla to have electricity and has a very efficient rainwater harvesting system as well.\n\nCurrently the institute offers fellowship programs in humanities, social sciences and life sciences.\n\nThis marvel is open to public through Tuesday to Sunday at a nominal ticket fee of ₹40 for Indians and ₹85 for foreigners. This includes a guided tour of some section of the huge place and you get to revisit the historic events here - even the decision to part india and pakistan!\n\nThe fact that the building had electricity generated by steam engine driven generators blew my mind!\n\nA must visit place if you're coming to Shimla!"

If you are a person who loves history, old antique buildings, then i suggest it is a must go place! If you have some time to spend, it will be really good to sit over there, chit chat with friends or family inhaling good and pure oxygen which makes you feel relief and also makes one energetic.. There are also varieties of trees, trees with flowers and so on.. Even kids to the aged  will love the ambience.. It is situated on top of a hill so that you feel like being on a high altitude place and also that gives the best view! I think you can reach there only by road, and it is the easiest with nice and maintained roads🤗"

              "reviewText": "I recently visited Bantony Castle, and it was one of the most memorable parts of my Shimla trip. This heritage site is located near Mall Road, just a short walk from Scandal Point, yet it feels peaceful and away from the busy crowds.\n\n🏰 History & Architecture\n\nBantony Castle was built in the 1880s in classic Tudor (chalet-style) architecture — with wooden frames, sloped roofs, and old-world charm. It was originally the summer palace of the Maharaja of Sirmaur and later used by the British, then by the Himachal Police Department. Over time, it fell into disrepair, but thankfully the Himachal Pradesh government bought and restored it, opening it to the public in 2023 as a heritage and cultural center.\n\nThe restoration has kept the building’s colonial-era character intact while adding modern touches like a digital museum and beautiful landscaped lawns.\n\n🖼️ Museum Experience\n\nInside the castle is a modern digital museum that walks you through the history of Shimla — from its early days, through the British Raj, the freedom movement, and into present times. The exhibits are very well done, with touchscreen displays, 3D models, and audio guides. I particularly liked the sections on:\n•\tMahatma Gandhi’s visits to Shimla\n•\tDr. Y.S. Parmar and Himachal’s statehood journey\n•\tThe story of Satyanand Stokes and apple farming\n•\tPhotos and maps of old Shimla\n\nIt’s not a huge museum, but it’s compact, clean, and thoughtfully curated.\n\n🎆 Light & Sound Show\n\nThe light and sound show in the evening is a must-watch! It’s projected right on the castle building and beautifully narrates Shimla’s journey through time, with visuals, music, and narration by Anupam Kher (in both English and Hindi). It’s around 30 minutes long and gives you goosebumps with its storytelling. The sound and visuals are crisp, and the open-air setting adds to the charm.\n\n🌿 Surroundings & Facilities\n•\tThe castle is surrounded by well-maintained gardens and open spaces, perfect for a quiet walk or photos.\n•\tThere’s seating outside, a small amphitheatre, and a food kiosk being planned soon.\n•\tClean washrooms and drinking water available on-site.\n•\tSecurity and staff were polite and helpful.\n\n💵 Visitor Information\n•\tEntry fee: ₹50 for the museum, ₹100 for the light & sound show (totally worth it)\n•\tTimings: 10 AM to 5 PM (museum); show starts in the evening (summer: after 8 PM)\n•\tClosed on Mondays\n•\tEasily accessible by car or a short walk from Mall Road/Kali Bari temple area\n\n⸻\n\n✅ What I loved:\n•\tHistorical architecture combined with modern presentation\n•\tCalm, open environment with no crowds\n•\tInsightful and engaging exhibits\n•\tGreat for families, students, and history lovers\n•\tVery affordable and well-managed\n\n⸻\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nBantony Castle is a shining example of heritage preservation done right. It’s educational, peaceful, and visually stunning. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Shimla — especially if you want to go beyond the usual tourist spots and connect with the city’s past in a deeper way."

When I visited, it wasn’t too busy, which made the experience even more peaceful and enjoyable.\n\nIt’s a great place for a quiet walk, surrounded by history and a bit of greenery. The digital museum adds a modern touch to the visit, but even just strolling around the grounds feels refreshing. If you’re in Shimla and want a calm, scenic break away from the crowded spots, Bantony Castle is definitely worth a visit."

Had a decent cafe and a green house too. We were interested in buying souvenirs but was closed. Wonderful sculptures. Well explained detailed write ups.

While exhibits are well-curated, more interactive elements (audio guides, veteran accounts) could deepen engagement. Ideal for history buffs and casual visitors alike, though signage could be clearer.\nA serene, educational spot—don’t miss the medal gallery!"

It was a great experience for me! Got to know about a lot of stuff.\nThe museum is surrounded by well maintained flowery gardens..... and adjusent to it,  there is a lush green Golf course with surrounding scenic beauty one can only dream of.\nAs you enter, you will have to buy tickets and can carry your phones/camera....good thing is photography is allowed inside the museum, so keep collecting your memories. A place for anyone who's genuinely interested in that sort of stuff.\n\nThis is a muesum which showcases the history of Indian Army. The artifacts and antique pieces are quite good and it depicts the journey of our brave soldiers. It beautifully showcases the courage and sacrifices of Indian soldiers through well-maintained galleries filled with war artifacts, medals, weapons, uniforms, photographs, first day postal stamps, and detailed stories of heroism. One can take pics with Tank, diffrent types of Gun, RCL.\n\nHimachal gallery showcases traditional dresses, stories and details of main tourist attractions.\n\nThe  glass house houses numerous variety of cactus, crotons, flowery plants. Next to it is small children park. It’s an educational and emotional experience for both adults and children.\n\nAfter exploring all above, one feel hungry so there is a nice cafeteria where you find tasty snacks & drinks.\n\nDecent tickets price around 100₹ per person and 50₹ for children.\n\nThere is ample parking available nearby.\nVery courteous staff. My compliments to the Director and his team for very well maintaining museum.\n\nSuch a calm and peaceful place...Highly recommended place to you visit in Shimla.\n\n🇮🇳 जय हिंद 🇮🇳"

The location is along the Kalka-Shimla Highway and can be reached by road or a scenic trek.\nThis temple was constructed around 250 years ago and is devoted to Tara Devi, who  is also known as the ‘Wisdom Goddess’ in Nepal and Tibet.\nTara Devi is the wife of Hindu god Brihaspati, the God of planet Jupiter.\nThe distance between Shimla and Taradevi is about 11 kms.\nIt is one of the most visited religious places in Shimla and is around 11 kilometres from Shimla.\nTara Devi temple was built by Sen dynasty kings around 1766 A.D.\nAs said, the king Bhupendra Sen built this temple after he had a dream in which the Goddess Tara Devi asked him to build a template there so that people could have her blessings.\nThis temple was rebuilt in the year 2018 at a cost of over ₹6 crore. The wood carving on the temple has been kept as close to original ‘pahari’ style.\nThe statue of Tara Devi was installed on 20 July 2018 in the presence of 90 priests. Idols of Saraswati and Kali are also installed in the temple.\nThe Tara Devi temple has a huge campus area surrounded by big deodar trees. Visiting pilgrims have to ascend the steep winding path to the temple.\nIt has no entry fees.\nAs believed the idol of Goddess Tara was brought from West Bengal to Himachal Pradesh. According to a folklore a King from the Sen dynasty had once come to this area along with a small idol of his personal family deity in the form of a gold locket. He used to wear this ornament in his upper arm. While hunting in and around the dense jungle of Juggar, he forgot his path to go back home and fell asleep. While sleeping, he dreamt that Goddess Tara and her gatekeepers Lord Hanuman and Bhairav requested him to unveil them to people.\nImmediately, the Maharaja decided to fulfil the desires of Ma Tara and donated about 50 bighas of land to construct the temple. Thus, a temple was built here with a wooden idol of the deity for people to pray and seek blessings. After some years, another king of the same dynasty had a vision in which the Ma Tara wished to be on the hill top of Tarav Parvat. Soon, the temple was shifted there and a magnificent Ashtadhatu idol of Tara Devi was installed in the temple in the year 1825. Since then, the members of Sen dynasty follow the old traditions and worship their family Goddess on the Asthami day every year.\nLeather items including clutches, bags, shoes, wallet or other stuff is forbidden inside the temple.\nThe nearest airport to reach Tara Devi Temple is Jubbarhatti Airport, which is 22 km drive away from the destination. From there, you can look for a cab or a taxi.\nTara Devi Station, on the Kalka- Shimla Toy Train track is the closest railway station to Tara Devi Temple.\nBy road Tara Devi Temple can be reached from Shoghi, on the Kalka-Shimla road route. This road is however quite steep uphill.\nBeware of monkeys in and around the temple premises."

There are two ways to reach this sacred spot—either drive directly or take a scenic trek. We arrived in the morning and chose to trek with our group. It was a joyful journey filled with laughter and photography, and we reached the top in about three hours.\n\nThe weather at the summit was breathtaking, especially since it was a rainy day. Taken blessings from Tara Mata and enjoyed the prasad, including a delicious Himachali dham. It was a truly memorable experience, made even more special with the divine grace of Mata.\n\nIf you plan to trek here, make sure to carry an umbrella and a warm hoodie, as mountain weather can be very unpredictable.\n\nJai Tara Mata Di!"

During festivals like dusshera and durga astami a huge feast is arranged which is attended by a large number of devotees. It becomes very difficult to visit the temple during snowfall and rainy season."

              "reviewText": "Mata Tara Devi Temple is one of the most mesmerizing spots that you can visit around Shimla.\n\nThe way to reach is a bit tricky ( read risky for non-mountain drivers) and the roads are quite steep, narrow and winding. Had I known that earlier, I would have avoided taking my personal vehicle there because if 2 vehicles come face to face, one of them will have to back up. You definitely don't want to be the one to back up ( and lose momentum) if you are climbing up hill. While my Grand Vitara was loaded with 6 passengers, it took us safely up the mountain without breaking a sweat ( though all of us did hold on to our breath throughout the climb)\n\nWe reached the temple around 9.00am and were surprised to find it virtually empty. It was very peaceful out there at that time which is a rarity for Shimla travellers considering the popularity of that place.\n\nThe exterior and interiors of the temple are very nicely maintained and I understand that it has been renovated a few times.\n\nThe view is spectacular from there.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised to find a langar / bhandara open up there and did not miss out on that. The 4 course food preparation was simply great. I understand that the langar/ bhandara is open all the year round, so visit early and don't don't miss the same."

Walking through the lush greenery, I was reminded of the remarkable tale of this legendary queen and her valiant role in the first war of independence.\n\nRani Laxmi Bai, also known as the “Rani of Jhansi,” was a symbol of strength and resilience during India’s struggle against British colonial rule. Her unwavering determination and indomitable spirit continue to inspire generations. In the park, amidst the rustling leaves and fragrant blossoms, I couldn’t help but reflect on her remarkable journey.\n\nThe first war of independence, also known as the Indian Rebellion of 1857, was a pivotal moment in India’s history, and Rani Laxmi Bai played a crucial role in it. With her infant son strapped to her back, she fearlessly led her troops into battle against the British forces. The sheer bravery and sacrifice displayed by Rani Laxmi Bai during this tumultuous time are truly awe-inspiring.\n\nDelving deeper into the history of the war, I was struck by the staggering statistics and data surrounding it. The sheer magnitude of the conflict, with countless lives lost and communities upheaved, underscored the immense significance of Rani Laxmi Bai’s contributions. Her daring exploits on the battlefield, despite the odds stacked against her, exemplify the very essence of courage and resilience.\n\nAs for practical details, Rani Laxmi Park welcomes visitors with open arms, offering a tranquil escape from the hustle and bustle of everyday life. The park’s operational hours ensure that visitors can immerse themselves in its beauty at their leisure. Additionally, the best seasons to visit Shimla and Rani Laxmi Park are undoubtedly spring and summer when the weather is mild, and the surroundings are ablaze with colorful blooms.\n\nIn conclusion, my visit to Rani Laxmi Park was not just a journey through verdant landscapes but also a poignant tribute to a remarkable historical figure. Rani Laxmi Bai’s legacy continues to resonate, reminding us all of the power of courage, resilience, and unwavering determination in the face of adversity."

This church looks older and gives you the feeling of how things were in the past. It is open for everyone, and you can sit inside quietly for as long as you want. There are no strict entry limits like in Christ Church. The place is calm, less crowded, and also gives a great view of Shimla. If you want peace and a true church experience, do visit this one."

Entry fee is Rs 150 per head but negotiate the price for e-cart.\nThis relatively unknown attraction of Shimla is generally missed by the tourists but is hundred times better than Kufri. At the water reservoir, you can have a small picnic but bring your own food and tea as there are no shops inside the sanctuary (please make sure not to leave any waste behind). If you are lucky, you may see the wildlife including birds but even without that, the natural beauty of the dense forest will captivate you."

              "reviewText": "The Shimla Water Catchment Sanctuary, located in the picturesque hill station of Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, is a pristine natural reserve that plays a crucial role in preserving the region’s water resources. Spanning over 3,100 hectares, the sanctuary serves as the primary catchment area for Shimla's water supply, making it vital for both ecological balance and the sustenance of the town’s population. Established in 1976, this sanctuary is situated amidst the beautiful Shivalik hills, with lush green forests and a diverse array of flora and fauna.\n\nFlora and Fauna: The sanctuary is rich in biodiversity, with dense forests primarily consisting of oak, pine, deodar, and rhododendron trees. It is home to several species of wildlife, including Himalayan Monals, Leopards, Wild Boars, and Sambar Deer, though sightings are relatively rare due to the sanctuary’s dense vegetation. The area also supports various smaller mammals, reptiles, and over 150 species of birds, making it a great destination for birdwatchers and nature enthusiasts.\n\nTrekking and Activities: The Shimla Water Catchment Sanctuary offers a range of trekking opportunities for outdoor lovers. Trails lead visitors through shaded forest paths, providing beautiful views of the surrounding hills and valleys. The sanctuary is known for its tranquility, making it an ideal location for those seeking solitude amidst nature. While there aren’t many established tourist facilities, its natural beauty and calm atmosphere make it a peaceful retreat.\n\nConservation: As the primary water source for Shimla, conservation efforts within the sanctuary are paramount. Human activities, such as construction and encroachments, pose threats to the ecosystem, but ongoing efforts aim to maintain the sanctuary’s health.\n\nOverall, the Shimla Water Catchment Sanctuary is a serene, ecologically significant destination that offers a perfect escape for nature lovers, while also playing a crucial role in sustaining the water resources of the region."

We rented bicycles and rode approximately 14 km through the sanctuary. The journey took us along a narrow road flanked by majestic deodar trees, which created a stunning and serene backdrop. The tranquility of the sanctuary, combined with the breathtaking scenery, made the trip absolutely worthwhile. The peaceful environment and the beauty of nature left us feeling refreshed and invigorated. I highly recommend this experience to anyone seeking adventure and a deep connection with nature."

This is a narrow path with a deep cliff to one side. This is a disaster waiting to happen if they are going to let cars tread this trail.\n\nThese are pictures taken on June 9th."

As for the pricing. We were charged 150 for normal visitor, 300 for foreigner and an unexpected 100 rupees for the GoPro we took along.\n\nIn my opinion, one should never be charged to take a camera along, as it should be given that pictures will be taken on the hike.\n\nBicycles were normally 200, but they only provided the expensive option of 400 rupees per person. We obviously did not use the bikes for that exact reason.\n\n50 rupees for parking."

There were very few people which meant we could really experience the quiet solitude of nature, with birds chirping and views of the pine valleys. The full trail is 15 km (to the water reserve and back). We didn't know much about wildlife and didn't see any, though I imagine it's a great place for birding. The water reserve is not picturesque but the trail there is beautiful. We rented cycles (not the best quality) for 300/each and biked the 15 km (it was pretty flat and easy to cycle)."

Beginning near the Ridge, this aerial lift provides breathtaking panoramic views of Shimla town, the surrounding green valleys, and the majestic Himalayan peaks during its approximately 6-minute ride. It's a particularly appealing option for those who prefer to avoid the steep walk or drive up to the temple.\nThe well-maintained gondolas can comfortably accommodate up to six passengers, ensuring a pleasant and secure journey. Safety is a priority, with the ropeway equipped with multiple safety devices and continuous CCTV monitoring. As you ascend, you'll be treated to stunning bird's-eye perspectives of the forests and the sprawling landscape of Shimla. The lower station is conveniently located near the Shiwalik Hotel, making it easily accessible from the main parts of the city. Upon reaching the top station, you'll find yourself within the premises of the revered Jakhu Temple.\nThe Jakhu Ropeway operates from approximately 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM or 6:00 PM daily. Ticket prices for a round trip are ₹500 for adults. One-way tickets are also available at roughly half the price. Children below 3 years usually ride for free. While online booking might be available through some platforms, tickets can also be purchased directly at the ropeway counter. This ropeway not only serves as a mode of transport to the temple but also as a delightful sightseeing experience in itself, offering memorable views of the \"Queen of Hills.\""

I am giving 4 stars just because I feel that it is a bit costly, 500 for one round trip. I just wish it had been a bit longer, it ended too quickly, and I would have enjoyed spending more time up there.  I will suggest that, seat on the right hand side of the trolley to enjoy the views."

Previously the temple was approachable only by walking on a steep, stamina sapping road from near the Church on the Mall Road, but later shared taxis and cars started running.\nOf late, a ropeway has been started from near the Ridge which drops us to a point, which is hardly 100 metres from the Jakhu Temple.\nThis ropeway, which is operated by a private company, M/S Jagson International Ltd. , was inaugurated by by Sh, Virbhadra Singh, the then Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh on 10/04/2017.\nVisitors to the Jakhu Temple can take a ride on this Gondola which passes through the Shimla Hills, Shimla town, and the forests.\nWith only a short 6 minutes ride, one can easily reach the Jakhu Temple while enjoying the beauty of forests.\nIt is said that this is one of the safest ropeway in all over india which has 48 safety devices fitted on the ropeway and all the movements of ropeway is monitored by CCTV at control room, but the astonishing part is that -\nThe Certificate of Fitness which has been prominently displayed, states that the periodical inspection of this Jakhoo Ropeway has been carried out by the Inspector Ropeway cum-Executive Engineer Mechanical of Division HPPWD, Dhalli on dated 03-06-2025 and the Ropeway has been found fit for the public use.\nThis certificate dated 03-06-2025 is not on the Letter Head of the Issuing Officer and nor has been signed by him and marked with a seal. (Photo of this dubious certificate is attached) It does not specifying the validity of the fitness period.\nCabin Capacity of the Jakhu Ropeway is 6 passengers in each gondola. The Lower Station is situated near Shivalik Hotel U.S club, Shimla and the top station is situated in the premises of Jakhu Temple.\nElderly people and those short of time would definitely love their ride on the Cable Car to the temple.\nThe price for the Jakhu Ropeway ride is :-\nRs. 500/- to and fro ride for Adults\nRs. 270/- one way for Adults\nRs. 400/- to and fro ride for children (3 to 12 years)\nRs. 210/- one way for children (3 to 12 years)\nFor Children below 3 years the ride is free.\nFrom the Ridge the distance to the Jakhu Ropeway Station and the ticket counter is around half a Kilometre away. Both at the Starting Station below , and the destination station at the temple, the Ropeway company has built big waiting halls with sitting arrangements and small cafeteria shops. After buying the tickets, we are required to wait in these halls, till we are asked to move towards the Gondolas.\nBeware of the monkeys around the Ropeway Stations."

I could see the entire city of Shimla from the top and it was an incredible experience. The fresh air and peaceful atmosphere made for a perfect escape from the busy city life.\n\nJakhu Hill also has a temple dedicated to Lord Hanuman, which is a popular pilgrimage site for Hindu devotees. According to legend, Lord Hanuman rested on this hill after his journey from the Himalayas with the Sanjeevani herb. It is said that the imprints of Lord Hanuman's feet are still visible at the temple and are considered to be sacred by many."

From dhaba to an amazing restaurant (Cafe Under Tree) you will get everything. There is a lot of place to sit and enjoy the view. Be careful of the monkeys although they didn't bug us much, but we saw two incidents where they went after food and sorta scared the people. Please don't litter around here. As, the monkeys tend to pick it up and spread it more. Apart from monkeys nothing will stop you from enjoying the view and on a cold winter day luckily we got the sun and it was seriously mesmerizing and warming. We would love to visit again. ❤️"

The temple is located at the height of 8050 ft. There are 3 ways of reaching the temple, first on foot(quite a height to climb) second by taking a taxi (easiest) and third is by ropeway (costlier and quicker). The view from the hilltop is simply mesmerizing. Go there when in Shimla."

              "reviewText": "Jakhu Temple is an ancient temple in Shimla, Himachal Pradesh, India , which is dedicated to Lord Hanuman and is situated on the highest point in the Shimla city, on the top of the Jakhu hill.\nWe can reach the temple via private taxi, shared taxi, ropeway, or by trekking. However, the trek is quite steep and stamina sapping. Additionally, while walking up to the temple and nearby, the place is  full of monkeys who are known to snatch anything they can get—sunglasses, food, bags.\nAround a decade back, a massive , tall statue of Lord Hanuman, which towers over the skyline, has been installed near the temple . This has now become a star attraction of the place and is also visible from various parts of Shimla city.\nThis giant 108-feet-high idol of Hanuman was unveiled at Jakhu Hanuman temple on 4 November 2010.\nThe 108-foot-high statue of Hanuman at the famous Jakhu temple was built by JHS Svendgaard Laboratories, India's largest oral care products manufacturers, and the HC Nanda Trust. It is said that the reinforced concrete Hanuman idol had been built at a cost of Rs. 1.5 crores.\nSince several trees and foliage was cut to make space for the statue , the environmentalists and old-time residents of the town, however, were not happy with the development since they felt that the statue has spoiled Shimla's lush green skyline that is streaked with deodar and oak forests. It is around 2.5 kilometres from the Ridge at a height of 2,455 metres above the sea level.\nThe giant 108-feet-high idol of Hanuman was unveiled at Jakhu Hanuman temple on 4 November 2010, by Abhishek Bachhan.\nThe Jakhu Ropeway to the temple is an aerial lift that links a point near the centre of Shimla to the temple. It was developed by Jagson International Limited and opened in 2017.\nAs the story goes, when Lakshmana was struck and rendered unconscious by Meghnath's powerful arrow, Lord Hanuman swiftly flew towards the Himalayas through the sky to fetch the life-saving herb, Sanjeevani Booti. During his flight, he saw Yaksha Rishi, who was meditating on the Jakhu Hill.\nOver time, the name of the place evolved from Yaksha → Yak → Yaku → Jaku, eventually becoming Jakhu.\nHanuman ji descended onto the hill to gain more knowledge about the herb from the saint. The force of his landing was such that the once-towering Jakhu Hill was pushed halfway into the earth. After obtaining the information about the herb, Lord Hanuman resumed his mission towards the Dronagiri mountain. The spot where he had landed still bears his sacred footprints, which are preserved in a small marble shrine behind the main temple.\nBefore leaving, Hanuman promised Yaksha Rishi that he would return the same way. However, because of urgency, Hanuman took a shorter route back, bypassing the Jakhu Hill. The waiting Rishi, distressed by Hanuman's absence, became anxious. It was then that Hanuman appeared to the Rishi, explained the reason for not returning as promised, and after this divine interaction, immediately disappeared. Shortly afterward, a \"Self-manifested (Swayambhu) idol of Hanuman\" appeared at the very spot, which is still enshrined in the temple today.\nIt is a steep trek of about 30-45 minutes from the Ridge. However it takes around 6 minutes by the rope way, which charges Rs. 500/- per person for the round trip.\nThe temple is also accessible through narrow roads by car or shared cabs.\nThe nearest airport is Jubbarhatti Airport, located around 22 kilometres from Shimla. From the airport, we can hire a taxi or take a bus to reach Shimla. The nearest railway station is Shimla Railway Station on the Kalka-Shimla toy train.\nBeware of the monkeys around the temple."

Climbing the stairs takes time and effort.\n\nAlso, watch out for drivers who might drop you far to avoid narrow roads — insist they go as close as possible. We almost had to walk 2 km uphill, which could take 2 hours!\n\nOverall, a must-visit spot in Shimla — just plan smart."
