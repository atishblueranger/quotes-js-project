The uphill walk takes around 10 minutes and is fairly manageable, though a bit of a workout. For those who prefer a more comfortable ascent, autos are readily available at the base of the hill, and you can also drive up with your own vehicle.\n\nThe view from the top is absolutely stunning - a panoramic sweep of the surrounding area that makes the climb worthwhile. What makes this spot even more special is the presence of not just the church, but also a mosque and a shrine nearby, all coexisting peacefully on the same hill. It adds a unique spiritual and cultural charm to the place.\n\nWhether you're looking to spend some quiet time in reflection, take in the view, or just enjoy a peaceful walk, Rose Hill Church is a great spot to unwind. Highly recommended for a relaxing outing.",

It's not just a museum – it feels like stepping into a preserved piece of living history.\n\nThe submarine itself is compact and impressive. As you move through the narrow corridors and peek into the control rooms, torpedo bays, and sleeping quarters, you can't help but admire the bravery and discipline of the crew who once lived and worked here for months at a time.\nThe museum staff, many of whom are ex-navy personnel, do an excellent job explaining the submarine's operations and sharing fascinating stories about life under the sea.\n\nFrom a technical, historical, and emotional perspective, the INS Kursura offers a deeply enriching experience. It's also beautifully maintained, right by the beach, making it a perfect blend of education and a day out by the sea.\n\nTip: Visit in the evening for a cooler experience and enjoy the illuminated view of the submarine at night!",

It was an exciting and educational experience for our whole family. The museum is centered around the decommissioned TU 142M aircraft, a long-range maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft used by the Indian Navy.\n\nThe aircraft, now on display, has been beautifully preserved. We were amazed by its massive size and advanced features for its time. Inside the museum, there are several informative exhibits about the aircraft's history, its role in Indian defense, and the technology used. The children especially enjoyed the interactive screens and videos that explained how the aircraft operated.\n\nThe museum is well-maintained, with clean surroundings and helpful staff. We also appreciated the neatly arranged photo gallery and the short documentary that gave us more insights into naval aviation.\n\nOverall, it was a fun and educational outing for all of us. The visit gave us a sense of pride in our nation's defense achievements. We highly recommend the TU 142 Museum to families visiting Vizag – it's a great combination of learning and enjoyment.👌👍🤝🤝🤝🥰",

He was very kind and hospitable and spoke very well and was happy to see the old students in the campus. The building was well maintained and brought back excellent memories. I still remember the majestic arches and the classrooms, very big, spacious, with huge windows for light and fresh air. I thank God for giving me this opportunity to visit such an esteemed college.

Even the Qutub shah heritage park in Hyderabad spread out over several acres has only one heritage center and it is much much smaller. why do they need two buildings on this hill? It is not even on the beach road! they pocketed public funds with help from the builder. The ultimate joke is now the centers have turned in to bigger ruins than the original Buddhist excavations on this hill.",

There's some space to park your vehicle just outside the site's entrance.\n\nThe site, per se, is a marvel of those days! Those familiar with Buddhism and history would be able to appreciate it in its entirety. However, the site needs upkeep - more information boards, proper gates, and personnel. I spotted a few visitors walking on the ancient structures; although I asked them not to, there's clearly a need for security personnel.\n\nThotlakonda, on the other hand, was very well maintained.\n\nHope the Archaeology Department steps in.",

I would like to share my experience with you all.\n\nTwo years back when I visited they gave nice treatment but unfortunately when I visited the op dept(op gate) recently , I observed a lot of delay while giving treatment to the patient.\n\nWe can see mostly junior doctors/trainees from AP medical college on the floor of op department while giving treatment. It's very hard to find senior doctors on the floor especially on the weekends.\n\nDue to lack of experience and knowledge junior doctors take a lot of time for decision making to give what kind of treatment to patient. If there is a senior doctor on the floor, all junior doctors are following them and leaving some of the patients.\n\nSome of the patients come for general and normal problems but jr. Doctors unable to tell where to go. They simply say sit on the bed and we'll come and see. Even after an hour also they said give us sometime, we'll  come.\n\nComing to the lab and report related, jr.doctor not sure exactly what is the problem . At the time these doctors sending the images/reports through WhatsApp and asking the decision. Then senior doctors  sending medical description and suggestions what to do. Then jr.doctors convey the same thing to patients.\n\nHere I have seen some doctors, crossing their limits and giving lectures to the patients. Even they call other doctors in a disrespectful manner in front of patients.\n\nDoctors prescribed medicine like 10 different tablets, out of 10 only 8 tablets giving in the medicine counters. Expensive tablets, staff asking us to buy outside. This is a government hospital they should provide free of cost.\n\nMy humble request to Government, Please looks into these issues. It could be better if you improve the hospitality and how doctors are given the treatment.",
