It turned out to be one of the most enjoyable and refreshing experiences of our trip. Known for its natural beauty and clean shoreline, Rushikonda Beach is truly a gem on the east coast.\n\nThe beach was lively yet peaceful, with golden sands and clear blue waters creating a stunning view. The gentle waves and cool breeze made it a perfect spot to relax and unwind. We spent a good amount of time walking along the shore, chatting, and soaking in the serene atmosphere.\n\nWhat made the experience even better was the scenic drive to the beach. Surrounded by lush greenery and coastal roads, the journey itself was quite beautiful. The beach is also a great place for water sports like jet skiing and surfing, which adds excitement for adventure lovers, though we mainly went there to enjoy the peaceful vibe.\n\nFood stalls near the beach served tasty local snacks, allowing us to enjoy a light meal while enjoying the sea view. The beach was clean and well-maintained, which made our visit even more pleasant.\n\nOverall, Rushikonda Beach is a must-visit destination in Vizag for anyone who loves nature, sea views, and a relaxed vibe. It was a memorable experience that I'd highly recommend to others. I would love to visit again someday.",

A lot of families with kids and friends in groups make the most of this lovely sea coast playing in the serene beaches, enjoying the water rides, taking lovely photos, riding horses, and kids collecting sea shells.\nNote that Scuba diving is open only in winters between Sep through Jan. On the other days, one can enjoy speed boats and speed scooter rides.\nNote:\nThis beach does not have a facility  to shower. The facility that AP tourism provides is mostly non- functional; most of the time, there would be no water. So please make your own arrangements. The support staff at this facility are extremely arrogant and rude. Avoid this place.\nThere would be numerous photographers reaching out to you for snaps. Be very careful dealing with them.\nAlso, please be aware that the speed boat driver would usually ask for additional money to take you a little more inside the sea - don't encourage this. This is another trick to fool tourists and make more money.",

Stepping inside the actual decommissioned submarine gives a rare and thrilling glimpse into the life of naval officers underwater. It's not just a museum – it feels like stepping into a preserved piece of living history.\n\nThe submarine itself is compact and impressive. As you move through the narrow corridors and peek into the control rooms, torpedo bays, and sleeping quarters, you can't help but admire the bravery and discipline of the crew who once lived and worked here for months at a time.\nThe museum staff, many of whom are ex-navy personnel, do an excellent job explaining the submarine's operations and sharing fascinating stories about life under the sea.\n\nFrom a technical, historical, and emotional perspective, the INS Kursura offers a deeply enriching experience. It's also beautifully maintained, right by the beach, making it a perfect blend of education and a day out by the sea.\n\nTip: Visit in the evening for a cooler experience and enjoy the illuminated view of the submarine at night!",

The timings are restricted from 3PM - 5PM only, so plan accordingly.\n\nIt is located towards the south of vizag, roughly 25km from RK beach. The way goes through industrial areas, military areas and a steep ghat road. The ghat road journey can be a little tough with sharp turns, speed breakers, steep road and bumpy patches.\n\nOnce you reach the entrance, there is a good parking area and you can buy the entry ticket. From there you need to walk around 200-300m to the main lighthouse. From there you need to climb around 70 normal steps and 10-12 steps in a ladder to reach the top.\n\nThe view is just breathtaking and very wholesome. The wind will be strong, so take care of your belongings. And walk slowly as there is less area to roam on the top. Cellphone signals will be weak here.",

It's a great spot for photography, relaxation, or simply soaking in the refreshing sea breeze. The vantage point also gives visitors a unique perspective of Vizag's natural beauty, blending hills, sea, and port views all in one frame. Do take note of the visiting time on the day of your visit. Its 3pm-5pm.\nSecurity is kind of strict in the area for obvious reasons.\n\nFor those exploring the city, the Dolphin's Nose Lighthouse is a must-visit destination to experience the scenic grandeur of the coast",

The entire coastline opens up in front of you - you can literally watch huge cargo ships, cruise liners, and even naval vessels passing by. If you're lucky, you might catch a submarine surfacing or a naval practice session happening right in the ocean below. It feels like a live maritime show! 🚢⚓\n\nThe place is super calm, with a refreshing sea breeze and plenty of open space to just sit, relax, and take it all in. It's perfect for photography, quiet reflection, or just watching the world (and ships!) go by. Early mornings and evenings are the best time to visit - the light makes everything look golden and magical. 🌅\n\nWhether you're a tourist or a local, Rose Hill Church is a must-visit if you love scenic views, history, and the ocean. Highly recommended! 👍",

The church itself is modest but well-kept, offering a calm and quiet atmosphere perfect for reflection or a moment of silence. What sets this spot apart is the stunning vantage point. From the church grounds, you can look out over the port, city skyline, and coastline. It's especially beautiful at sunset, when the light spills over the hills and sea. The journey up the hill, though a bit steep, is worth every step for the peaceful environment and the views.",

The uphill walk takes around 10 minutes and is fairly manageable, though a bit of a workout. For those who prefer a more comfortable ascent, autos are readily available at the base of the hill, and you can also drive up with your own vehicle.\n\nThe view from the top is absolutely stunning - a panoramic sweep of the surrounding area that makes the climb worthwhile. What makes this spot even more special is the presence of not just the church, but also a mosque and a shrine nearby, all coexisting peacefully on the same hill. It adds a unique spiritual and cultural charm to the place.\n\nWhether you're looking to spend some quiet time in reflection, take in the view, or just enjoy a peaceful walk, Rose Hill Church is a great spot to unwind. Highly recommended for a relaxing outing.",

We saw a wide variety of animals including tigers, white tigers, elephants, giraffes, crocodiles, snakes, lions, deer, and even an anaconda. The kids were especially excited to see the different species of birds, peacocks, and tortoises.\n\nWe chose to explore the entire zoo on foot, which allowed us to enjoy the natural beauty and greenery all around. It was a refreshing and peaceful walk, and a great way to connect with nature while learning about wildlife.\n\nWe also visited the butterfly zone, which looked nice, but unfortunately there were no butterflies at the time. That was a bit disappointing, but overall it didn't take away from the experience.\n\nThe zoo is well-maintained and perfect for a family outing. My kids really enjoyed everything, and we had a great time together. Highly recommended for a fun and educational day out in nature",
