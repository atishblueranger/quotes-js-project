Just be cautious on those roads. 😉"

Cleanliness is severely lacking, and the water quality is poor, making it an unappealing spot for visitors.\n\nSwimming is not allowed, as there are multiple warning signs citing dangerous depths, which further limits the recreational appeal of this place. Overall, it's one of the worst beach experiences I've had.\n\nI sincerely hope the local authorities take action to improve the condition of the beach—both in terms of cleanliness and safety—so it can become a more enjoyable destination in the future."

The timings are restricted from 3PM - 5PM only, so plan accordingly.\n\nIt is located towards the south of vizag, roughly 25km from RK beach. The way goes through industrial areas, military areas and a steep ghat road. The ghat road journey can be a little tough with sharp turns, speed breakers, steep road and bumpy patches.\n\nOnce you reach the entrance, there is a good parking area and you can buy the entry ticket. From there you need to walk around 200-300m to the main lighthouse. From there you need to climb around 70 normal steps and 10-12 steps in a ladder to reach the top.\n\nThe view is just breathtaking and very wholesome. The wind will be strong, so take care of your belongings. And walk slowly as there is less area to roam on the top. Cellphone signals will be weak here."

However there is a small shop and bathroom but if possible bring your own thing with you."

              "reviewText": "The Dolphin’s Nose Lighthouse is one of Vizag’s hidden gems and absolutely worth a visit. Perched on a rocky headland, the lighthouse offers a spectacular panoramic view of the coastline and the vast Bay of Bengal. The sweeping sight of the blue waters meeting the rugged shoreline is truly breathtaking and makes the climb worthwhile.\n\nThe area around the lighthouse is calm and less crowded, which adds to the charm. It’s a great spot for photography, relaxation, or simply soaking in the refreshing sea breeze. The vantage point also gives visitors a unique perspective of Vizag’s natural beauty, blending hills, sea, and port views all in one frame. Do take note of the visiting time on the day of your visit. Its 3pm-5pm.\nSecurity is kind of strict in the area for obvious reasons.\n\nFor those exploring the city, the Dolphin’s Nose Lighthouse is a must-visit destination to experience the scenic grandeur of the coast"

              "reviewText": "Dolphin's Nose Lighthouse: A Vizag Gem with Room for Improvement (and a Few Quirks)\n\nDolphin's Nose Lighthouse offers an undeniably nice atmosphere with amazing views that are well worth the visit. Perched atop the iconic Dolphin's Nose hill, the panoramic vistas of the Bay of Bengal, the sprawling Vizag coastline, and the surrounding lush greenery are simply breathtaking. It's a fantastic spot to enjoy the sea breeze, capture stunning photographs, and simply soak in the natural beauty of the region.\nHowever, the experience does come with a few notable caveats. During my visit, the entry was open but the lighthouse itself was not accessible, and there was no explanation provided. This was quite disappointing, as the opportunity to explore the lighthouse interior and potentially ascend for an even higher vantage point is a significant draw. Clear signage or a staff member on hand to explain the closure would greatly enhance the visitor experience.\nThere is a nominal entry fee of ₹10 per person, which is quite reasonable for the views on offer. A practical point to note for future visitors is that only cash is accepted for entry fees. In an increasingly digital world, the lack of UPI or other e-commerce payment provisions feels outdated and inconvenient. Having to scramble for cash can detract from the initial excitement of arrival.\nAdditionally, should the lighthouse be open during your visit, be prepared to remove your shoes for entry. While this isn't a major inconvenience, it's good to be aware of beforehand, especially if you're wearing footwear that's difficult to slip on and off.\nDespite these minor frustrations and quirks, the sheer beauty of the location makes Dolphin's Nose Lighthouse a recommended stop in Vizag. If the operational aspects, particularly the consistent accessibility of the lighthouse and payment options, could be improved, it would undoubtedly elevate this already picturesque destination to a truly top-tier attraction."

The entire coastline opens up in front of you — you can literally watch huge cargo ships, cruise liners, and even naval vessels passing by. If you’re lucky, you might catch a submarine surfacing or a naval practice session happening right in the ocean below. It feels like a live maritime show! 🚢⚓\n\nThe place is super calm, with a refreshing sea breeze and plenty of open space to just sit, relax, and take it all in. It’s perfect for photography, quiet reflection, or just watching the world (and ships!) go by. Early mornings and evenings are the best time to visit — the light makes everything look golden and magical. 🌅\n\nWhether you’re a tourist or a local, Rose Hill Church is a must-visit if you love scenic views, history, and the ocean. Highly recommended! 👍"

The church itself is modest but well-kept, offering a calm and quiet atmosphere perfect for reflection or a moment of silence. What sets this spot apart is the stunning vantage point. From the church grounds, you can look out over the port, city skyline, and coastline. It’s especially beautiful at sunset, when the light spills over the hills and sea. The journey up the hill, though a bit steep, is worth every step for the peaceful environment and the views."

The uphill walk takes around 10 minutes and is fairly manageable, though a bit of a workout. For those who prefer a more comfortable ascent, autos are readily available at the base of the hill, and you can also drive up with your own vehicle.\n\nThe view from the top is absolutely stunning — a panoramic sweep of the surrounding area that makes the climb worthwhile. What makes this spot even more special is the presence of not just the church, but also a mosque and a shrine nearby, all coexisting peacefully on the same hill. It adds a unique spiritual and cultural charm to the place.\n\nWhether you’re looking to spend some quiet time in reflection, take in the view, or just enjoy a peaceful walk, Rose Hill Church is a great spot to unwind. Highly recommended for a relaxing outing."

With a mosque, a temple and the church all on the same hill, this holds mirror to the peace & harmony the city thrives on.\n\nIt's not just the views that are spectacular but perhaps the thousands of prayers that rise up to heaven from this place is what makes it a safe haven for a tired soul. Oh and the stunning photogenic vistas too!"

We saw a wide variety of animals including tigers, white tigers, elephants, giraffes, crocodiles, snakes, lions, deer, and even an anaconda. The kids were especially excited to see the different species of birds, peacocks, and tortoises.\n\nWe chose to explore the entire zoo on foot, which allowed us to enjoy the natural beauty and greenery all around. It was a refreshing and peaceful walk, and a great way to connect with nature while learning about wildlife.\n\nWe also visited the butterfly zone, which looked nice, but unfortunately there were no butterflies at the time. That was a bit disappointing, but overall it didn’t take away from the experience.\n\nThe zoo is well-maintained and perfect for a family outing. My kids really enjoyed everything, and we had a great time together. Highly recommended for a fun and educational day out in nature"

The zoo is now home to a wide variety of animals, and the overall experience has been significantly upgraded.\n\nThe infrastructure is impressive, with beautifully maintained greenery throughout. There are plenty of benches and shaded areas under large trees, making it a very comfortable place to rest as you explore.\n\nDespite the hot weather outside, the zoo felt pleasantly cool thanks to the abundance of trees and plants, which really enhance the environment and provide a natural cooling effect.\n\nThe zoo also has free drinking water stations at multiple spots, which is a thoughtful and much-needed facility, especially during warmer months.\n\nThere’s a canteen inside the zoo too. I tried the chicken biryani, which was surprisingly tasty. They also serve meals, though I found those to be just average in taste.\n\nFor convenience, the zoo offers traveller vehicles and electric cycles, which are great for covering the large area without getting too tired.\n\nOverall, it’s a fantastic place to hang out with family or friends. Whether you're there for the animals, the peaceful greenery, or just a relaxing day out, this zoo has truly become a great destination. Highly recommended!\n\nThe best visit time is around 11 to 11:30 AM as it is the feeding time for the animals."

It’s a great learning experience, especially for kids.\n\n✅ Good Environment – The park is spacious, and walking around gives you a real jungle-like feel.\n\n⚠️ Suggestion for Improvement: In the parrot section, the birds are not clearly visible due to white glass panels. It would be better if they used mesh or transparent barriers instead, to allow better viewing while ensuring safety.\n\nOverall, a great outing spot with lots to see and learn. With a few small improvements, it can become one of the best zoological parks in the region!\n\nLet me know if you'd like this translated or shortened for social media posts!"

Spread out across a large area, it features a wide variety of animal exhibits that are both educational and engaging. The enclosures are generally spacious, allowing the animals to move freely and providing visitors with a closer-to-natural experience.\n\nOne of the main highlights of the zoo is undoubtedly the White Bengal Tigers. These majestic animals are a major attraction, and watching them up close is a memorable experience.\n\nVisitors can choose between driving through the zoo in their own car or opting for a personal buggy ride, which makes it convenient for families and those who prefer a guided, comfortable tour. To fully explore the zoo and its exhibits, it usually takes around 2–3 hours.\n\nAt the same time, certain sections of the zoo are undergoing upgrading and renovation works, which is a positive sign of continuous improvement. Once completed, these will further enhance the visitor experience and the welfare of the animals.\n\nOverall, Vizag Zoo strikes a fine balance between recreation and conservation, making it a great place for families, animal lovers, and tourists alike."

Stepping inside the actual decommissioned submarine gives a rare and thrilling glimpse into the life of naval officers underwater. It's not just a museum – it feels like stepping into a preserved piece of living history.\n\nThe submarine itself is compact and impressive. As you move through the narrow corridors and peek into the control rooms, torpedo bays, and sleeping quarters, you can’t help but admire the bravery and discipline of the crew who once lived and worked here for months at a time.\nThe museum staff, many of whom are ex-navy personnel, do an excellent job explaining the submarine’s operations and sharing fascinating stories about life under the sea.\n\nFrom a technical, historical, and emotional perspective, the INS Kursura offers a deeply enriching experience. It’s also beautifully maintained, right by the beach, making it a perfect blend of education and a day out by the sea.\n\nTip: Visit in the evening for a cooler experience and enjoy the illuminated view of the submarine at night!"

It's the perfect spot to escape the heat and enjoy the cool ocean breeze.\n\nI've visited many beaches in my life, but Bheemili Beach stands out for its unique blend of natural beauty, village charm, and modern amenities. Whether you're a local or just visiting, this beach is an absolute must-visit. Five stars isn't enough – I'd give it ten stars if I could!\n\n*Pros:* Pristine beach, picturesque village surroundings, newly opened Coco Arena with coco trees providing shade\n\n*Cons:* None!\n\n*Recommendation:* Head to Bheemili Beach for a day of relaxation, exploration, and fun in the sun.

The signboard outside gives a brief history of the place as well. Easily can covered in half an hour as the place is not very big."

Absolute peace and bliss!\n\nThe ghat road leading to the monastery site (atop a hill) is well maintained but has a small entry charge at the main gate. There’s some space to park vehicles up the hill, just beside the monument site.\n\nThe cluster of monuments has been very well maintained by the Archaeology Department. The plaque at the entry informs that the Indian Navy spotted this site in the 1970s while on the lookout for a suitable naval base, and its discovery has improved the understanding of Buddhism in the Eastern Ghats region. There weren’t any guides, although the security personnel offered some information.\n\nThe site is pretty self-explanatory for those familiar with history and Buddhism, but I would love to see some more curated digital media guides that could help other tourists."

It turned out to be one of the most enjoyable and refreshing experiences of our trip. Known for its natural beauty and clean shoreline, Rushikonda Beach is truly a gem on the east coast.\n\nThe beach was lively yet peaceful, with golden sands and clear blue waters creating a stunning view. The gentle waves and cool breeze made it a perfect spot to relax and unwind. We spent a good amount of time walking along the shore, chatting, and soaking in the serene atmosphere.\n\nWhat made the experience even better was the scenic drive to the beach. Surrounded by lush greenery and coastal roads, the journey itself was quite beautiful. The beach is also a great place for water sports like jet skiing and surfing, which adds excitement for adventure lovers, though we mainly went there to enjoy the peaceful vibe.\n\nFood stalls near the beach served tasty local snacks, allowing us to enjoy a light meal while enjoying the sea view. The beach was clean and well-maintained, which made our visit even more pleasant.\n\nOverall, Rushikonda Beach is a must-visit destination in Vizag for anyone who loves nature, sea views, and a relaxed vibe. It was a memorable experience that I’d highly recommend to others. I would love to visit again someday."

The    sea current is usually gentle here, with a constant watch from the security, warning tourists venturing little inside the sea. A lot of families with kids and friends in groups make the most of this lovely sea coast playing in the serene beaches, enjoying the water rides, taking lovely photos, riding horses, and kids collecting sea shells.\nNote that Scuba diving is open only in winters between Sep through Jan. On the other days, one can enjoy speed boats and speed scooter rides.\nNote:\nThis beach does not have a facility  to shower. The facility that AP tourism provides is mostly non- functional; most of the time, there would be no water. So please make your own arrangements. The support staff at this facility are extremely arrogant and rude. Avoid this place.\nThere would be numerous photographers reaching out to you for snaps. Be very careful dealing with them.\nAlso, please be aware that the speed boat driver would usually ask for additional money to take you a little more inside the sea - don't encourage this. This is another trick to fool tourists and make more money."

Whether you're a local or just visiting, this beach is an absolute must-visit. Five stars isn't enough – I'd give it ten stars if I could!\n\n*Pros:* Easily accessible, variety of food stalls, pristine beach, scenic views\n\n*Cons:* None!\n\n*Recommendation:* Visit Rushikonda Beach for a day of relaxation, fun, and sun.

It’s not a full, detailed museum — but as an outdoor memorial, it does a good job of combining solemn remembrance with scenic waterfront ambiance, making it well-suited for short visits, personal reflection, or as part of a broader beach road walk.\n\nIf you’re traveling in Visakhapatnam, especially along Beach Road, the Victory at Sea Memorial is a worthy stop: not just for its historical resonance, but also for the peaceful, contemplative space it provides next to the sea. It pairs particularly well with visits to the Ramakrishna Beach and the INS Kurusura Submarine Museum, turning the walk into both a tour and a moment of remembering the naval heritage of the city."

There’s some space to park your vehicle just outside the site’s entrance.\n\nThe site, per se, is a marvel of those days! Those familiar with Buddhism and history would be able to appreciate it in its entirety. However, the site needs upkeep — more information boards, proper gates, and personnel. I spotted a few visitors walking on the ancient structures; although I asked them not to, there’s clearly a need for security personnel.\n\nThotlakonda, on the other hand, was very well maintained.\n\nHope the Archaeology Department steps in."

Multiple varieties of fishes and tortoises are displayed here in small and medium size aquariums.\nThere is no enough space for few fishes. And turtles are literally abused by not giving enough basking areas leading to shell rots . Poor turtle . He is having severe shell rot but no one there to take care.\nThe entrance is very odd in the sense that things are clumsy and not attractive.\nDark inside; more lighting could help\nSuffocated feeling with no / poor air conditioning."

While the aquarium is clean and well-maintained, the variety of fish is quite limited. You’d expect to see a wide range of marine life, but unfortunately, there aren’t many unique or exotic species on display.\n\nFor the ticket price, it doesn’t feel entirely worth it. The experience is too short, and there’s not much to explore. If you’re visiting with kids, they might find it interesting for a while, but don’t expect anything too exciting.\n\nOverall, it’s decent for a one-time visit, but unless they add more fish and improve the exhibits, I wouldn’t recommend going out of your way to see it."

Every creature has a right to fresh air, sunlight, fresh water atleast if not medical care.\n\nIt was a heartbreaking experience visiting this place. I wonder when are humans going to be sensitized on the plight of animals."

Nestled near the historical site of Thotlakonda, this beach is a perfect blend of natural beauty and geological wonder. The highlight of my visit was the stunning natural arch at Mangamaripeta. This geological formation, sculpted by the relentless action of waves over thousands of years, is a testament to the awe-inspiring power of nature.\n\nThe beach itself is serene and less crowded, making it an ideal spot for those looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. The sound of the waves crashing against the rocks, coupled with the gentle sea breeze, creates a calming atmosphere that's perfect for relaxation. The natural arch, with its unique structure, is a photographer’s delight and a must-visit for geology enthusiasts.\n\nWalking along the shoreline, I was captivated by the pristine beauty of the surroundings. The clear waters, golden sands, and lush greenery add to the scenic charm of Thotlakonda Beach. It’s not just a place to unwind but also a reminder of the incredible natural history of the region. I would highly recommend this beach to anyone visiting Visakhapatnam—it’s a place where nature and tranquility come together beautifully."

This is a perfect example how an unfortunate incident can open the door towards positive turn of events. The bangladeshi cargo ship MV Maa ran aground during a cyclone in the year 2020 and was abandoned in the year 2021, as the owners of the ship were unable to tow it back. Since then, the ship has become a famous spot for photography, photoshoot and even filming movies. Although it’s not allowed to embark the ship, but the sight of the ship grounded on the shore is something that no one would like to miss. Overall verdict- definitely recommended."

Though they are not allowing anyone to get inside the ship as restoration work is in progress one can still have a look at the giant from outside and click few pictures and enjoy the unique sighting."

It's not just a museum – it feels like stepping into a preserved piece of living history.\n\nThe submarine itself is compact and impressive. As you move through the narrow corridors and peek into the control rooms, torpedo bays, and sleeping quarters, you can’t help but admire the bravery and discipline of the crew who once lived and worked here for months at a time.\nThe museum staff, many of whom are ex-navy personnel, do an excellent job explaining the submarine’s operations and sharing fascinating stories about life under the sea.\n\nFrom a technical, historical, and emotional perspective, the INS Kursura offers a deeply enriching experience. It’s also beautifully maintained, right by the beach, making it a perfect blend of education and a day out by the sea.\n\nTip: Visit in the evening for a cooler experience and enjoy the illuminated view of the submarine at night!"

I would like to share my experience with you all.\n\nTwo years back when I visited they gave nice treatment but unfortunately when I visited the op dept(op gate) recently , I observed a lot of delay while giving treatment to the patient.\n\nWe can see mostly junior doctors/trainees from AP medical college on the floor of op department while giving treatment. It's very hard to find senior doctors on the floor especially on the weekends.\n\nDue to lack of experience and knowledge junior doctors take a lot of time for decision making to give what kind of treatment to patient. If there is a senior doctor on the floor, all junior doctors are following them and leaving some of the patients.\n\nSome of the patients come for general and normal problems but jr. Doctors unable to tell where to go. They simply say sit on the bed and we'll come and see. Even after an hour also they said give us sometime, we'll  come.\n\nComing to the lab and report related, jr.doctor not sure exactly what is the problem . At the time these doctors sending the images/reports through WhatsApp and asking the decision. Then senior doctors  sending medical description and suggestions what to do. Then jr.doctors convey the same thing to patients.\n\nHere I have seen some doctors, crossing their limits and giving lectures to the patients. Even they call other doctors in a disrespectful manner in front of patients.\n\nDoctors prescribed medicine like 10 different tablets, out of 10 only 8 tablets giving in the medicine counters. Expensive tablets, staff asking us to buy outside. This is a government hospital they should provide free of cost.\n\nMy humble request to Government, Please looks into these issues. It could be better if you improve the hospitality and how doctors are given the treatment."

Later, shifted to KGH and they did all the required test till midnight. In the morning doctor informed us there is an internal bleed in brain and kept for 48 hrs observation. Unfortunately the bleed is persistent after two days which is heartbreaking news to us. After the surgery he recovered gradually and I appreciate the way Dr.Himanshu cared my 9 year old son and his expertise in surgery is fabulous. I want to admire Dr.Ravi garu HOD NEUROSURGERY on his professional leadership of his team.\n\nCons -\n1. The hospital needs drastic improvement in hygiene.\n2. The lower grade employees prominently male always demands money and saddest part it post surgery the OT female nurses asked(not demanded) me for a hefty amount tip(bribe).\n\nConclusion - KGH is a boon to the middle class who can't afford the corporate hospitals and who have no support from government schemes. I salute to this 180 year old monument KGH🏥."

Even the Qutub shah heritage park in Hyderabad spread out over several acres has only one heritage center and it is much much smaller. why do they need two buildings on this hill? It is not even on the beach road! they pocketed public funds with help from the builder.

There’s some space to park your vehicle just outside the site’s entrance.\n\nThe site, per se, is a marvel of those days! Those familiar with Buddhism and history would be able to appreciate it in its entirety. However, the site needs upkeep — more information boards, proper gates, and personnel. I spotted a few visitors walking on the ancient structures; although I asked them not to, there’s clearly a need for security personnel.\n\nThotlakonda, on the other hand, was very well maintained.\n\nHope the Archaeology Department steps in."

Example Alluri Seetha Rama Raju freedom fighter and the first President of India , Dr. Rajendra Prasad.Dr. CV Raman was also a student of this college. I appreciate the cleanliness of the college and the campus maintained very well. The college has a young and dynamic principal, who is responsible for the cleanliness of the college and the campus. He was very kind and hospitable and spoke very well and was happy to see the old students in the campus. The building was well maintained and brought back excellent memories. I still remember the majestic arches and the classrooms, very big, spacious, with huge windows for light and fresh air. I thank God for giving me this opportunity to visit such an esteemed college. Thank you principal sir, once again."

Five stars isn't enough – I'd give it ten stars if I could!\n\n*Pros:* Easily accessible, variety of snacks, well-maintained beach, picturesque views\n\n*Cons:* None!\n\n*Recommendation:* Head to RK Beach for a day of relaxation, fun, and sun. You won't regret it!\""

We went there around 9 PM and ended up staying until 1:30 in the morning — that’s how beautiful and peaceful the place was. Time just flew by without us even realizing it.\n\nThe night view of the beach was simply fantastic. The sound of the sea waves, the cool breeze, and the reflection of the moon on the water created a magical atmosphere. It was a perfect night for relaxation and quality family time. There were many other families there too, enjoying the calm and safe environment.\n\nMy kids had a great time playing on the sand and watching the waves. The beach was lively but not too crowded, which made it even more enjoyable. One of the best things was that even at night, there were small stalls available for snacks, tea, and coffee — perfect for keeping warm and refreshed.\n\nOverall, it was a memorable night by the sea. RK Beach is definitely a must-visit spot in Vizag, especially if you want to spend peaceful, happy moments with your loved ones. We’re already planning to come back again soon!"

The trees give it like you're actually in any tropical island kind of vibe. The beach side is well maintained with hygiene and has some sitting stuff. The place is also very photogenic where one can get a good picture with a dazzling sea view. I'd recommend this place for sure. 🏖️"

We reached the beach early in the morning to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and cool breeze. The sound of the waves and the sunrise created a beautiful and calming start to our day.\n\nHowever, one major downside was our experience with the local photographers on the beach. We were scammed by a few of them who overcharged us and delivered very poor-quality photos. Their behavior was rude and unprofessional. I strongly recommend that visitors avoid getting their pictures clicked by the beachside photographers, as most of them are not trustworthy and lack basic manners.\n\nAside from that, we had a great time. We walked along the beach, explored nearby streets, and took in the stunning coastal views. The area around the beach has a lively yet relaxed vibe. In the evening, we returned to the beach and sat by the shore, watching the waves and enjoying the cool breeze. The view during sunset was absolutely beautiful and added to the overall charm of the place.\n\nDespite the issue with the photographers, our visit to RK Beach was fun and enjoyable. It’s a great spot for both early morning and evening visits. The natural beauty of the beach is worth experiencing. Just be a bit cautious with the photographers, and you’ll have a great time."

It was an exciting and educational experience for our whole family. The museum is centered around the decommissioned TU 142M aircraft, a long-range maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft used by the Indian Navy.\n\nThe aircraft, now on display, has been beautifully preserved. We were amazed by its massive size and advanced features for its time. Inside the museum, there are several informative exhibits about the aircraft’s history, its role in Indian defense, and the technology used. The children especially enjoyed the interactive screens and videos that explained how the aircraft operated.\n\nThe museum is well-maintained, with clean surroundings and helpful staff. We also appreciated the neatly arranged photo gallery and the short documentary that gave us more insights into naval aviation.\n\nOverall, it was a fun and educational outing for all of us. The visit gave us a sense of pride in our nation’s defense achievements. We highly recommend the TU 142 Museum to families visiting Vizag – it's a great combination of learning and enjoyment.👌👍🤝🤝🤝🥰"

Located right along the beautiful RK Beach and near the iconic INS Kurusura Submarine Museum, the aircraft museum offers a fascinating glimpse into Indian Naval aviation history.\n\nThe highlight of the museum is the HAL Tupolev Tu-142M aircraft, which served the Indian Navy for nearly three decades. Standing tall and majestic, the aircraft’s sheer size is impressive and commands attention. Inside the museum, we got to explore the aircraft's interior, including its cockpit, radar systems, and sonar room, all of which are preserved to reflect its operational condition. The exhibits and displays were informative and well-organized, with plenty of background on the aircraft’s missions, technology, and history.\n\nWhat made the visit even more exciting was the proximity to the submarine museum, offering a rare chance to explore both naval air and underwater defense technology at one location. The setting by the beach added to the charm, making it perfect for a relaxed yet educational outing.\n\nThe staff was helpful, and the entry process was smooth. I’d highly recommend the 142 Aircraft Museum to anyone visiting Vizag—whether you’re an aviation enthusiast, history buff, or just looking for a unique experience by the sea. It’s a tribute to India’s naval legacy and a proud piece of maritime history."

The church itself is modest but well-kept, offering a calm and quiet atmosphere perfect for reflection or a moment of silence. What sets this spot apart is the stunning vantage point. From the church grounds, you can look out over the port, city skyline, and coastline. It’s especially beautiful at sunset, when the light spills over the hills and sea. The journey up the hill, though a bit steep, is worth every step for the peaceful environment and the views."

              "reviewText": "Rose Hill Church is a serene and picturesque destination located at the top of a hill, offering a peaceful escape from the daily hustle. The uphill walk takes around 10 minutes and is fairly manageable, though a bit of a workout. For those who prefer a more comfortable ascent, autos are readily available at the base of the hill, and you can also drive up with your own vehicle.\n\nThe view from the top is absolutely stunning — a panoramic sweep of the surrounding area that makes the climb worthwhile. What makes this spot even more special is the presence of not just the church, but also a mosque and a shrine nearby, all coexisting peacefully on the same hill. It adds a unique spiritual and cultural charm to the place.\n\nWhether you’re looking to spend some quiet time in reflection, take in the view, or just enjoy a peaceful walk, Rose Hill Church is a great spot to unwind. Highly recommended for a relaxing outing."

The signboard outside gives a brief history of the place as well. Easily can covered in half an hour as the place is not very big."

Absolute peace and bliss!\n\nThe ghat road leading to the monastery site (atop a hill) is well maintained but has a small entry charge at the main gate. There’s some space to park vehicles up the hill, just beside the monument site.\n\nThe cluster of monuments has been very well maintained by the Archaeology Department. The plaque at the entry informs that the Indian Navy spotted this site in the 1970s while on the lookout for a suitable naval base, and its discovery has improved the understanding of Buddhism in the Eastern Ghats region. There weren’t any guides, although the security personnel offered some information.\n\nThe site is pretty self-explanatory for those familiar with history and Buddhism, but I would love to see some more curated digital media guides that could help other tourists."

In CMR Central Gajuwaka entry receipt, 1st line is \" SECURITY SERVICE FREE\" and the last line \" WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY VALUABLE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF YOUR VEHICLE\".\n2. So the question is what type of free security service provided by CMR. After taking Rs 20 the organisation can't take responsibility of vehicle.\n3. In the paid security receipt only GST no mentioned but there is no information about actual service cost and GST %.\n4. In this mall Trends have no power backup for billing counter, 30 min waiting time on 11 sep 25 evening time.\n5 Arrange minimum 3lift from parking area to ground floor."

The place felt very congested, with narrow walkways and limited open space, making it uncomfortable during peak hours. There are not many branded outlets available, When compared to CMR Central in Maddilapalem, this mall clearly lacks both standards and variety. Maddilapalem’s mall feels more spacious, better organized, and offers a much wider range of branded outlets. It's surprising to see such a huge difference between two malls run by the same group."

If you guys have to throw away the sheets and models, just return to the students.\nIt's hard earned and built, you just kept the high price and made education a business. They'll have a good memory of their education if you return their belongings to them. I feel pity for all the students who graduated from GITAM."

Despite the older structure, the theatre maintains a classic movie-watching experience.\n- **Seating**: The seats are generally comfortable, though some areas could use refurbishment.\n- **Sound and Screen**: It has a decent screen size and good sound quality. It has kept up with some modern audio technologies.\n- **Ticket Pricing**: The ticket prices are quite reasonable compared to multiplexes, making it an affordable choice.\n\n### Cons:\n- **Parking**: Parking can be a challenge, especially during peak hours or when there’s a popular movie release.\n\nIn summary, Jagadamba Theatre is ideal for those who enjoy a traditional cinema-going experience at a reasonable price."

One of the best thing is the quick response we get when we stuck at a certain point be it cost effective interiors and planning, customer approach, constructive explanation on the designs provided etc..,\n\nSince this is an emerging company , people are unaware of its quality and if you are reading this consider yourself lucky and go for it.\n\nYes there are some well known companies in this field too ,but trust me this saves a hell lot of money & time. You need to have a  call with this company before you choose your decision ,only then you know the difference between money eating so called white collar brand companies and the newly emerging honest quality company like this.\n\nI am not any paid reviewer ,just a customer who is writing his heart ,out of satisfaction with the cost efficiency and the designs provided.\n\nIf you are planning something to build anything, you have a call and can blindly go for it at your affordable prices."

The drive to the beach was a bit risky — winding roads and sharp turns made it quite the adventure — but totally worth it for the breathtaking view that awaited us.\nWe spent a relaxing two hours there, soaking in the natural beauty and sipping on some of the biggest and freshest coconuts we’ve ever had! 🥥☀️ The beach is clean, peaceful, and offers a perfect escape from the city buzz.\nHighly recommended for anyone looking to unwind with a scenic backdrop! Just be cautious on those roads. 😉"

Cleanliness is severely lacking, and the water quality is poor, making it an unappealing spot for visitors.\n\nSwimming is not allowed, as there are multiple warning signs citing dangerous depths, which further limits the recreational appeal of this place. Overall, it's one of the worst beach experiences I've had.\n\nI sincerely hope the local authorities take action to improve the condition of the beach—both in terms of cleanliness and safety—so it can become a more enjoyable destination in the future."

It turned out to be one of the most enjoyable and refreshing experiences of our trip. Known for its natural beauty and clean shoreline, Rushikonda Beach is truly a gem on the east coast.\n\nThe beach was lively yet peaceful, with golden sands and clear blue waters creating a stunning view. The gentle waves and cool breeze made it a perfect spot to relax and unwind. We spent a good amount of time walking along the shore, chatting, and soaking in the serene atmosphere.\n\nWhat made the experience even better was the scenic drive to the beach. Surrounded by lush greenery and coastal roads, the journey itself was quite beautiful. The beach is also a great place for water sports like jet skiing and surfing, which adds excitement for adventure lovers, though we mainly went there to enjoy the peaceful vibe.\n\nFood stalls near the beach served tasty local snacks, allowing us to enjoy a light meal while enjoying the sea view. The beach was clean and well-maintained, which made our visit even more pleasant.\n\nOverall, Rushikonda Beach is a must-visit destination in Vizag for anyone who loves nature, sea views, and a relaxed vibe. It was a memorable experience that I’d highly recommend to others. I would love to visit again someday."

The    sea current is usually gentle here, with a constant watch from the security, warning tourists venturing little inside the sea. A lot of families with kids and friends in groups make the most of this lovely sea coast playing in the serene beaches, enjoying the water rides, taking lovely photos, riding horses, and kids collecting sea shells.\nNote that Scuba diving is open only in winters between Sep through Jan. On the other days, one can enjoy speed boats and speed scooter rides.\nNote:\nThis beach does not have a facility  to shower. The facility that AP tourism provides is mostly non- functional; most of the time, there would be no water. So please make your own arrangements. The support staff at this facility are extremely arrogant and rude. Avoid this place.\nThere would be numerous photographers reaching out to you for snaps. Be very careful dealing with them.\nAlso, please be aware that the speed boat driver would usually ask for additional money to take you a little more inside the sea - don't encourage this. This is another trick to fool tourists and make more money."

It's incredibly accessible via public transport, making it easy for anyone to visit.\n\nBut what truly sets Rushikonda Beach apart is its vibrant atmosphere and abundance of amenities. The beach is lined with an incredible variety of food and snack stalls, catering to every taste and craving. From spicy street food to refreshing coconut water, you'll find it all here!\n\nThe beach itself is pristine and well-maintained, with plenty of space to soak up the sun, take a dip, or simply relax with family and friends. The scenic views of the surrounding landscape are simply breathtaking, especially during sunrise and sunset.\n\nI've visited many beaches in my life, but Rushikonda Beach stands out for its unique blend of natural beauty, convenience, and amenities. Whether you're a local or just visiting, this beach is an absolute must-visit. Five stars isn't enough – I'd give it ten stars if I could!\n\n*Pros:* Easily accessible, variety of food stalls, pristine beach, scenic views\n\n*Cons:* None!\n\n*Recommendation:* Visit Rushikonda Beach for a day of relaxation, fun, and sun. You won't regret it!\""

This stunning beach has stolen my heart with its pristine beauty, picturesque surroundings, and warm village hospitality.\n\nFirstly, the beach itself is incredibly clean and well-maintained. The sand is soft, the waters are calm, and the scenery is simply breathtaking. It's the perfect spot to relax, unwind, and soak up the sun.\n\nBut what truly sets Bheemili Beach apart is its stunning location within a beautiful village. The surrounding landscape is dotted with lush greenery, quaint cottages, and winding roads that seem to whisper stories of the past. It's a truly immersive experience that will leave you enchanted.\n\nAnd just when I thought it couldn't get any better, I discovered the newly opened Coco Arena! This incredible spot is surrounded by majestic coco trees that provide the most wonderful shade during the scorching summer months. It's the perfect spot to escape the heat and enjoy the cool ocean breeze.\n\nI've visited many beaches in my life, but Bheemili Beach stands out for its unique blend of natural beauty, village charm, and modern amenities. Whether you're a local or just visiting, this beach is an absolute must-visit. Five stars isn't enough – I'd give it ten stars if I could!\n\n*Pros:* Pristine beach, picturesque village surroundings, newly opened Coco Arena with coco trees providing shade\n\n*Cons:* None!\n\n*Recommendation:* Head to Bheemili Beach for a day of relaxation, exploration, and fun in the sun. Don't forget to visit the Coco Arena for a truly unforgettable experience!\""

We went there around 9 PM and ended up staying until 1:30 in the morning — that’s how beautiful and peaceful the place was. Time just flew by without us even realizing it.\n\nThe night view of the beach was simply fantastic. The sound of the sea waves, the cool breeze, and the reflection of the moon on the water created a magical atmosphere. It was a perfect night for relaxation and quality family time. There were many other families there too, enjoying the calm and safe environment.\n\nMy kids had a great time playing on the sand and watching the waves. The beach was lively but not too crowded, which made it even more enjoyable. One of the best things was that even at night, there were small stalls available for snacks, tea, and coffee — perfect for keeping warm and refreshed.\n\nOverall, it was a memorable night by the sea. RK Beach is definitely a must-visit spot in Vizag, especially if you want to spend peaceful, happy moments with your loved ones. We’re already planning to come back again soon!"

The port can also be seen on the right hand side. There are plenty hotels, restaurants, cafes and street food options. Perfect family weekend outing spot also. A must visit place."

The trees give it like you're actually in any tropical island kind of vibe. The beach side is well maintained with hygiene and has some sitting stuff. The place is also very photogenic where one can get a good picture with a dazzling sea view. I'd recommend this place for sure. 🏖️"

The gentle sound of waves, the soft golden sands, and the clean, well-maintained promenade make it the perfect place for a peaceful evening walk or a relaxing family outing. 🌅\nThe sunrise here is absolutely breathtaking – definitely worth waking up early for! There are plenty of local food stalls nearby where you can enjoy fresh snacks and chai while watching the ocean.\nLoved the overall vibe — calm, clean, and scenic. Whether you're a local or a tourist, RK Beach is a must-visit spot to unwind and soak in nature's beauty. 💙📍 Highly recommend visiting during early morning or sunset hours for the best experience."

We reached the beach early in the morning to enjoy the peaceful atmosphere and cool breeze. The sound of the waves and the sunrise created a beautiful and calming start to our day.\n\nHowever, one major downside was our experience with the local photographers on the beach. We were scammed by a few of them who overcharged us and delivered very poor-quality photos. Their behavior was rude and unprofessional. I strongly recommend that visitors avoid getting their pictures clicked by the beachside photographers, as most of them are not trustworthy and lack basic manners.\n\nAside from that, we had a great time. We walked along the beach, explored nearby streets, and took in the stunning coastal views. The area around the beach has a lively yet relaxed vibe. In the evening, we returned to the beach and sat by the shore, watching the waves and enjoying the cool breeze. The view during sunset was absolutely beautiful and added to the overall charm of the place.\n\nDespite the issue with the photographers, our visit to RK Beach was fun and enjoyable. It’s a great spot for both early morning and evening visits. The natural beauty of the beach is worth experiencing. Just be a bit cautious with the photographers, and you’ll have a great time."

However, the experience is often spoiled by scammers posing as photographers who deceive visitors and extract large sums of money. They usually operate in groups, surrounding their targets and even resorting to threats if their demands are not met.\n\nAt first, they persistently offer to take photos, claiming that each picture costs only ₹20. The seemingly reasonable price may make you agree, but this is where the trick begins. They proceed to take numerous photos without your consent and later display them at a rapid pace, allowing you to view each image only once. Once selected, you cannot go back and change your choices. Some photos may be barely visible, yet they are included in the count.\n\nUnknowingly, you might believe you’ve selected just 5-6 photos, but they claim you have chosen around 40-50. As a result, instead of paying ₹100-₹120 as planned, you are suddenly asked to pay ₹800-₹1000. If you refuse, they intimidate you and prevent you from leaving.\n\nVisitors should stay cautious of these scammers, and the Visakhapatnam Police and Administration must take action to ensure public safety and protect the reputation of this beautiful destination."

Earlier we need to walk along the beach from appikonda beach point to here. But A cement road had been laid to this view such that the people can take their two wheelers upto the view. This road go through the appikonda village.\nBut this view point is yet to be developed fully, so better to keep the vehicles near appikonda beach view point and walk along side beach to reach here\nThe main attraction of this beach is the hill and the temple over it. One has to cross the canal to reach the hill and to climb the hill to reach the temple.\nIt's worth to climb the hill to have a splendid  view of surrounding water ,hill, sunrise and sunset too But care had to be taken while crossing the canal as it will be skiddy and dirty. Also the water level will raise at evening time"

It's not just a museum – it feels like stepping into a preserved piece of living history.\n\nThe submarine itself is compact and impressive. As you move through the narrow corridors and peek into the control rooms, torpedo bays, and sleeping quarters, you can’t help but admire the bravery and discipline of the crew who once lived and worked here for months at a time.\nThe museum staff, many of whom are ex-navy personnel, do an excellent job explaining the submarine’s operations and sharing fascinating stories about life under the sea.\n\nFrom a technical, historical, and emotional perspective, the INS Kursura offers a deeply enriching experience. It’s also beautifully maintained, right by the beach, making it a perfect blend of education and a day out by the sea.\n\nTip: Visit in the evening for a cooler experience and enjoy the illuminated view of the submarine at night!"

They are all located in walkable distance near RK beach. Try to visit in the evening as it will be cool. There will be air conditioning throughout the tour, so no need to worry about ventilation.\nThere will be colourful lighting for submarine from the evening which will be a good view from opposite road."

The timings are restricted from 3PM - 5PM only, so plan accordingly.\n\nIt is located towards the south of vizag, roughly 25km from RK beach. The way goes through industrial areas, military areas and a steep ghat road. The ghat road journey can be a little tough with sharp turns, speed breakers, steep road and bumpy patches.\n\nOnce you reach the entrance, there is a good parking area and you can buy the entry ticket. From there you need to walk around 200-300m to the main lighthouse. From there you need to climb around 70 normal steps and 10-12 steps in a ladder to reach the top.\n\nThe view is just breathtaking and very wholesome. The wind will be strong, so take care of your belongings. And walk slowly as there is less area to roam on the top. Cellphone signals will be weak here."

It’s a great spot for photography, relaxation, or simply soaking in the refreshing sea breeze. The vantage point also gives visitors a unique perspective of Vizag’s natural beauty, blending hills, sea, and port views all in one frame. Do take note of the visiting time on the day of your visit. Its 3pm-5pm.\nSecurity is kind of strict in the area for obvious reasons.\n\nFor those exploring the city, the Dolphin’s Nose Lighthouse is a must-visit destination to experience the scenic grandeur of the coast"

              "reviewText": "Dolphin's Nose Lighthouse: A Vizag Gem with Room for Improvement (and a Few Quirks)\n\nDolphin's Nose Lighthouse offers an undeniably nice atmosphere with amazing views that are well worth the visit. Perched atop the iconic Dolphin's Nose hill, the panoramic vistas of the Bay of Bengal, the sprawling Vizag coastline, and the surrounding lush greenery are simply breathtaking. It's a fantastic spot to enjoy the sea breeze, capture stunning photographs, and simply soak in the natural beauty of the region.\nHowever, the experience does come with a few notable caveats. During my visit, the entry was open but the lighthouse itself was not accessible, and there was no explanation provided. This was quite disappointing, as the opportunity to explore the lighthouse interior and potentially ascend for an even higher vantage point is a significant draw. Clear signage or a staff member on hand to explain the closure would greatly enhance the visitor experience.\nThere is a nominal entry fee of ₹10 per person, which is quite reasonable for the views on offer. A practical point to note for future visitors is that only cash is accepted for entry fees. In an increasingly digital world, the lack of UPI or other e-commerce payment provisions feels outdated and inconvenient. Having to scramble for cash can detract from the initial excitement of arrival.\nAdditionally, should the lighthouse be open during your visit, be prepared to remove your shoes for entry. While this isn't a major inconvenience, it's good to be aware of beforehand, especially if you're wearing footwear that's difficult to slip on and off.\nDespite these minor frustrations and quirks, the sheer beauty of the location makes Dolphin's Nose Lighthouse a recommended stop in Vizag. If the operational aspects, particularly the consistent accessibility of the lighthouse and payment options, could be improved, it would undoubtedly elevate this already picturesque destination to a truly top-tier attraction."

We saw a wide variety of animals including tigers, white tigers, elephants, giraffes, crocodiles, snakes, lions, deer, and even an anaconda. The kids were especially excited to see the different species of birds, peacocks, and tortoises.\n\nWe chose to explore the entire zoo on foot, which allowed us to enjoy the natural beauty and greenery all around. It was a refreshing and peaceful walk, and a great way to connect with nature while learning about wildlife.\n\nWe also visited the butterfly zone, which looked nice, but unfortunately there were no butterflies at the time. That was a bit disappointing, but overall it didn’t take away from the experience.\n\nThe zoo is well-maintained and perfect for a family outing. My kids really enjoyed everything, and we had a great time together. Highly recommended for a fun and educational day out in nature"

The zoo is now home to a wide variety of animals, and the overall experience has been significantly upgraded.\n\nThe infrastructure is impressive, with beautifully maintained greenery throughout. There are plenty of benches and shaded areas under large trees, making it a very comfortable place to rest as you explore.\n\nDespite the hot weather outside, the zoo felt pleasantly cool thanks to the abundance of trees and plants, which really enhance the environment and provide a natural cooling effect.\n\nThe zoo also has free drinking water stations at multiple spots, which is a thoughtful and much-needed facility, especially during warmer months.\n\nThere’s a canteen inside the zoo too. I tried the chicken biryani, which was surprisingly tasty. They also serve meals, though I found those to be just average in taste.\n\nFor convenience, the zoo offers traveller vehicles and electric cycles, which are great for covering the large area without getting too tired.\n\nOverall, it’s a fantastic place to hang out with family or friends. Whether you're there for the animals, the peaceful greenery, or just a relaxing day out, this zoo has truly become a great destination. Highly recommended!\n\nThe best visit time is around 11 to 11:30 AM as it is the feeding time for the animals."

It’s a great learning experience, especially for kids.\n\n✅ Good Environment – The park is spacious, and walking around gives you a real jungle-like feel.\n\n⚠️ Suggestion for Improvement: In the parrot section, the birds are not clearly visible due to white glass panels. It would be better if they used mesh or transparent barriers instead, to allow better viewing while ensuring safety.\n\nOverall, a great outing spot with lots to see and learn. With a few small improvements, it can become one of the best zoological parks in the region!\n\nLet me know if you'd like this translated or shortened for social media posts!"

Spread out across a large area, it features a wide variety of animal exhibits that are both educational and engaging. The enclosures are generally spacious, allowing the animals to move freely and providing visitors with a closer-to-natural experience.\n\nOne of the main highlights of the zoo is undoubtedly the White Bengal Tigers. These majestic animals are a major attraction, and watching them up close is a memorable experience.\n\nVisitors can choose between driving through the zoo in their own car or opting for a personal buggy ride, which makes it convenient for families and those who prefer a guided, comfortable tour. To fully explore the zoo and its exhibits, it usually takes around 2–3 hours.\n\nAt the same time, certain sections of the zoo are undergoing upgrading and renovation works, which is a positive sign of continuous improvement. Once completed, these will further enhance the visitor experience and the welfare of the animals.\n\nOverall, Vizag Zoo strikes a fine balance between recreation and conservation, making it a great place for families, animal lovers, and tourists alike."

Nestled near the historical site of Thotlakonda, this beach is a perfect blend of natural beauty and geological wonder. The highlight of my visit was the stunning natural arch at Mangamaripeta. This geological formation, sculpted by the relentless action of waves over thousands of years, is a testament to the awe-inspiring power of nature.\n\nThe beach itself is serene and less crowded, making it an ideal spot for those looking to escape the hustle and bustle of city life. The sound of the waves crashing against the rocks, coupled with the gentle sea breeze, creates a calming atmosphere that's perfect for relaxation. The natural arch, with its unique structure, is a photographer’s delight and a must-visit for geology enthusiasts.\n\nWalking along the shoreline, I was captivated by the pristine beauty of the surroundings. The clear waters, golden sands, and lush greenery add to the scenic charm of Thotlakonda Beach. It’s not just a place to unwind but also a reminder of the incredible natural history of the region. I would highly recommend this beach to anyone visiting Visakhapatnam—it’s a place where nature and tranquility come together beautifully."

The beach, the stranded Bangladesh ship, and the sunrise created such a calming experience.\n\nIt’s a peaceful place to spend a quiet morning. I’m not sure if it gets crowded later in the day, especially with kids, but I had a great time there.\n\nI took the stairs down for a closer view of the stranded ship. There were quite a few photoshoots going on near the rocks, with the ship as a backdrop and the sunrise adding a natural effect. 😁 I also got to see some local fishermen pulling in their nets full of fish.\n\nOverall, it was a good experience, and I would definitely recommend anyone visiting Vizag to plan a morning visit here."

However, beware of scammers posing as photographers near the ship.\n\nThese individuals will offer to take your photo for a small fee (₹20 per photo), but it’s a trap. Even if you clearly say you want only 5 pictures, they will click hundreds, then claim they can’t delete any of the selected ones. You’ll be forced to pay for low-quality, poorly composed images taken on substandard cameras by people with zero photography skills.\n\nThey usually wait in a shed near the old ship, targeting unsuspecting tourists.\n\nAvoid them at all costs.

It’s not a full, detailed museum — but as an outdoor memorial, it does a good job of combining solemn remembrance with scenic waterfront ambiance, making it well-suited for short visits, personal reflection, or as part of a broader beach road walk.\n\nIf you’re traveling in Visakhapatnam, especially along Beach Road, the Victory at Sea Memorial is a worthy stop: not just for its historical resonance, but also for the peaceful, contemplative space it provides next to the sea. It pairs particularly well with visits to the Ramakrishna Beach and the INS Kurusura Submarine Museum, turning the walk into both a tour and a moment of remembering the naval heritage of the city."

It was an exciting and educational experience for our whole family. The museum is centered around the decommissioned TU 142M aircraft, a long-range maritime patrol and anti-submarine warfare aircraft used by the Indian Navy.\n\nThe aircraft, now on display, has been beautifully preserved. We were amazed by its massive size and advanced features for its time. Inside the museum, there are several informative exhibits about the aircraft’s history, its role in Indian defense, and the technology used. The children especially enjoyed the interactive screens and videos that explained how the aircraft operated.\n\nThe museum is well-maintained, with clean surroundings and helpful staff. We also appreciated the neatly arranged photo gallery and the short documentary that gave us more insights into naval aviation.\n\nOverall, it was a fun and educational outing for all of us. The visit gave us a sense of pride in our nation’s defense achievements. We highly recommend the TU 142 Museum to families visiting Vizag – it's a great combination of learning and enjoyment.👌👍🤝🤝🤝🥰"

              "reviewText": "In March, I had the pleasure of visiting the 142 Aircraft Museum in Visakhapatnam with a friend, and it turned out to be one of the most memorable experiences of our trip. Located right along the beautiful RK Beach and near the iconic INS Kurusura Submarine Museum, the aircraft museum offers a fascinating glimpse into Indian Naval aviation history.\n\nThe highlight of the museum is the HAL Tupolev Tu-142M aircraft, which served the Indian Navy for nearly three decades. Standing tall and majestic, the aircraft’s sheer size is impressive and commands attention. Inside the museum, we got to explore the aircraft's interior, including its cockpit, radar systems, and sonar room, all of which are preserved to reflect its operational condition. The exhibits and displays were informative and well-organized, with plenty of background on the aircraft’s missions, technology, and history.\n\nWhat made the visit even more exciting was the proximity to the submarine museum, offering a rare chance to explore both naval air and underwater defense technology at one location. The setting by the beach added to the charm, making it perfect for a relaxed yet educational outing.\n\nThe staff was helpful, and the entry process was smooth. I’d highly recommend the 142 Aircraft Museum to anyone visiting Vizag—whether you’re an aviation enthusiast, history buff, or just looking for a unique experience by the sea. It’s a tribute to India’s naval legacy and a proud piece of maritime history."

However, it's important to note that I did notice a faint chemical smell in the vicinity, which might be attributed to nearby industrial activities. While it's a minor drawback,\n\nOne charming aspect of this beach is the presence of colorful fishing boats, which not only add to the natural beauty but also provide an authentic glimpse into the local fishing community's life.\n\nI recommend visiting during daylight hours when the scenic beauty of the beach shines through, and the smell is less noticeable. Overall, it's a serene spot for a family outing that's not to be missed."

The highlight of the beach is the two massive rocks, approximately 50 meters high, which people often climb to enjoy the breathtaking view. It's an ideal location for photoshoots.\n\nThere’s also a nearby village where you can find basic essentials, making it a great spot for picnics and chilling out with friends. One fascinating thing about this beach is that one side has low tides while the other side experiences high tides, making it safe for families to enjoy the calmer side.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed my time here. The beautiful sunset was mesmerizing, and the surrounding hills added to the charm. However, the roads leading to the beach are narrow, so you need to drive carefully. Overall, it was an amazing experience, and I had a lot of fun!"

The surrounding little hillocks offer an amazing view of the beach and is also a good place to have a picnic with a bunch of friends.\nNot a very safe place for girls, so I'd suggest to return back before it gets dark.\nThere is slightly bigger hill that can be scaled in less than 30 minutes and that offers an unprecedented view of the village and the beach."
