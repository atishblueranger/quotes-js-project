The palace showcases stunning Rajput architecture, with intricate courtyards, balconies, and museums that take you back in time.\n\nI'd recommend visiting in the morning when it's less crowded and you can really soak in the beauty of the place. If you're a student, don't forget to carry your ID card - you'll get your entry ticket at half price, which is a big plus!\n\nSince the palace is massive, whether you take a guide depends on your preference. If you're short on time (around 1 hour), a guide will help you cover the main highlights quickly. But if you enjoy exploring at your own pace, I'd suggest skipping the guide and wandering freely - there's so much to discover.\n\nOne important tip: avoid parking your car at the City Palace parking lot. They charge around ₹350, which is quite steep. Instead, use the nearby government parking areas around the palace - much more economical.\n\nOverall, City Palace is not just a monument, but an experience of Udaipur's royal heritage. Definitely worth the visit!",

This palace is totally made for the sunset view. I visited here in march end week and I missed the sunset view from the karni mata mandir. But caught the full 🌇 sunset view at this palace.\n\nThe price can be feel bit high but truly worth it. Here, you can go by your own vehicle or by buying ticket for car service that will provide take and drop service.\n\nNote: If you took their vehicle service don't lost the ticket as the contact details are written on the ticket only. So , if you missed the last car while enjoying till bit late. So you can contact them and they will come to pick you. But try to come back till 6pm last after that you will not get auto or any online service as this place is far from local areas.",

            "text": "Beautiful Location, Especially During Monsoon But a Bit Overpriced..\n\nMonsoon Palace is located on a hill surrounded by lush greenery, offering breathtaking views especially during the monsoon season, when its natural beauty multiplies. The road leading to the top is about 4 km long, steep, and winding, making it more suitable for experienced drivers.\nAuto-rickshaws are not allowed, so visitors must either use their own vehicle or a government-approved cab. At the top, there's a small restaurant where you can enjoy coffee and snacks amidst scenic views and cool, refreshing winds.\nFrom the palace, you get a panoramic view of Udaipur city, which is truly mesmerizing and peaceful. The palace also features a small wildlife exhibit and an interactive projector where you can see yourself amidst wild animals-a fun experience, though nothing extraordinary.\nYou should plan to spend at least an hour exploring the place. However, I felt the entry ticket (₹174 per person) is a bit overpriced for what's offered. Also, personal car parking costs ₹338, which is quite expensive and should be reviewed by the authorities.\n\nOverall, the place is worth visiting for nature lovers and photographers, especially during the rainy season but be prepared for the high charges.",
