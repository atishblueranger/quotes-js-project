Over it, one had to ask for salt on the table, and water and I had to ask for a bit of onion as they just kept rajma and roti on the table and ran away.\nHowever, rooms are clean, ac works, person who gave water was nice. No wifi like most places in andamans. Network sucks in rooms. A cute looking dog roam around the place. Looks harmless but could not be liked by some guests who are not dog lovers.\nOne can stay here but have minimum expectations. As I said earlier location wud not disappoint you. A lotttt of trees and greens around. For food go out and take a left, walk few metres, on right is a south indian shack ( real shack 10₹ for idli per piece and 50₹ fr a decent masala dosa. If you walk further 500m then in market there is a much shop like restaurant as well. Sharing the bill with review."

              "reviewText": "Bambooflat Jetty is a crucial transport hub in Port Blair, providing seamless connectivity between the city and the Portblair. It is well-maintained and serves as an essential link for both locals and tourists traveling to places like Chatham, Hope Town, and Mount Harriet National Park.\n\nConnectivity & Accessibility:\n\nThe jetty is strategically located and easily accessible from the main city via road, with regular bus and auto-rickshaw services available. The approach road is well-paved, and there is sufficient space for parking near the jetty. However, during peak hours, congestion can be an issue due to high passenger inflow.\n\nAvailability of Ferries:\n\nFrequent government-operated ferries run between Bambooflat and Chatham Jetty, ensuring a smooth and economical mode of transport. The ferries operate at regular intervals, approximately every 30 minutes, making it a reliable choice for daily commuters and tourists. The ticketing process is hassle-free, with affordable fares and separate queues for pedestrians and vehicles. The ferry service is punctual, though slight delays may occur during bad weather or high tide.\n\nFacilities & Experience:\n\nThe jetty has basic waiting areas, though they can get crowded during peak hours. Vendors selling snacks and refreshments are available nearby. The scenic ferry ride offers beautiful views of the Andaman waters, making the journey enjoyable.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nBambooflat Jetty is a well-connected and efficiently managed transit point, playing a vital role in Andaman’s transport network. While infrastructure improvements like expanded waiting areas and better crowd management would enhance the experience, it remains a convenient and affordable mode of transport for exploring the region.\n\n⭐ Rating: 4/5"

Jeeps are available outside the Jetty to go up to the Mount Harriet. From the top the panoramic views of the North Bay Island and the Light House at a distance are enchanting.

When we visited, it was raining so there was no crowd 😅\n\nTalking about the museum, it is quite a  decent one with lots of information about tribes, andaman corals, fishes and navy, the main attraction being the whale skeleton at the display.\n\nLots of places to click pictures, have a shop at the end and a fun and informative place to be at. I guess you'll enjoy it when you visit this one. For your visit to andaman i would suggest planning your itinerary before,but but but, keep buffer days, you never know when you can get sea-sick. It is real broo!!!\n\nAnyways, it can be counted as a go-to spot in one of the days when you visit cellular Jail along with Ross and North Bay islands. So I'll give a 👍 for this one!"

Better to visit this prior to visiting other islands of Andaman so that you know what to expect when you explore the beautiful islands.\n\nThe museum is well-organized and offers a comprehensive overview of the islands' ecosystem. It has several sections displaying a variety of exhibits like corals, shells, and even a collection of rare fish and sea creatures."

It’s a great place to learn about the rich cultural heritage of the islands.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you're in Port Blair and want to explore the local history and indigenous cultures.

              "reviewText": "This museum turned out to be an unexpectedly good finding. It is small, compact, neatly organized and showcases the lives, social norms, economy and festivities of the tribal groups of Andaman and Nicobar islands. The exhibits are complimented with detailed descriptions, so one can walk through and gather a very clear picture. There are life sized replicas of huts and canoes along with exhibits of jewelry, clothing, hunting / gathering / defense weapons, musical and percussion instruments, household goods and utensils and such.\n\nA very informative and educational museum. Photography is not allowed through most of this venue though you can capture the canoes and hit replica outdoors."

Photography is not allowed and closed on Mondays. Has an elevator but the layout is too complicated. It’s not visitor friendly. Will recommend only if one has spare time in Port Blair."

              "reviewText": "If you are having free time 30 minutes while in Port Blair, just go to the Anthropological museum for a glimpse of Andman and Nicobar Islands people and their way of life.  Although I had so much expectations but for my dismay it was barely above average, all which are available is photos ( not updated), some equipment, weapons etc. one or two life size huts are there. Need more literature ( magzine, books, pictures) which can be bought, more artifacts and materials depicting tribals. The audio visual facility looks way too old and clarity is missing. Hope to see revival taking place soon. Museums are a very important place to explore and enrich our knowledge."

I used it for my journey from Sri Vijay Puram/Port Blair to Havelock (Swaraj Dweep) and onwards to Neil Island (Shaheed Dweep), and the experience was smooth, scenic, and well worth the price.\n\nWhat Makes Makruzz a Great Choice:\n\nAir-Conditioned Comfort:\nThe cabins are nicely air-conditioned, offering a comfortable environment even during the warm tropical weather. The seats are cushioned and well-maintained, making the journey relaxing.\n\nPremium Service:\nFrom ticketing to boarding, everything is organized and efficient. Staff are polite, announcements are clear, and the overall service feels upscale compared to standard transport options.\n\nScenic Views:\nLarge glass windows offer stunning ocean views throughout the journey. Watching the vast blue sea roll by while seated in a cool, quiet cabin is a treat in itself.\n\nPricing:\nThe cost is approximately ₹3000 per person (one-way) depending on the route and class chosen. While it’s on the higher side, the comfort, punctuality, and premium feel justify the expense.\n\nDestinations Covered:\nMakruzz operates across major tourist routes including:\n\nPort Blair/ Sri Vijay Puram to Havelock (Swaraj Dweep)\n\nHavelock to Neil Island (Shaheed Dweep)\n\nPort Blair  to Neil (Shaheed Dweep)\nFinal Thoughts:(Shaheed Dweep)\nIf you're planning island hopping in the Andamans and prefer a hassle-free, clean, and comfortable ride, Makruzz is a top-tier option. Ideal for families, couples, or solo travelers who value comfort and scenic travel.\n\nHighly recommended for those looking to make the journey as memorable as the destination."

Mobile network will be challenging here, north side of the Island only BSNL works well and when you go towards the Southern side of the Island it Airtel and Jio works well.\n2. Book your return ferry (Govt. Or Private) well in advance : For Govt. ferry pls go to STARZ and there are many private players in Andaman i.e. Nautica, MaKcruzz etc.\n3. Govt. Ferry is cheap, however there is no luxury in their boats, on the other hand private ferries are quite good and comfortable hence, quite expensive as well\n4. To reach from one corner to another corner of the Island you have very few options for travel/commuting. Autorickshaw takes a minimum of ₹200/- charge irrespective of distance and they only available near to the main Bharatpur Beach/ Jetty or Market area only. Better to note their contact details while you take the first ride with them and call to pick you from your hotel or any other place when needed. Otherwise cabs are also available but they charge a higher amount than the Autorickshaw.\n5. Water games are good in Elephant Island, Havelock and Neil Island.\n6. You can hire a two wheeler from Neil Island Market between ₹600 to ₹800 and escooty options are also available."

Just 7 km from the city, it’s easily reachable by cab or scooter, making it a tourist favorite. The beach offers thrilling activities like jet skiing and banana boat rides, with safety measures in place. Its shallow waters and lifeguards make it family-friendly. However, maintenance is disappointingly low, with litter occasionally dotting the shore and basic facilities like restrooms often neglected. Crowds swell during peak season (December-February), and food options at shacks are limited to basic snacks. Water sports may halt during high tides. For a serene visit, arrive early for stunning sunrises and fewer people. Carry sunscreen, as shade is scarce. Despite its accessibility and charm, the lack of upkeep slightly dims its appeal, but it remains a worthwhile half-day retreat."

I guess you'll enjoy it when you visit this one. For your visit to andaman i would suggest planning your itinerary before,but but but, keep buffer days, you never know when you can get sea-sick. It is real broo!!!\n\nAnyways, it can be counted as a go-to spot in one of the days when you visit cellular Jail along with Ross and North Bay islands. So I'll give a 👍 for this one!"

The staff are present on every floor and restrooms are available. The air-conditioning is a nice relief from the heat.\n\nReally enjoyed this museum. Certainly took me longer that 30 minutes to see it all especially if you want to watch the 3 documentaries. Very informative about the people of the Andamans and Nicobar Islands. All displays in English and Hindi."

There was no ac in the museum. So, in the scorching summer, you can experience sweating. Ticket price for Indians was 20 rupees per head. No photography was allowed inside of the museum."

It is small, compact, neatly organized and showcases the lives, social norms, economy and festivities of the tribal groups of Andaman and Nicobar islands. The exhibits are complimented with detailed descriptions, so one can walk through and gather a very clear picture. There are life sized replicas of huts and canoes along with exhibits of jewelry, clothing, hunting / gathering / defense weapons, musical and percussion instruments, household goods and utensils and such.\n\nA very informative and educational museum. Photography is not allowed through most of this venue though you can capture the canoes and hit replica outdoors."

Photography is not allowed and closed on Mondays. Has an elevator but the layout is too complicated. It’s not visitor friendly. Will recommend only if one has spare time in Port Blair."

Although I had so much expectations but for my dismay it was barely above average, all which are available is photos ( not updated), some equipment, weapons etc. one or two life size huts are there. Need more literature ( magzine, books, pictures) which can be bought, more artifacts and materials depicting tribals. The audio visual facility looks way too old and clarity is missing. Hope to see revival taking place soon. Museums are a very important place to explore and enrich our knowledge."

Underwater activities did not seem clean, hence. We chose not to go ahead with it. (we might be wrong), however we did some shopping, looked at the view, ate some Maggi and returned in an hour. Chill place, you can consider this for a half day trip. The boats will bring you to this island, there is obviously no direct road or any other way - 45 mins boat ride (motion sickness folks, beware!)"

Various private jetties offer package tours to this island, as well as to North Bay Island, which is primarily focused on water activities and can be skipped if you plan to do similar activities elsewhere.\n\nNotable places to visit include the Japanese Bunker (near the jetty), the Presbyterian Church, water distillation units, a swimming pool, and the powerhouse. All attractions are within walking distance, and for those who prefer not to walk, there are small electric cabs available, often with a tour guide.\n\nWe booked the light and sound show through the DSS Andaman online website for ₹300 per person. The show starts at 5:40 PM, but the boat to the show departs from Port Blair port at 4 PM. Note that the light and sound show tickets do not include boat tickets. You can purchase boat tickets from Phoenix Jetty, which opens at 3 PM on the same day (though the website mentioned Aberdeen Jetty, the DSS helpline directed us to Phoenix Jetty, so it's best to confirm beforehand. The helpline is very helpful).\n\nWhile the light and sound show is not of high quality, it offers a brief 40-minute explanation of Andaman's history in the beautiful voice of Gulzar Sahab, which history enthusiasts may appreciate. There are shows in both Hindi and English, but not on the same day."

Ross Island is a fantastic destination, just a quick 15 to 20-minute boat ride from Port Blair in ferry or speed boat. There they give you 1.5 hours for sightseeing after finishing the time you have to return with same ferry to reach north bay island so calculate the time & enjoy the view.\nThe island it used to be 200 acres & now it's just 70 acres left due to tsunami attack on the year 2004. Because of this island is being there some other places have been saved from tsunami in Andaman and Nicobar island. There are two options for sightseeing in the island. Either you can walk & enjoy the beauty of the island (or) you can take the ride which is Rs. 100/-per head  in battery vehicle. Beware while walking because there sometimes the coconuts will fall from the tree.\nOld architecture buildings & church. It was once a British colony but is now maintained by the Indian Navy. British had made it the administrative capital of Andaman. Here we can see how British occupied this island though their buildings. Then how Japan made bunkers during world war. The Japanese Bunker (near the jetty), the Presbyterian Church, water distillation units, & the power house are really amazing.  But the church has been ruined by tsunami.\nYou can book the light & sound show through the DSS Andaman online website. The show tickets do not include boat tickets you have to purchase them separately. While the  show is not of high quality, it offers a brief 40-minute explanation of Andaman's history in the beautiful voice of Gulzar Sahab, which history enthusiasts may appreciate. There are shows in both Hindi and English, but not on the same day. Please check your language & book the tickets accordingly. The light & sound show is not allowed to photos & Videos .\nThis island is famous for a large deer & peacock and have become very friendly with the humans. Please don't feed the animals.\nDon't forget to meet the boss lady of the island Anuradha mam who is seeing after the island for more years. The most photogenic location. Worth visiting."

You can explore the entire island in about 2 to 3 hours, making it a perfect short getaway. The island is filled with historic ruins, which are a major tourist attraction. You’ll see many peacocks and deer roaming around, adding to the charm of the place. The ruins of British colonial buildings and the church at the top are especially fascinating.\n\nBe careful of falling coconuts as you walk around.\n\nIf you're visiting Andaman, Ross Island is a must-see for its beauty, wildlife, and history."

They will give you 1 -1.30 hrs to spend there.\nThis is ruined island with history associated. There are battery operated cars which will take you to top.\nThere is light house and beach view - both are beautiful. But to go to light house there are many steps so old age people will not be able to get there, plan accordingly.\nThere are many deer.

Centrally located and easily accessible, this open-space haven is one of my absolute favorite spots to relax, breathe, and just be.\n\n🛫 Panoramic Views – A Treat for the Eyes\nWhat sets Joggers Park apart is its 360° scenic beauty. On one side, you get a front-row view of the nearby airport, where flights take off and land gracefully—almost like a live painting in motion. On the other, open skies stretch endlessly, creating a mesmerizing backdrop especially during sunrise and sunset. The hues of the sky—pinks, oranges, purples—are simply breathtaking. If you’re into photography, or just love watching the sky shift shades, this is your spot. 📸🌄\n\n👟 Perfect for Fitness & Leisure\nWhether you're into morning runs, evening walks, yoga, or just some me-time, the park offers plenty of space. The track is well-maintained, and there’s enough open area to stretch out or do group workouts. It’s also ideal for seniors and families with kids looking to enjoy a safe, open space.\n\n🍃 Atmosphere & Amenities\nThe cool breeze, especially during early mornings and post-sunset hours, makes it a refreshing retreat. While there’s no cover for rain (so best avoided on a rainy day), the wide openness is exactly what makes it so calming.\n\n🚗 Parking & Refreshments\nPlenty of free parking is available, so driving here is hassle-free. Right near the entrance, you’ll find a few snack stalls selling tea, coffee, biscuits, and light refreshments. Nothing fancy, but perfect for a quick sip and chat after a jog. ☕\n\n💡 Evening Vibes & Lighting\nCome evening, the park lights up beautifully—soft lighting along the path creates a calm, almost magical vibe. Whether you’re coming solo, with friends, or just for a pause between a hectic day—Joggers Park has that effortless charm.\n\n🚯 A Gentle Reminder\nThis place is naturally beautiful—let’s all keep it that way. Please don’t litter, and help maintain the calm, clean vibe that makes this park so special. 💚\n\n🏁 Final Thoughts\nJoggers Park is more than just a park—it's a slice of peaceful life tucked right in the city’s center. From plane-spotting to peaceful walks, golden hour selfies to quiet contemplation—this place has something for everyone.\n\nHighly recommended for fitness lovers, nature seekers, and anyone who enjoys the small, beautiful things in life."

It's a must-visit for anyone interested in the Andaman Islands' rich colonial past and abundant wildlife.\n\nThis is what you must visit in Ross Island. These islands will definitely give you something more than others, from friendly deer, old British construction, a church, and a lighthouse.\nBuilt between 1942 and 1945, the Japanese Bunkers were constructed when the Japanese army invaded these islands strategically for the purpose of defeating the Allied powers that included Britain, France, Russia, and the US. Japan was part of the Axis powers that comprised Italy and Germany."

Nestled amidst lush greenery and ancient ruins, these bunkers stand as silent witnesses to a turbulent chapter of history—the Japanese occupation of the Andaman Islands during World War II.\n\nHistorical Significance:\n\nDuring the Second World War (1942-1945), the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were occupied by the Imperial Japanese Army, marking one of the few times that Indian soil was directly controlled by foreign forces other than the British. The Japanese fortified the island by building underground bunkers and pillboxes to protect against potential Allied attacks. These bunkers, constructed with reinforced concrete, were used for defense, surveillance, and artillery placements.\n\nStanding in front of these bunkers, one can’t help but feel the weight of history. The thick walls, narrow openings for gun barrels, and the strategic positioning overlooking the sea tell stories of war, occupation, and the global conflict that once reached these distant shores.\n\nThe Experience:\n\nExploring the Japanese bunkers is both visually striking and emotionally stirring. The weathered structures, now partially reclaimed by nature, create a haunting yet beautiful sight. The calm and peaceful surroundings of the island today stand in stark contrast to the tense wartime history the bunkers represent.\n\nThe bunkers are easily accessible as you stroll around the island, making them an integral part of the NSCB Island heritage walk. My family and I found ourselves imagining the soldiers who once stood guard here, looking out over the sea, unaware of what the future would bring.\n\nThe preserved state of the bunkers, combined with informative plaques and guided tours (if available), helps visitors connect with the island’s layered past—not just as a British colonial seat but also as a WWII battlefield.\n\nTips for Visitors:\n\nWear comfortable shoes as you’ll be walking around the island to visit the bunkers and other attractions.\n\nCombine the visit with the NSCB Lighthouse and the Light & Sound Show for a complete historical experience.\n\nEarly mornings or late afternoons are the best times for visiting, as the weather is cooler and the lighting is great for photography.\n\nOverall Impression:\n\nThe Japanese Bunkers on NSCB Island are an essential stop for anyone interested in history, architecture, or wartime heritage. They offer a quiet yet powerful glimpse into a period when the Andaman Islands found themselves at the crossroads of global conflict. Visiting these bunkers left me with a deeper appreciation for the island’s complex past and the resilience of its people.\n\nFor history lovers and curious travelers alike, this site deserves a 5-star rating for its preservation, significance, and the reflective atmosphere it provides."

Knowing that this is where Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose hoisted the Indian flag in 1943, long before independence, gives the place a deep, moving significance. It’s not just history - it’s a feeling.\n\nThe memorial sits along a spacious seaside promenade, with the sound of waves on one side and a clear view of Ross Island on the other. It’s a lovely spot for a relaxed walk or simply sitting and watching the sea. There are a few snack stalls and vendors around, and the atmosphere is calm - not overly crowded, especially if you come during quieter hours.\n\nThere’s no entry fee, and plenty of parking for scooters and bikes, which makes it easy to access.\n\nFor me, it was a mix of patriotism and peace - to be in the same place where a powerful chapter of India’s freedom struggle was written, while surrounded by the beauty of the Andaman coast. A visit here is not just recommended - it’s essential."

The silent walls and corridors of Kalapani have witnessed the horrors of torture and the spirit of resistance and still stand, bleak and empty as ever. Built to give the guards an all-around view of the inmates, you can now catch amazing views from the top of the watchtowers.",

The historic significance of this place is immense — it stands as a powerful reminder of the sacrifices made by countless freedom fighters during India’s struggle for independence. The architecture of the jail itself is stark and haunting, yet beautifully preserved. The light and sound show in the evening was especially moving, narrating the stories of bravery and resilience in a gripping and emotional manner. The museum and galleries offer detailed insights and well-curated exhibits. This is a must-visit for anyone traveling to the Andaman Islands — not just for its historical value, but for the deep sense of patriotism it evokes. Truly unforgettable!"

The historical significance of the site, especially in India's struggle for independence, is deeply impactful. Walking through the corridors and cells gives you a real sense of the hardships faced by the freedom fighters imprisoned here. The architecture though stark, tells its own story of isolation and resilience.\nThe light and sound show in the evening is definitely a highlight—it's well narrated and adds emotional depth to the history, bringing the stories of the past to life. The museum sections are informative, though they could be better maintained and updated with clearer signage and more engaging displays.\nIt can get a bit crowded during peak tourist seasons, and some parts of the jail are not easily accessible for elderly visitors. However, overall, it's a must-visit for anyone interested in India's history and heritage. A somber, yet inspiring place."

The island holds historical significance as its scenic view is featured on the back of the old ₹20 red-colored note, making it even more special to visit.\n\nThis island is a paradise for adventure lovers, offering a variety of water activities such as scuba diving, sea walking, submarine rides, and glass-bottom boat rides. The highlight of the experience is the mesmerizing coral reefs, which are not only beautiful but also ecologically significant.\n\nMy family and I had an amazing time exploring the underwater world and enjoying the serene surroundings. The best time to visit North Bay Island is between November and February when the weather is pleasant, making the experience even more enjoyable. A must-visit spot for nature and adventure enthusiasts!"

Underwater activities did not seem clean, hence. We chose not to go ahead with it. (we might be wrong), however we did some shopping, looked at the view, ate some Maggi and returned in an hour. Chill place, you can consider this for a half day trip. The boats will bring you to this island, there is obviously no direct road or any other way - 45 mins boat ride (motion sickness folks, beware!)"

Just 7 km from the city, it’s easily reachable by cab or scooter, making it a tourist favorite. The beach offers thrilling activities like jet skiing and banana boat rides, with safety measures in place. Its shallow waters and lifeguards make it family-friendly. However, maintenance is disappointingly low, with litter occasionally dotting the shore and basic facilities like restrooms often neglected. Crowds swell during peak season (December-February), and food options at shacks are limited to basic snacks. Water sports may halt during high tides. For a serene visit, arrive early for stunning sunrises and fewer people. Carry sunscreen, as shade is scarce. Despite its accessibility and charm, the lack of upkeep slightly dims its appeal, but it remains a worthwhile half-day retreat."

The waters shimmer in shades of blue and green, especially around sunset, making it a delightful spot for photography.\n\nTips:\n•\tIdeal for a quick beach visit if you’re in Port Blair.\n•\tGreat for water sports, but not the best for swimming due to uneven seabed.\n•\tSunset views here are magical—plan to reach by evening."

When we visited, it was raining so there was no crowd 😅\n\nTalking about the museum, it is quite a  decent one with lots of information about tribes, andaman corals, fishes and navy, the main attraction being the whale skeleton at the display.\n\nLots of places to click pictures, have a shop at the end and a fun and informative place to be at. I guess you'll enjoy it when you visit this one. For your visit to andaman i would suggest planning your itinerary before,but but but, keep buffer days, you never know when you can get sea-sick. It is real broo!!!\n\nAnyways, it can be counted as a go-to spot in one of the days when you visit cellular Jail along with Ross and North Bay islands. So I'll give a 👍 for this one!"

The museum provides a fascinating glimpse into the diverse cultures and tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The exhibits are well-curated, showcasing traditional attire, tools, and artifacts of the indigenous tribes, with detailed descriptions of their lifestyles and history.\n\nOne of the highlights is the documentary showcasing the complete lifestyle of the tribes, which is shown in a dedicated video room – a great addition to the overall experience.\n\nWhile the museum is relatively small, it is packed with informative displays, making it an excellent stop for anyone interested in anthropology or the region’s history. It’s a great place to learn about the rich cultural heritage of the islands.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit if you're in Port Blair and want to explore the local history and indigenous cultures. You’ll only need about 30 minutes before heading to the airport, making it a convenient stop!"

The entrance fee is Rs.20 for each adult and Rs.10 for child below 12 years While there is a photo/video ban, it seems to be largely ignored based on online reviews. The staff are present on every floor and restrooms are available. The air-conditioning is a nice relief from the heat.\n\nReally enjoyed this museum. Certainly took me longer that 30 minutes to see it all especially if you want to watch the 3 documentaries. Very informative about the people of the Andamans and Nicobar Islands. All displays in English and Hindi."

It is small, compact, neatly organized and showcases the lives, social norms, economy and festivities of the tribal groups of Andaman and Nicobar islands. The exhibits are complimented with detailed descriptions, so one can walk through and gather a very clear picture. There are life sized replicas of huts and canoes along with exhibits of jewelry, clothing, hunting / gathering / defense weapons, musical and percussion instruments, household goods and utensils and such.\n\nA very informative and educational museum. Photography is not allowed through most of this venue though you can capture the canoes and hit replica outdoors."

Although I had so much expectations but for my dismay it was barely above average, all which are available is photos ( not updated), some equipment, weapons etc. one or two life size huts are there. Need more literature ( magzine, books, pictures) which can be bought, more artifacts and materials depicting tribals. The audio visual facility looks way too old and clarity is missing. Hope to see revival taking place soon. Museums are a very important place to explore and enrich our knowledge."

Centrally located and easily accessible, this open-space haven is one of my absolute favorite spots to relax, breathe, and just be.\n\n🛫 Panoramic Views – A Treat for the Eyes\nWhat sets Joggers Park apart is its 360° scenic beauty. On one side, you get a front-row view of the nearby airport, where flights take off and land gracefully—almost like a live painting in motion. On the other, open skies stretch endlessly, creating a mesmerizing backdrop especially during sunrise and sunset. The hues of the sky—pinks, oranges, purples—are simply breathtaking. If you’re into photography, or just love watching the sky shift shades, this is your spot. 📸🌄\n\n👟 Perfect for Fitness & Leisure\nWhether you're into morning runs, evening walks, yoga, or just some me-time, the park offers plenty of space. The track is well-maintained, and there’s enough open area to stretch out or do group workouts. It’s also ideal for seniors and families with kids looking to enjoy a safe, open space.\n\n🍃 Atmosphere & Amenities\nThe cool breeze, especially during early mornings and post-sunset hours, makes it a refreshing retreat. While there’s no cover for rain (so best avoided on a rainy day), the wide openness is exactly what makes it so calming.\n\n🚗 Parking & Refreshments\nPlenty of free parking is available, so driving here is hassle-free. Right near the entrance, you’ll find a few snack stalls selling tea, coffee, biscuits, and light refreshments. Nothing fancy, but perfect for a quick sip and chat after a jog. ☕\n\n💡 Evening Vibes & Lighting\nCome evening, the park lights up beautifully—soft lighting along the path creates a calm, almost magical vibe. Whether you’re coming solo, with friends, or just for a pause between a hectic day—Joggers Park has that effortless charm.\n\n🚯 A Gentle Reminder\nThis place is naturally beautiful—let’s all keep it that way. Please don’t litter, and help maintain the calm, clean vibe that makes this park so special. 💚\n\n🏁 Final Thoughts\nJoggers Park is more than just a park—it's a slice of peaceful life tucked right in the city’s center. From plane-spotting to peaceful walks, golden hour selfies to quiet contemplation—this place has something for everyone.\n\nHighly recommended for fitness lovers, nature seekers, and anyone who enjoys the small, beautiful things in life."

Was able to navigate without any hassle.\n\nI will add review about government ferries also here if anyone is looking for an opinion on it. I tried both private and government ferries, personally I absolutely loved the Government ones as most of the travellers were natives, it was slightly less crowded in viewing dock. We could enjoy the ride peacefully. The staffs were also friendly and courteous.\n\nA small hack is, don't take the premium Chair tickets on government ferry, as they are on lower deck with no view to the ocean. Also if you are a tourist there is a good chance that you are going to spend almost all time watching it from the viewing deck, so go for the Seat tickets as they are cheaper and have view of ocean which you can see even by sitting inside.\n\nWould definitely prefer government ferries if I am coming again."

It’s a private museum which is run by a gentleman who has a lot of knowledge of the islands. Photography of the artifacts is prohibited. He explains in detail about the islands and it’s history. Usually in Hindi which is sort of like the local language, but he does the explanation in a combination of Hindi and English on request. It should be on your list of places to go to. They charge 250 per head (as far as I remember...) and it’s a good idea to give them a call before you head out there. Not crowded."

The show ticket, you will get the inside of the centre. The show is nice and the duration is 15 minutes. When the seat full, they start the show. So no need to worry for that show. Apart from this, u will see many science projects in this centre. Nearest point to this centre is Flag Point. U must see this place. Overall a good experience."

Its beautiful small movie about turtle's life(for us) not sure if they have more varients too.\n3d view was quite realistic, just to note that it was an animation clip for us.\nHope u guys like it. Quick visit of worth for both nature and science tech adventure.\nAdded some outside clicks of beautiful place."

Every minute demand was given top consideration by the entire crew as soon as we arrived.  The main course was excellent, and they served a variety of appetisers.  Our hearts were won over by Mr. Vivek's amiable demeanour and kindness. He took several pictures of special moments together. As handling children sometimes becomes challenging here, they also did a great job with our children without any difficulty. The host's ability to attend to all of your needs and answer any questions is what counts. This will create a favourable impression that lasts forever. The ambience and the night view is something you should never miss. I would love to come here again. 😊👍."

Tucked deep within the tranquil embrace of Reserve Forest, this resort is not just a place to stay—it’s an experience to feel.\n\nFrom the moment you arrive, you're surrounded by untouched greenery, the sounds of birds, rustling leaves, and pure mountain air. It's nature in its rawest, most beautiful form. 🌲🍃\n\nWhat makes this place truly special is the people behind it—the Bath brothers, Karan and Aman. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing them personally, and their genuine hospitality, warm nature, and hands-on involvement with every guest make a noticeable difference. They’re always around to help, guide, and make sure your stay is smooth and memorable.\n\n🏡 The Property\nThe resort is modest yet charming, with a rustic, earthy feel that perfectly complements its surroundings. The rooms are clean and cozy—ideal for couples, families, or solo nature seekers. Don’t expect ultra-luxury here; instead, come ready to disconnect and recharge in a place that thrives on simplicity and serenity.\n\n🍽️ Food & Amenities\nThe food is available here. There’s a pool table for casual evenings and several scenic spots around. The view from the property is straight out of a postcard—rolling hills, dense greens, and a sky full of stars at night. ✨\n\n👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Staff & Service\nThe staff (Anup) is incredibly polite, attentive, and helpful. You won’t find formal uniformed service here, but what you’ll get instead is heartfelt hospitality that’s warm and real.\n\n📍 Things to Keep in Mind\nYes, it’s a bit isolated. And yes, some facilities like network coverage (BSNL and Jio work better), ATMs, or convenience stores are limited. But that’s exactly what makes this place unique. It forces you to unplug, slow down, and connect—with nature, with people, and with yourself.\n\nNearby- you can visit Chota balu and Bada balu beach. Beautiful beaches located in the vicinity. Also Mindapahad trek and scenic beach, biological park, Scuba Diving can be done. Best place for early morning birding as well. They can arrange few activities as well such as star gazing, birding, SCUBA diving, boat rides, fishing etc.\n\n🌄 Final Thoughts\nWild Grass Resort isn’t for everyone—but for the right traveler, it’s everything. Whether you're a nature lover, a writer seeking inspiration, or just someone who wants to experience the calm that only a forest can offer—this place has its own magic.\n\nI totally loved it, and I’m sure I’ll be back again. Highly recommended for anyone looking to experience nature in its most authentic form. 🌿💚"

Our room was spacious with very comfortable beds and a lovely terrace to enjoy birdwatching. The food in the restaurant is amazing and the staff is super friendly, helpful and professional! During our stay we did some great diving with Lacadives who picked us up and dropped us of from our accommodation and also walked to some nearby beaches including the popular Munda Pahar beach and viewpoint. Highly recommend spending some time here!!"

They proactively stayed in touch inspite of poor mobile network in Andaman, speed corrected a couple minor hitches when came up (practicalities), proactively set right expectations & fed us pointers on how to best enjoy the places & activities.  They were resourceful to provide suitable options and quickly make nice arrangements when we probed for activities beyond typical itineraries. Most people they connected us to - from chauffeurs to scuba & bird-watching guides - were well-mannered and good at their job. ... Basically, all that I look for from a holiday company. Keep it up Dzire Andaman!"

Tucked away about 25 km from Port Blair, this beach is a perfect day trip destination that balances nature’s calm with raw beauty — ideal for friends, photographers, sunset chasers, or anyone craving peace by the sea.\n\n🧡 Sunset Lovers, Rejoice!\nThe sunset at Wandoor is nothing short of magical.

Reach by 3:30–4 PM, explore the area, click some pictures, and then settle in for the golden hour. It closes around 6:00–6:30 PM, so time your visit accordingly.\n\n✅ Quick Tips:\n\nNo water sports here — it's more of a relaxation beach.\n\nThere’s a jetty nearby for boats to Jolly Buoy Island (if open).\n\nParking available\n\nDon't swim here.\n\n⭐ Final Verdict:\nWandoor Beach isn’t just a place — it’s a mood.

Perfect for just sitting, chilling, and enjoying the view. We even brought some snacks and had a small celebration right by the shore 🧁🎂.\n\nThe sunset view here is absolutely beautiful 🌅 — peaceful vibes all around.
