The views are absolutely stunning 💯 all inclusive with the innsbrook pass which is the way to go. Only one downside. When you get to one of the huts at the top the toilets have no water so you can't flush them and one of the stewards was quite rude. Other than that was a fantastic half day experience.",

By the way, it gets extremely cold when the sun's gone even during hot summer days. So, don't forget to bring warm clothes in your backpack if you're planning to stay there longer. FYI: each year there's an event called #bergsonnwend in which they celebrate the longest day (normally it's June 21) on Saturday earlier or afterwards and everybody ignites a bonfire on the top of the mountains. On that day the lastest cable car back to the station of Patscherkofel is at 23.00 pm, so don't be late!",

There were no other passengers at the bag drop counters or security so we got through both in about 5 minutes. I would recommend looking at how many flights are leaving the airport around your flight time because if you're the only flight for a few hours then it will be a very fast process! The airport has beautiful views of the mountains but there's only one small duty free store and one small cafe. So you don't really need to get here 2 hours early if there aren't other flights at the same time :)",

Luckily it was not raining.  Once in, we were eventually checked in with boarding passed that stated that our flight was late by one hour. We had a quick lunch upstairs, only to realise that perhaps our flight was still trying to depart more or less in time.\n\nSo we hurried to security check, but the staff guided us go upstairs, it would be faster. We went there, but after standing a few minutes in very very slow queue there, we realised that the lines are moving faster downstairs after all. So back down!\n\nFortunately the other passengers were really friendly and let us jump the queue.  We made it thru relatively fast and found that, yes indeed, the gate was already open and the flight was indeed boarding.  So luckily we made it in the end, leaving about 20mins late. Definitely it was one of the most confusing on-boarding experiences for a long time.\n\nLESSON LEARNED - Dont trust what you see on your Boarding Card!",

            "text": "Innsbruck Airport is one of those rare airports where the journey feels special from start to finish. Small, efficient, and surrounded by breathtaking Alpine scenery, it's a gateway that already feels like part of the trip.\n\nThe terminal is compact, which makes navigation easy and stress-free. From check-in to security usually takes only a few minutes, far quicker than at major hubs. Staff are friendly and professional, and baggage handling is smooth-even with skis and snowboards during the busy winter season. While queues can get longer at peak holiday times, the atmosphere is still more relaxed than most airports.\n\nFacilities inside are modest but practical. You'll find cafés, a snack bar, duty-free shopping, and regional souvenirs. Don't expect endless dining or luxury lounges, but for a short wait before boarding, everything essential is there. Free Wi-Fi works reliably, which is always a plus.\n\nThe real highlight is the flight experience. Approaching or departing Innsbruck is unforgettable, with planes threading through dramatic mountain peaks and valleys. It's considered one of the most scenic-and challenging-landings in Europe, and pilots are specially trained for these alpine conditions. Winter weather can sometimes cause delays or diversions, but staff usually handle these situations well with clear communication.\n\nGetting to and from the airport is very convenient. The city center is only 15 minutes away by taxi, bus, or rental car. Public transport is reliable and affordable, and car rentals are right at the terminal for those heading to ski resorts or exploring Tyrol.\n\nOverall, Innsbruck Airport is efficient, welcoming, and uniquely beautiful. It may not have the scale of bigger airports, but as a smooth gateway to the Alps, it delivers an experience few others can match.",
