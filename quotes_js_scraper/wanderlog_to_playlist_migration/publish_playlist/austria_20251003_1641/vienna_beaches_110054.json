We tried to research for concrete details on this, however, there’s only conflicting info to be found online and from those we spoke to at the city’s transport crowd. This is the only so-called Strandbad (beach swimming pool) requiring an entry fee that we’ve included in this list, and there’s a damn good reason for this – because this ol’ favourite is as much a Viennese experience as is waltzing while wearing a Mozart wig, eating a Manner schnitte, and drinking a Spritzer – at the same time.",

The other side is the river, where u can also stay and have a swim, all of the places are watched by lifeguards. There's a shop where u can buy all the swimming things and rent some rackets to play tennis (3€ for 1h). The sun loungers are free and u can put them wherever you need, something AMAZING.\nThe restaurant/bar it's really comfortable and the prices are not that high, the food is good and the vibe is amazing, all the waiters were really nice.\nEverything was really perfect, the only thing I would say that wasn't nice was the lifeguard of the pool in the morning, he's rude, no patience for the kids, and speaks (jokes even) with people in the worst way possible,I guess if he's tired he should just quit, it's a kids place.",

The ticket I got was a paid ticket, but an additional free ticket was given for a carer. It is inside a large property with lots of green space and lovely spots to sit for a picnic.\n\nThe pool was very busy, but the water temperature was nice and refreshing. Lifeguards are on duty and there is a large 3m diving board over a very deep section of the pool. I was able to transfer from my chair onto the raised section (the pool is higher than ground level) and then throw myself into the pool. Getting out I went up the stairs and then slowly made my way back to a spot with my chair. They might have proper equipment for wheelchair access, but I didn't try to find it. I think the lifeguards would offer to help either way (not sure about any potential language barrier). I'm not sure why, but I didn't seem to take any photos of the actual pool. ***insert Homer Simpson “Doh!” here***\n\nOverall, it was a great way to spend a hot afternoon",
