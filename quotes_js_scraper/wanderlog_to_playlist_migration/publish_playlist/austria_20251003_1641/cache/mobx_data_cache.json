              "reviewText": "Visiting Belvedere Palace in Vienna is a feast for the eyes, particularly if you appreciate grand architecture and historic structures. The palace itself is stunning, with intricate interiors and elegant layouts that make wandering through its halls a visual delight. Even with parts of the building under restoration, the charm and grandeur of the palace remain impressive.\n\nThe exhibition, however, is less remarkable. While it has its moments, it doesn’t quite match the awe-inspiring atmosphere created by the palace and its architecture. Art lovers may enjoy it, but for those primarily seeking a “wow” factor, it may feel underwhelming.\n\nA practical note: the queues can be long, especially on weekends. Even if you buy tickets online, you may have to wait for a later slot; when we arrived, our online tickets only allowed entry three hours later. Planning ahead and booking well in advance is highly recommended.\n\nThe gardens are fantastic and free to explore. Locals often jog, run, or just relax there, and it's lovely to see artists drawing or people chilling. Overall, the views and grounds make it worth avisit!\n\nOverall, Belvedere Palace is worth visiting for its architecture and historical appeal, but don’t set your expectations too high for the exhibitions."

Where it really shines though is the inside. The art collection is absolutely incredible and is something you should not miss in Vienna. It is so amazing to come here and admire works of art and to learn about the history of that art, and the artists behind it. The kiss is the main draw of the Belvedere for many, it is much more beautiful in person than what you would expect. I would definitely recommend buying tickets in advance and coming in the morning is the way to go here because of the crowds."

But we did not buy any ticket and directly visited the garden behind the palace. The garden is really humongous and beautiful.  The center has beautiful flowers followed by fountain. Also beautiful place to click a photo or two.\n\nAs the garden is so huge I saw some people there for their morning stroll. Hey Perplexity, rewrite it and adjust the tone and grammatical errors.\n\nThe palace is truly stunning. Access to the museums inside and certain sections of the garden requires a ticket, but without purchasing one, it’s still possible to visit the garden area behind the palace. The gardens are vast and beautifully maintained, with vibrant flowers at the center leading toward a lovely fountain. The scenery makes it an excellent spot for photos. Given the sheer size of the gardens, it’s common to see people enjoying a morning stroll there."

              "reviewText": "Wow! What a beautiful place! I would say this is a must see for any tourists. The grounds are so incredible and have so much to do. If you have several days in Vienna I recommend at least half a day to see everything here including the gardens, zoo, labyrinth, Gloriette, and palace interior. The gardens and land alone are worth devoting at least an hour or two of your time to. As for the inside I would say get the palace pass unless you are wanting to see more of the palace. The palace pass gets you access to many rooms and a gift shop at the end and there is an audio tour available in several languages. The palace is decorated with authentic furniture to replicate what it would have been like at its prime. The palace was moderately busy but manageable and in the gardens you hardly notice most of the crowds. on the inside it can be hard to squeeze past people or move along when there’s a crowd, so I would recommend trying to go in the earlier morning when it opens. Buy tickets in advance if you want a planned time slot, but if you’re fine waiting for about an hour and a half, or more, buying tickets there is perfectly fine. Also… don’t stand on the grass or places that you’re not supposed to!"

The Baroque architecture is absolutely magnificent, and the grounds are just as impressive. The massive garden stretches behind the palace with the Gloriette perched on the hill, offering one of the best views in Vienna. My tip – start your visit at the Gloriette first and snap some photos of the entire palace and gardens from the balcony. Then, take a leisurely stroll down the hill, through the fountains and perfectly manicured paths, and make your way to the palace entrance.\n\nThe inside tour requires a ticket, but it’s worth every euro. The lavish interiors and rich history give you a true appreciation of the opulent lifestyle of the royal family. We were in awe of the intricate details and grandeur of each room – it really transports you back in time. For even more context, check out the Netflix series The Empress before or after your visit – it adds another layer of appreciation. A must-do when in Vienna!"

Once a residential palace , later transfomed into an art museum by Maria Christine ( daughter of Queen Maria Theresa)and her husban Albert, hence the name - Alberina.\nGreat collection of modern and contemporary art.  Albrecht Dürer famous Hare , Modigliani Female Semi Nude, some Picasso, Klimt are just a few highlights of the collection.\nI was lucky to see Matthew Wong exhibition here. What a wonderful discovery! I enjoyed every painting of it.\nDon't miss the terrace featured in the movie  The Tabacconist.\nLoved my visit and would come back to enjoy more next time I'm in Vienna."

Top floor of Albertina museum hosts an amazing collection entitled From Monet To Picasso that is a home to many pieces by Monet, Renoir, Kandinsky, Kokoshka, and Picasso. Admission is reasonable: as of July 2025, children under 19 get in free, and my adult ticket was 19 euros. Audioguides are free for children and 5 euros for adults, those are available in all major languages. The museum building itself is absolutely georgeous."

I came for a visit on a Friday afternoon as the museum is open until 9 with less people.\nI have to say paying the extra 5 euro for the audio guide you download on your phone was worth every penny. It gave me such a deeper understanding of the collections and paintings. The narrator connects big part of the paintings from the exhibitions with history, background and interesting tidbits of information about the artists. I felt totally immersed in one world at a time for each part I visited.\nI started with the Matthew Wong (a Canadian artist I didn’t know about but was totally mesmerized by his art) and Van Gogh, this was such a moving exhibition especially when you learn about the life and struggles of both and connect this to their paintings.\nThe Monet to Picasso exhibit spanned many painters and touched on my favourite Impressionism.\nThen I saw the fascinating exhibition on drawings on coloured backgrounds Leonardo -Durer, so interesting!\n2.5 hours went by so quickly and that wasn’t even all of the museum. I hope to be able to return and see more exhibition at this beautiful place.\nIn summary, this is lovely place if you love art and it is well organized and presented. Get the audio guide and prepare to be absolutely immersed in a different world. Superb!"

The cloakroom, lockers and the toilet are located before ticketing. Cloakroom costs some euro (can’t remember if it’s 1€ or 2€, only cash) but if you don’t have any money for it, the staff will give you token for the lockers - that’s really useful, thank you so much!\n\nI recommend buying ticket online but it’s not a big deal cause queue was minimal (at least on Monday 12PM). After the ticket office area, you enter the exhibition, cafe and shop place. The staff is giving u some sort of sticker and if you want to came back to lockers or something they would know that you already bought a ticket.\n\nThe most impressive collection is the one located on level 2 - MONET TO PICASSO. The Batliner Collection. It’s a a comprehensive exhibition of the most important art of the XIX and XX centuries (names such as: Monet, Degas, Signac, Klimt, Matisse, die Brücke artists i.e. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt Rottluff, Munch, Kandinsky, Klee, Kupka, Magritte, Miró, Picasso). Don’t know why there wasn’t Francis Bacon and Marc Chagall on display.\n\nOn the first floor there are also quite charming rooms - Prunkräume, which could be interesting to people fond of this period - however everyone should see in the last of rooms works by Albrecht Dürer.\n\nPrices in shop btw:\nMagnet - 4,90€,\nPostcards - 1,5-2€,\nMonet to Picasso exhibition book - 19,90€."

If you want to go you should bring some snacks Bring some water because they don't have the fountains that they usually have in Vienna In summertime And make a whole picnic out of it make the experience more than just the villa because it's not really ideal for Exclusively visiting the Villa and then leaving especially since it's so far away from the city. The park is stunning they have a lot of information about the reserve of the plants and the animals there's a lot of bugs so bring some spray there's a lot to do in the area but a few places are barred off and you can't walk through them. Schedule more time than you think you need because you'll probably want to spend time just to roam around the greenery."

You would see  Vienna from before humanity to our time.\nI personally love museums of this kind - spacious but without choking amounts of artifacts,  so you can pay attention to every item on display.\nNote that there are original statues from St. Stephan Cathedral in the museum. The ones that you see on the walls of the Cathedral are replicas.\nMy favorite parts were the Masonic section and Klimt.\nYou can easily spend a whole day here. Nice cafe on the premises will keep you charged.\nDid I mention it's free? Yep! It's."

There is even a small movie theatre where you can watch films that were shown at that time. I also liked how the text is very interesting and at the same time easy to understand. I went in the morning on Thursday and it wasn’t really crowded. Definitely recommend visiting the museum."

              "reviewText": "One of the very few museums that is free in Vienna, as we all know that all museums here are pretty expensive to get in. This one is free for the permanent exhibition on three floors which could easily take you at least a couple of hours to get through them. So picture you have enough time to look through all these interesting artifacts.\n\nI would say that the contents were all quite interesting but there's just a little bit too much of reading. At least they have translations in both German and English all over. But maybe the lack of curation pertaining to those who are not familiar with Vienna it is quite hard to understand the contents and follow what is going on.\n\nBut I guess these pieces of mental jigsaws will be completely put together as we move around the cities and keeping in mind what we have seen here at the museum, especially in the area of infrastructural building, cultural underpinnings, and a deep history of art and culture that is embedded within every fabric of how the city operates.\n\nThe top floor of the building has a really nice balcony where you can have wine and coffee. But you can always just come up here and enjoy the sightseeing and scenery of the bird's eye view of the central Vienna as well for free. So recommend that a lot to those people who want to find a spot to sit down and relax without having to spend money."

The stallions are beautiful, so is the building! I highly recommend also booking the tour of their stables, it’s a very informative tour, where you may take photos in most areas!

I watched the morning exercises of the horses, and I was mesmerized by their elegance and poise.\n\nAt the beginning they request everyone not to take photos and videos of horses during the entire show.\n\nThe training session was impressive, with skilled riders expertly guiding the horses through intricate maneuvers. The horses' movements were fluid and precise, showcasing their exceptional training and discipline.\n\nWhat struck me most was the obvious bond between the horses and their riders. The trust, respect, and affection were palpable, making the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nThe facilities where the show was conducted were immaculate, with beautifully maintained seats and galleries. The Institution has an history of 460 years of horse training and breeding the pure lineage.\n\nRecommended for: Horse lovers, equestrian enthusiasts, and anyone seeking a unique experience in Vienna!\"\n\nPlease press ❤️ if you like my review"

Fair amount of standing only had already started to find their places by that time, and we guessed somewhere in the middle would be best but equally think somewhere about a third of the way down each end would also work.\n\nIf you’re not interested in horsemanship or have never watched dressage, you might not find this show as “entertaining” but it really is lovely to watch."

If you're expecting breathtaking pirouettes or mind-blowing tricks, you're in for another bitter disappointment.\nAdd to this the fact that prices range from a few hundred euros for a premium numbered seat to around 25 euros for an unreserved standing place (first come, first served),\nand that's for only a 45 minutes show,\nand that you have to wait in line for over 30 minutes to even have a chance of getting a good standing place...\nIt's up to you to do the math and decide if it's worth it.\n\nI'll probably surprise you by saying it's worth it!\nYou're in Vienna, and the setting and atmosphere are unique.\nAfter all, you're in a wing of the Hofburg, and the experience is priceless."

But, worth every penny.\n\nAmazing display of Horsemanship.\n\nAnd of course Rider talent was at a level never seen by me before.\n\nA bit confusing getting to the right section of stairways leading to the show area, but there is help around to assist.\n\nNext to the ZOO this was my favorite Animal related thing to do in Vienna."

We selected the ticket at €26 (standing) each to see a 45 minute show which began at 11am.\n\nClearly there is emphasis to sell many tickets as there were so many people it was hard to move causing a concern if a fire started.\n\nStaff could learn some manners by the way they talk to visitors.\n\nThe 45 minute show itself was in 3 parts and really the 3rd part was the best which I would call a show and not rehearsals dressed up to look like a show.\n\nOh yes, apparently you are not allowed (abruptly told to not do so) to take video or photographs so here is what I managed to take!\n\nViewing the stables does not cost anything.\n\nClearly counting on the fame of the riding school for people to book without any care for them."

Yes it's cheaper to stand and you get not a bad view but you get a much better view sitting down. Also no rucksacks are allowed inside the area, But i found  left luggage lockers at Vienna Central Station for my small rucksack for 2 euros ( Sept 2025 prices)\nIt only goes on for approx 1 hrs and 10 mins but so enjoyable in a beautiful area.\nThe riders were brilliant in their handling of the horses and the classical music complented the moves the riders made. The lippinaners are so strong and you even see some young lippinaners. The whole experience is just a lovely, feel good, watch."

Even though I’m not typically into classical music, I found the performance beautiful and easy to enjoy. The venue wasn’t huge, with just six musicians and two opera singers, so it felt intimate rather than grand, but the sound was still impressive.\nI had a B-class ticket and was pleasantly surprised to be seated fairly close to the front, where I had a clear view. One thing to note is that in winter, coats have to be stored and they charge 1 euro per coat.\nI purchased my ticket through an app, which was quick and convenient. Overall, a fantastic experience!"

I don't know how but I missed that the audio tours were free, meaning that I did not grasp the entire story. It was, however, beautiful to see various dresses and objects touched or owned by Sisi. Apparently a royal bed for one was just a regular sized bed and not king sized bed for Sisi."

The dining area was under construction, which was disappointing, especially after a long visit.\n\nMany of the famous furniture pieces I had seen online were missing or not on display, which made the experience feel incomplete. I also ended up having to walk through the entire museum twice because large sections were blocked by tour groups, making it hard to access certain areas the first time around.\n\nThe architecture is beautiful, and there are some interesting exhibits, but the overall experience didn’t meet my expectations."

We know the building can’t be changed but maybe some slotted opening/max allowance of people at each time could change this. We were unable to enjoy it since we got pushed constantly by people in the narrow walkways.\n\nWe visited other museums that had much more original pieces and impressed us much more.\n\nGood not great."

It’s inside the Hofburg Palace, which already feels super regal, and the way they tell Empress Elisabeth’s story is honestly captivating. You get to see her dresses, personal items, and even read about her intense fitness routines and poetry. It dives into both the glam and the pressure of royal life, and you leave feeling like you actually got to know her."

While I was familiar with Sisi’s story, I found the Audioguide packed with great information about her life. Through her personal items, clothing, portraits and living space, you could feel somewhat closer to her and her poetry really showcased her feeling of being an outsider in the rigid court life.\nI had also visited her palace in Corfu and it was interesting to compare this ornate but somewhat cold palace to the sunny and open villa on Corfu where she trying to find solace from her pain and mental anguish.\nIf you are fascinated by Sisi’s story like I am, this is a “Do not miss”."

Upon our arrival we noticed that the room had not been cleaned (think dirty towels on the floor and stains on the sheets), so we called the number and they put us in a different property, which was across town, making us miss a reservation. The new accomodations had communal bathrooms and kitchens  (when we had paid for our own), a broken window (it's February) and a fire alarm that was out of battery so it kept beeping every thirty seconds all night long. We called again in the morning asking to be put back in the room we had paid for, with the assurance that it would be clean at three o'clock. It was not. Nobody had been there, at which point (after another phone call assuring us it would be fine in the evening) we cancelled our reservation (fool me twice). The one star is for the friendly support staff on the phone. Unbelievable."

The sculpture is larger than life and depicts Albrecht at his most impressive.\n\nThe monument is located at the Albertina, on the Augustinian Bastion just outside the entrance on the upper level, but you’ll likely spot it if walking towards the art gallery as it’s pretty high up."

The statue overlooks Albertina-platz and can be seen clearly from this area.\n\nArchduke Albert (1847-1895) served notably in the Austria-Hungary army. His monument was designed by German sculptor Kaspar von Zumbusch in 1898-99 and depicts the Archduke in military attire, riding his horse confidently. He seems to be peering into the distance. The statue is situated upon a oval shaped pedestal with decorative bronze reliefs on each side.\n\nTake a few minutes to view an enjoy this monument before entering Albertina Museum, if you enjoy this time of sightseeing during your travels."

Our guide, Michael, provided an exceptional tour filled with insightful commentary and a wealth of knowledge.\n\nMichael's passion for history and the palace garden was evident from the moment the tour began. His deep understanding of the site's historical significance and attention to detail truly brought the place to life. He expertly navigated us through the expansive garden, sharing captivating stories and anecdotes that made the tour both educational and entertaining.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was Michael's ability to cater to the diverse interests and questions of the group. He effortlessly engaged with everyone, ensuring that each person felt included and their curiosity was satisfied. His friendly and approachable demeanor made the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nThe tour itself was well-structured and paced perfectly. We had ample time to appreciate the stunning beauty of the garden, explore hidden corners, and take in the breathtaking views. Michael's ability to provide historical context and explain the intricate details of the garden's design added an extra layer of appreciation to the experience.\n\nI highly recommend Prime Tours Vienna and their Free Walking Tour Schönbrunn Palace Garden to anyone visiting Vienna.

Aber von dem Moment an, als wir die Downtown Residence betreten haben, wussten wir, dass wir die richtige Entscheidung getroffen hatten.\nDas Personal ist nicht nur äußerst professionell, sondern auch unglaublich warmherzig und geduldig. Meine Oma fühlte sich vom ersten Tag an willkommen und gut aufgehoben. Die liebevolle Betreuung und die zahlreichen Aktivitäten, die hier angeboten werden, haben ihr neue Unterhaltung und Aktivität gegeben, die wir uns so gewünscht haben.\nDie Einrichtung selbst ist modern, hell und sehr sauber. Das Apartment ist vom besten Standard und bieten ausreichend Platz, während die Gemeinschaftsbereiche einladend gestaltet sind, sodass sie immer Gesellschaft hat, wenn sie möchte.\n\nWas uns besonders beeindruckt hat, ist die offene Kommunikation mit den Mitarbeitern. Sie nehmen sich immer die Zeit, uns über den Gesundheitszustand meiner Oma auf dem Laufenden zu halten und auf all unsere Fragen einzugehen.\nEs ist ein beruhigendes Gefühl zu wissen, dass sie hier in guten Händen ist und sie die Unterstützung bekommt, die sie braucht.\n\nDanke an das gesamte Team."

              "reviewText": "(Translated by Google) Before I decided to move to the Josefstadt Residence, I 'test lived' there twice for a week each. No horse foot found. I've been living here for over a year now - still no smell of the devil. As I got older, I became quite afraid of them\nghastly senior citizen storage establishments, the ones with the bright furniture and colorful faux leather covers on the seats; Nurses who pat you on the cheeks, more or less firmly...\nNone of this in the Josefstadt Residence. The unfurnished apartments are simply well planned and high-class: 3.40 meters high, white walls in all apartments, light parquet on underfloor heating (individually controlled), box windows - not even the tram makes any noise; Because of the solid construction in 1905, you can't hear the neighbors, upper and lower bars either. Electric blinds. Everything is wheelchair accessible, as is the entire house; 6 red alarm buttons in the apartment with a direct connection to the nursing department. The fitted kitchens are first class furnished and equipped. Miele washing machine and dryer in an extra room on each floor. The underground car park can be reached via a lift directly from the living level. The restaurant is subtle, beautiful and very well lit, not at all in the old people's home style that I fear. The food is very good and presented in an aesthetically pleasing manner. Richest breakfast from the buffet. There is enough choice every day and dietary requirements are taken into account. The whole thing under the highly competent, friendly leadership of the director, with selected, attentive, interested, professional helpers.\nI had always admired Coco Chanel, or Udo Lindenberg, because they lived in the Ritz or Atlantic, instead of in the property. And now I can feel the same way:\nTotal satisfaction (even for the dog, which you are allowed to bring with you - it is included in the rental agreement with a photo and has its run in the dog zone on Hamerlingplatz). And that too in the middle of Vienna! Where else?\n\n(Original)\nBevor ich mich entschlossen habe, in die Residenz Josefstadt zu ziehen, habe ich zweimal je eine Woche lang dort 'probegewohnt'. Keinen Pferdefuß gefunden. Jetzt wohne ich seit über einem Jahr hier - immer noch kein Teufel zu riechen. Mit zunehmendem Alter hatte ich eine ziemliche Angst bekommen vor den\nschauerlichen Senioren-Aufbewahrungs-Etablissements, denen mit den hellen Möbeln und farbigen Kunstlederbezügen auf den Sitzen; Pflegern, die einem die Wangen tätscheln, mehr oder weniger feste......\nNichts davon in der Residenz Josefstadt. Die unmöblierten Wohnungen sind einfach gut geplant und hochklassig ausgeführt: 3,40 Meter hoch, in allen Appartements weisse Wände, helles Parkett auf Fußbodenheizung (individuell zu regeln), Kastenfenster - nicht einmal die Tram macht sich laut; wegen der soliden Bauweise im Jahr 1905 hört man auch die Nach- Ober- und Unterbarn nicht. Elektrische Jalousien. Alles rollstuhlgerecht, wie das gesamte Haus; 6 rote Alarmknöpfe in der Wohnung mit direktem Anschluss in die Pflegeabteilung. Die Einbauküchen sind erstklassig eingerichtet  und ausgestattet. In einem Extra-Raum pro Etage Waschmaschine und Trockner von Miele. Die Tiefgarage erreicht man via Lift direkt von der Wohnebene. Das Restaurant ist dezent, schön und sehr gut beleuchtet, absolut nicht in dem von mir so gefürchteten  Altenheimstil. Das Essen ist sehr gut, wird ästhetisch ansprechend präsentiert. Reichhaltigstes Frühstück vom Buffet. Man hat täglich genügend Auswahl, auf Diätnotwendigkeiten wird geachtet. Das Ganze unter der hochkompetenten, liebenswürdigen Leitung der Direktorin, mit ausgesuchten,  zugewandten, interessierten, professionellen Helfern.\nIch hatte immer Coco Chanel bewundert, oder auch Udo Lindenberg, weil sie im Ritz wohnten bzw. Atlantic, statt im Eigentum. Und jetzt darf ich mich ähnlich fühlen:\nauf Händen getragene Zufriedenheit  (selbst für den Hund, den man mitbringen darf - er steht mit Foto im Mietvertrag und hat seinen Auslauf in der Hundezone auf dem Hamerlingplatz). Und das auch noch mitten in Wien! Wo sonst?"

This is the only so-called Strandbad (beach swimming pool) requiring an entry fee that we’ve included in this list, and there’s a damn good reason for this – because this ol’ favourite is as much a Viennese experience as is waltzing while wearing a Mozart wig, eating a Manner schnitte, and drinking a Spritzer – at the same time.",

On one side, you’ll find a peaceful and charming green area with a pond full of ducks, perfect for a relaxing walk, biking, or even a picnic under the trees. It's an ideal spot to unwind, enjoy nature, or just let the kids run free while you sit back and take in the serene atmosphere.\n\nOn the other side of the park is a huge amusement area that’s packed with games and attractions for all ages. From thrilling rides to fun games for kids, there's something here for everyone. We tried the giant Ferris wheel, which gave us amazing views — definitely a highlight! The ride cost €6 per person, and it was well worth it. Keep in mind that while entry to the general park is free, each amusement game or ride has its own separate fee.\n\nThere’s also a fantastic section within the park filled with restaurants! you can visit day or night. It’s a great area to relax after a walk or a fun ride, and it's equally enjoyable for both adults and kids.\n\nAll in all, this park is a must-visit. Whether you're looking for a calm afternoon in nature or an exciting day of fun, it has it all in one place!"

The atmosphere alone makes it worth a visit. There are tons of rides and amusement games, from family-friendly options to seriously thrilling ones.\n\nI only managed to try the Ferris wheel. The ride goes for three rounds, and the view at the top is beautiful, but honestly, I’d recommend going for the newer Ferris wheel instead—it feels like the better option. I didn’t get to play the games, but walking around, you can tell it’d be a really fun spot if you had the time.\n\nOne thing to note: most rides and games are individually priced. This works if you know exactly what you want to try, but if you’re hoping to experience everything, it might add up quickly. I didn’t come across a proper “all-access” pass, though maybe one exists. Still, it’s an exciting place to wander, soak in the vibes, and jump on a few rides that catch your eyes."

The level of detail here is incredible – every corner feels like a work of art, from the ornate ceilings to the grand staircases.\n\nThe performance was equally stunning. The orchestra and opera singers were on another level – so powerful and moving that even though I’m not usually into classical music, I loved every minute of it. This was truly an unforgettable experience and one of those bucket-list items you absolutely have to check off when visiting Vienna."

They separated families, unlike in the USA, Canada and almost anywhere, where people will switch out individuals if they have fixed people to tour, here, they don't understand and sounded rude.\n\nThe Opera is a historical early modern place of networking and pompous and continues today, and also, it is maybe the most inefficient way of doing stages and keep the jobs.\n\nThat said, enjoyed the seeing The Opera, our tour guide was excellent,most importantly 30 second seating at the biggest and the best, king's box."

There's a shop where u can buy all the swimming things and rent some rackets to play tennis (3€ for 1h). The sun loungers are free and u can put them wherever you need, something AMAZING.\nThe restaurant/bar it's really comfortable and the prices are not that high, the food is good and the vibe is amazing, all the waiters were really nice.\nEverything was really perfect, the only thing I would say that wasn't nice was the lifeguard of the pool in the morning, he's rude, no patience for the kids, and speaks (jokes even) with people in the worst way possible,I guess if he's tired he should just quit, it's a kids place."

There’s a lifeguard on duty always.\n\nThere’s a wide variety of things to do, if swimming is not on the agenda. The location is very big, it has a football field, volleyball and a restaurant/ cafe.\nI recommend packing your own food, as it’s quite expensive inside. If you forgot to bring a swimsuit or want an inflatable floatie, you can always buy one there.\nThe price of a day ticket is a bit steep, especially if you want to go daily during the summer. If that’s your plan, I recommend getting a month ticket."

The ticket I got was a paid ticket, but an additional free ticket was given for a carer. It is inside a large property with lots of green space and lovely spots to sit for a picnic.\n\nThe pool was very busy, but the water temperature was nice and refreshing. Lifeguards are on duty and there is a large 3m diving board over a very deep section of the pool. I was able to transfer from my chair onto the raised section (the pool is higher than ground level) and then throw myself into the pool. Getting out I went up the stairs and then slowly made my way back to a spot with my chair. They might have proper equipment for wheelchair access, but I didn’t try to find it. I think the lifeguards would offer to help either way (not sure about any potential language barrier). I’m not sure why, but I didn’t seem to take any photos of the actual pool. ***insert Homer Simpson “Doh!” here***\n\nOverall, it was a great way to spend a hot afternoon"

Despite the crowd, the pool area was well-maintained, and there was plenty of space around for families to set up picnic spots.

But we did not buy any ticket and directly visited the garden behind the palace. The garden is really humongous and beautiful.  The center has beautiful flowers followed by fountain. Also beautiful place to click a photo or two.\n\nAs the garden is so huge I saw some people there for their morning stroll. Hey Perplexity, rewrite it and adjust the tone and grammatical errors.\n\nThe palace is truly stunning. Access to the museums inside and certain sections of the garden requires a ticket, but without purchasing one, it’s still possible to visit the garden area behind the palace. The gardens are vast and beautifully maintained, with vibrant flowers at the center leading toward a lovely fountain. The scenery makes it an excellent spot for photos. Given the sheer size of the gardens, it’s common to see people enjoying a morning stroll there."

              "reviewText": "Wow! What a beautiful place! I would say this is a must see for any tourists. The grounds are so incredible and have so much to do. If you have several days in Vienna I recommend at least half a day to see everything here including the gardens, zoo, labyrinth, Gloriette, and palace interior. The gardens and land alone are worth devoting at least an hour or two of your time to. As for the inside I would say get the palace pass unless you are wanting to see more of the palace. The palace pass gets you access to many rooms and a gift shop at the end and there is an audio tour available in several languages. The palace is decorated with authentic furniture to replicate what it would have been like at its prime. The palace was moderately busy but manageable and in the gardens you hardly notice most of the crowds. on the inside it can be hard to squeeze past people or move along when there’s a crowd, so I would recommend trying to go in the earlier morning when it opens. Buy tickets in advance if you want a planned time slot, but if you’re fine waiting for about an hour and a half, or more, buying tickets there is perfectly fine. Also… don’t stand on the grass or places that you’re not supposed to!"

              "reviewText": "If you want to get a glimpse of how royalty lived, Schönbrunn Palace and its gardens are a must-see! This is one of favorite visits in Vienna. The Baroque architecture is absolutely magnificent, and the grounds are just as impressive. The massive garden stretches behind the palace with the Gloriette perched on the hill, offering one of the best views in Vienna. My tip – start your visit at the Gloriette first and snap some photos of the entire palace and gardens from the balcony. Then, take a leisurely stroll down the hill, through the fountains and perfectly manicured paths, and make your way to the palace entrance.\n\nThe inside tour requires a ticket, but it’s worth every euro. The lavish interiors and rich history give you a true appreciation of the opulent lifestyle of the royal family. We were in awe of the intricate details and grandeur of each room – it really transports you back in time. For even more context, check out the Netflix series The Empress before or after your visit – it adds another layer of appreciation. A must-do when in Vienna!"

Organisation was great, but inside there is no Tribune for the public and only one emergency door in one angle to go out and breathe... basically a sauna inside during the whole day.\nOn one side, the pool is 1.30m deep and has no trampoline. Hence, the start is slower, and Rollwende is less smooth.\nWardrobes are clean.\nI would say not ideal for competitions, but nice to go swimming there."

There is a slide but it is more for little kids rather than adults as well. The water was mostly clean even though there were little natural waste coming from the wind. The pool is 10m deep and it's widths weren't clearly shown so I can't say. Overall nice relaxing experience. It could have been better but that's for other pools to decide."

One can buy food in the cafeteria or the kiosks. The downside: The water doesn't appear to be too clean and the place in general is a bit gunky. Additionally, on hot summer's days, the place is packed full with people. Concluding, I would say that Ottakringer Bad is fine, but there is certainly room for improvement."

Only half a lane is kept somewhat clear for swimmers who try to get a workout in, but its hard when its next to the jumping board. Kids and teens can jump from the sides as you try to swim in the lane kept up for swimmers, they don't get whistled at. Often the lifeguards would just whistle then look the other way, nobody knowing why they whistled or what a person did wrong. Yet they would focus in on a few youngsters just floating by the edge, not doing anything, not blocking the way but they would get picked at. At the buffet they have 3 different langos, but if you are hungarian you can forget about sour cream and cheese. Despite that the staff at the buffet was friendly, the cashiers at the entrance were dismissive and rude."

Once a residential palace , later transfomed into an art museum by Maria Christine ( daughter of Queen Maria Theresa)and her husban Albert, hence the name - Alberina.\nGreat collection of modern and contemporary art.  Albrecht Dürer famous Hare , Modigliani Female Semi Nude, some Picasso, Klimt are just a few highlights of the collection.\nI was lucky to see Matthew Wong exhibition here. What a wonderful discovery! I enjoyed every painting of it.\nDon't miss the terrace featured in the movie  The Tabacconist.\nLoved my visit and would come back to enjoy more next time I'm in Vienna."

Top floor of Albertina museum hosts an amazing collection entitled From Monet To Picasso that is a home to many pieces by Monet, Renoir, Kandinsky, Kokoshka, and Picasso. Admission is reasonable: as of July 2025, children under 19 get in free, and my adult ticket was 19 euros. Audioguides are free for children and 5 euros for adults, those are available in all major languages. The museum building itself is absolutely georgeous."

I came for a visit on a Friday afternoon as the museum is open until 9 with less people.\nI have to say paying the extra 5 euro for the audio guide you download on your phone was worth every penny. It gave me such a deeper understanding of the collections and paintings. The narrator connects big part of the paintings from the exhibitions with history, background and interesting tidbits of information about the artists. I felt totally immersed in one world at a time for each part I visited.\nI started with the Matthew Wong (a Canadian artist I didn’t know about but was totally mesmerized by his art) and Van Gogh, this was such a moving exhibition especially when you learn about the life and struggles of both and connect this to their paintings.\nThe Monet to Picasso exhibit spanned many painters and touched on my favourite Impressionism.\nThen I saw the fascinating exhibition on drawings on coloured backgrounds Leonardo -Durer, so interesting!\n2.5 hours went by so quickly and that wasn’t even all of the museum. I hope to be able to return and see more exhibition at this beautiful place.\nIn summary, this is lovely place if you love art and it is well organized and presented. Get the audio guide and prepare to be absolutely immersed in a different world. Superb!"

The cloakroom, lockers and the toilet are located before ticketing. Cloakroom costs some euro (can’t remember if it’s 1€ or 2€, only cash) but if you don’t have any money for it, the staff will give you token for the lockers - that’s really useful, thank you so much!\n\nI recommend buying ticket online but it’s not a big deal cause queue was minimal (at least on Monday 12PM). After the ticket office area, you enter the exhibition, cafe and shop place. The staff is giving u some sort of sticker and if you want to came back to lockers or something they would know that you already bought a ticket.\n\nThe most impressive collection is the one located on level 2 - MONET TO PICASSO. The Batliner Collection. It’s a a comprehensive exhibition of the most important art of the XIX and XX centuries (names such as: Monet, Degas, Signac, Klimt, Matisse, die Brücke artists i.e. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt Rottluff, Munch, Kandinsky, Klee, Kupka, Magritte, Miró, Picasso). Don’t know why there wasn’t Francis Bacon and Marc Chagall on display.\n\nOn the first floor there are also quite charming rooms - Prunkräume, which could be interesting to people fond of this period - however everyone should see in the last of rooms works by Albrecht Dürer.\n\nPrices in shop btw:\nMagnet - 4,90€,\nPostcards - 1,5-2€,\nMonet to Picasso exhibition book - 19,90€."

              "reviewText": "Visiting Belvedere Palace in Vienna is a feast for the eyes, particularly if you appreciate grand architecture and historic structures. The palace itself is stunning, with intricate interiors and elegant layouts that make wandering through its halls a visual delight. Even with parts of the building under restoration, the charm and grandeur of the palace remain impressive.\n\nThe exhibition, however, is less remarkable. While it has its moments, it doesn’t quite match the awe-inspiring atmosphere created by the palace and its architecture. Art lovers may enjoy it, but for those primarily seeking a “wow” factor, it may feel underwhelming.\n\nA practical note: the queues can be long, especially on weekends. Even if you buy tickets online, you may have to wait for a later slot; when we arrived, our online tickets only allowed entry three hours later. Planning ahead and booking well in advance is highly recommended.\n\nThe gardens are fantastic and free to explore. Locals often jog, run, or just relax there, and it's lovely to see artists drawing or people chilling. Overall, the views and grounds make it worth avisit!\n\nOverall, Belvedere Palace is worth visiting for its architecture and historical appeal, but don’t set your expectations too high for the exhibitions."

Where it really shines though is the inside. The art collection is absolutely incredible and is something you should not miss in Vienna. It is so amazing to come here and admire works of art and to learn about the history of that art, and the artists behind it. The kiss is the main draw of the Belvedere for many, it is much more beautiful in person than what you would expect. I would definitely recommend buying tickets in advance and coming in the morning is the way to go here because of the crowds."

The painting is even more breathtaking in person..the colors, the details, and the atmosphere around it make the experience unforgettable.\n\nThe palace itself is beautiful, with lovely gardens and stunning architecture, but my highlight was definitely standing in front of The Kiss.

The views from the swimming pools over the city are incredible, and there are plenty of grassy spots to relax, tan, or just enjoy the peaceful atmosphere.\n\nHowever, be aware that the restaurant prices have become pretty ridiculous in recent years—definitely not budget-friendly. I’d recommend bringing a cooler bag with your own food and drinks if you're planning to stay for a while.\n\nThat said, their French fries are surprisingly great, so maybe worth a small splurge if you’re craving a snack."

In summer you can swim until 22.00 which is super nice for working people, who can NEVER make it into a pool/bath because they close at 19.00 latest. Thats an absolute rarity here and I m happy about it. I hope others would follow their model. In plus, you can eat and drink something as,well. No service though, only self service. The atmosphere there is very casual and relaxed. Freedom in city! Super, when it is hot."

Sometimes food carts set up here in the summer. Gets really busy on nice summer days from about 5 pm till just after sundown."

Unfortunately, there are few places to lie down directly on the lake. There are some benches and there are green areas a few meters from the water. Just around the corner is the Knusperhäuschen, where you can quench your thirst and hunger. You can only park on Raffineriestrasse, from where it's about a 10-minute walk to the lake. The former parking lot is no longer accessible via the Lobgrundstrasse entrance; there is now a barrier there.\nOverall a very pleasant place where you can relax and swim.\n\n(Original)\nDie Panozzolacke ist ein wunderschöner Ausflugsort für die ganze Familie. Das Wasser ist klar, sauber und auch nicht zu kalt. Liegemöglichten gibt es leider wenige direkt am See. Es sind einige Sitzbänke vorhanden und paar Meter vom Wasser entfernt, sind Grünflächen. Gleich ums Eck ist das Knusperhäuschen, wo man den Durst und Hunger stillen kann. Parken kann man nur mehr auf der Raffineriestraße von wo man ca. 10. Gehminuten zum See hat. Den ehemaligen Parkplatz gibt es nicht mehr über die Zufahrt Lobgrundstraße, dort befindet sich jetzt ein Schranken.\nIm großen und ganzen ein sehr angenehmer Ort, wo man schön entspannen und schwimmen kann."

He even mocked guests by mimicking them, which was not only unprofessional but downright disrespectful.\nThe staff looked miserable and were just as unfriendly — no surprise when working under someone like him. Service was incredibly slow, and there was zero sense of hospitality.\n\nThe food was awful! Poorly made and tasteless. The only remotely decent thing we had was the soda, which was literally just mineral water and lemon juice.\n\nThis is not a place to relax or enjoy yourself.

Just right for a hot day (it is 30 degrees centigrade now and getting hotter). Some ducks and small fish are swimming around, so I think the water must be at least somewhat healthy.\n\nThere is a small number people (I came late Friday morning in the middle of July); therefore, it is quiet. Everyone here appears to be local (except yours truly).\n\nFacilities include picnic tables, trash cans, portable toilets, and some trees for shade. There are no snack kiosks, lockers, or any services like that. Nobody works here; everyone is here to enjoy themselves.\n\nThere is a grassy area (see the satellite photos). There are two small sandy areas where you can access the water, as well as a ladder leading up to a concrete landing.\n\nThe slope in the water is very gradual, making it very comfortable to wade in, even for a nervous swimmers, like myself.\n\nThe parts of the lake floor that I went to had small round rocks, which were reasonably comfortable to walk on. Some areas have silt, which is also fairly comfortable, but unstable, and clouds the water when you walk in it."

There is a fenced pool for babies (30-40 cm deep) with a slide, a vast shady area for picnic and rest and a really lovely playground area at the bank, suitable for children of any age. Adults and older children should however swim in the cannal, no other pools available. The water area is clearly marked for swimmers / non-swimmers and there are several floating decks for jumping and playing. One of our most favourite beaches along the Danube."

Entry to the main part is free, though some side sections require a small fee.\nI highly recommend climbing to the top — it costs €6.50 and involves 343 steps. It may sound like a challenge, but it’s not as hard as it seems, and it’s totally worth it! The views over Vienna from the top are spectacular. There's also a small souvenir shop up there, which adds a nice touch to the experience.\n\nThere is an elevator on the other side if you prefer that, but many say the staircase side offers better views (I didn’t try the elevator myself). Plus, climbing up and down is a fun little workout.\n\nSuper recommended — a must-do in Vienna!"

The catacombs below offer a haunting yet fascinating look into Vienna’s past.\n\nSt. Stephen’s is more than a monument — it’s an active place of worship and a witness to Austria’s key historical moments. It survived World War II bombings and became a symbol of Vienna’s resilience and cultural pride.\n\nWhether you're admiring its facade, exploring its interior, or attending a concert, St. Stephen’s Cathedral is a must-visit landmark that captures the essence of Vienna."

The palace itself is stunning, with intricate interiors and elegant layouts that make wandering through its halls a visual delight. Even with parts of the building under restoration, the charm and grandeur of the palace remain impressive.\n\nThe exhibition, however, is less remarkable. While it has its moments, it doesn’t quite match the awe-inspiring atmosphere created by the palace and its architecture. Art lovers may enjoy it, but for those primarily seeking a “wow” factor, it may feel underwhelming.\n\nA practical note: the queues can be long, especially on weekends. Even if you buy tickets online, you may have to wait for a later slot; when we arrived, our online tickets only allowed entry three hours later. Planning ahead and booking well in advance is highly recommended.\n\nThe gardens are fantastic and free to explore. Locals often jog, run, or just relax there, and it's lovely to see artists drawing or people chilling. Overall, the views and grounds make it worth avisit!\n\nOverall, Belvedere Palace is worth visiting for its architecture and historical appeal, but don’t set your expectations too high for the exhibitions."

Where it really shines though is the inside. The art collection is absolutely incredible and is something you should not miss in Vienna. It is so amazing to come here and admire works of art and to learn about the history of that art, and the artists behind it. The kiss is the main draw of the Belvedere for many, it is much more beautiful in person than what you would expect. I would definitely recommend buying tickets in advance and coming in the morning is the way to go here because of the crowds."

The Marble hall is impressive, offering breathtaking views of the palace garden.\nMany people come here for Klimt, but it offers so much more to see. The medieval gallery is small and very interesting. I would definitely suggest checking it out.\nBuying tickets in advance is a good idea, as when you come without the tickets you might need to wait for couple of hours to be able to enter the palace. If that happens, go for a walk in the palace garden. Beautiful."

              "reviewText": "if you're a fan of music, or even just beautiful buildings, the tour of the vienna state opera is a must-do. i wasn't sure what to expect, but it was really fascinating.\n​it's a guided tour, so you go with a group and a guide tells you all the stories. they take you through the grand staircases and these incredibly ornate rooms like the tea salon and the marble hall. everything is so elegant and detailed, and it's wild to think that parts of the building had to be rebuilt after being bombed in world war ii. you see the original parts and the restored parts side by side, and it's a cool mix of history.\n​the highlight for me was seeing the auditorium and the stage from different angles. you get to stand in the royal box and look out, and it makes you feel like you're royalty for a second.\n​the tour is about 40 minutes long, and you get so many interesting facts and stories. they tell you about the famous composers and conductors who worked there. it's a really great way to appreciate the opera house even if you don't have time to see a full performance. it's a good idea to check the schedule online and book your tour in advance because they're really popular"

The level of detail here is incredible – every corner feels like a work of art, from the ornate ceilings to the grand staircases.\n\nThe performance was equally stunning. The orchestra and opera singers were on another level – so powerful and moving that even though I’m not usually into classical music, I loved every minute of it. This was truly an unforgettable experience and one of those bucket-list items you absolutely have to check off when visiting Vienna."

They separated families, unlike in the USA, Canada and almost anywhere, where people will switch out individuals if they have fixed people to tour, here, they don't understand and sounded rude.\n\nThe Opera is a historical early modern place of networking and pompous and continues today, and also, it is maybe the most inefficient way of doing stages and keep the jobs.\n\nThat said, enjoyed the seeing The Opera, our tour guide was excellent,most importantly 30 second seating at the biggest and the best, king's box."

I had made a point to dress up, dropping off my tourist garb in the cloak room, but many did not. The opera I attended was sold out so I was lucky to get standing tickets in the Stehparterre section, which still offered good views. It was a mesmerizing evening where I enjoyed music masterpieces, angelic voices, while surrounded by rich Viennese history. It took some planning to score tickets but it was a worthwhile endeavor for me."

But we did not buy any ticket and directly visited the garden behind the palace. The garden is really humongous and beautiful.  The center has beautiful flowers followed by fountain. Also beautiful place to click a photo or two.\n\nAs the garden is so huge I saw some people there for their morning stroll. Hey Perplexity, rewrite it and adjust the tone and grammatical errors.\n\nThe palace is truly stunning. Access to the museums inside and certain sections of the garden requires a ticket, but without purchasing one, it’s still possible to visit the garden area behind the palace. The gardens are vast and beautifully maintained, with vibrant flowers at the center leading toward a lovely fountain. The scenery makes it an excellent spot for photos. Given the sheer size of the gardens, it’s common to see people enjoying a morning stroll there."

If you like to listen to everything then this will take a significant amount of time. If you want to quickly look around, read few things and stroll around, it will take an hour or so. Be sure to get into the palace itself by 11am otherwise it can get crowded. I would recommend seeing the gardens and park behind the castle first thing in the morning and then follow it with the castle tour inside. I would highly recommend purchasing the ticket ahead of time. You will not be able to take in your backpack but they have a safe area to store them. The palace is located near the station so it is an easy walk. If you are elderly then it might be difficult to walk to and around the whole castle grounds. This palace is worth the visit."

The Baroque architecture is absolutely magnificent, and the grounds are just as impressive. The massive garden stretches behind the palace with the Gloriette perched on the hill, offering one of the best views in Vienna. My tip – start your visit at the Gloriette first and snap some photos of the entire palace and gardens from the balcony. Then, take a leisurely stroll down the hill, through the fountains and perfectly manicured paths, and make your way to the palace entrance.\n\nThe inside tour requires a ticket, but it’s worth every euro. The lavish interiors and rich history give you a true appreciation of the opulent lifestyle of the royal family. We were in awe of the intricate details and grandeur of each room – it really transports you back in time. For even more context, check out the Netflix series The Empress before or after your visit – it adds another layer of appreciation. A must-do when in Vienna!"

On one side, you’ll find a peaceful and charming green area with a pond full of ducks, perfect for a relaxing walk, biking, or even a picnic under the trees. It's an ideal spot to unwind, enjoy nature, or just let the kids run free while you sit back and take in the serene atmosphere.\n\nOn the other side of the park is a huge amusement area that’s packed with games and attractions for all ages. From thrilling rides to fun games for kids, there's something here for everyone. We tried the giant Ferris wheel, which gave us amazing views — definitely a highlight! The ride cost €6 per person, and it was well worth it. Keep in mind that while entry to the general park is free, each amusement game or ride has its own separate fee.\n\nThere’s also a fantastic section within the park filled with restaurants! you can visit day or night. It’s a great area to relax after a walk or a fun ride, and it's equally enjoyable for both adults and kids.\n\nAll in all, this park is a must-visit. Whether you're looking for a calm afternoon in nature or an exciting day of fun, it has it all in one place!"

The atmosphere alone makes it worth a visit. There are tons of rides and amusement games, from family-friendly options to seriously thrilling ones.\n\nI only managed to try the Ferris wheel. The ride goes for three rounds, and the view at the top is beautiful, but honestly, I’d recommend going for the newer Ferris wheel instead—it feels like the better option. I didn’t get to play the games, but walking around, you can tell it’d be a really fun spot if you had the time.\n\nOne thing to note: most rides and games are individually priced. This works if you know exactly what you want to try, but if you’re hoping to experience everything, it might add up quickly. I didn’t come across a proper “all-access” pass, though maybe one exists. Still, it’s an exciting place to wander, soak in the vibes, and jump on a few rides that catch your eyes."

The grand entrance, the tall columns, and that green dome make it stand out right away. Just walking up to it feels impressive, and the inside is just as beautiful: bright, elegant, and full of baroque details.\n\nWhat made our visit extra special was the Vivaldi concert we attended there in the evening (16/4). Hearing The Four Seasons performed live in such a breathtaking setting was quite an experience. The sound filled the church in the most powerful way – it gave us goosebumps!\n\nWe didn’t go up into the dome, but honestly, just being inside and experiencing the space was more than enough. It’s not a huge church, so you don’t need a ton of time, but it leaves a big impression!"

From the moment you approach the church, its grand baroque façade and massive dome make an unforgettable impression. Inside, the beauty only continues with stunning frescoes, intricate details, and a peaceful, reverent atmosphere.\n\nOne of the most unique parts of visiting Karlskirche is the panoramic elevator that takes you up close to the frescoes in the dome. It’s rare to get such an up-close view of ceiling artwork like this—it really gives you a new appreciation for the craftsmanship and artistry that went into the church’s design.\n\nWhether you're interested in history, architecture, or just want a quiet place to reflect, Karlskirche is a must-visit in Vienna. It’s one of the most beautiful churches I've ever seen, and an unforgettable part of my trip. Highly recommend making time for it!"

Inside, visitors can admire beautiful frescoes and take an elevator up to a viewing platform beneath the dome.

Yet there is a certain irony in this, within a monotheistic tradition - when one believes that God Himself endowed humanity with the wisdom and insight to create works of such breathtaking artistry and architecture.\n\nFanaticism and extremism can never blossom into peace or love among people; they are the very opposite of what the Creator intended.\n\nAnd so, with faith unshaken and confidence in my belief, I can still say without hesitation: Karlskirche is, to my eyes, among the five most magnificent buildings in all of Europe. The interplay of white, green, and gold, perfectly woven into the baroque style, is not merely beautiful - it is a vision that dazzles the soul and lingers in the heart."

There’s a vast selection on offer so it’s tough to choose something! And the ones we tried tasted as good as they looked.\nThe cakes and the beverages were all very reasonably priced too. They also have a full food menu too which is also very reasonably priced.\nAlthough this is known as a touristy place, I would definitely come back and try a meal here. Maybe in the evening so we can enjoy the evening ambience. All in all a lovely experience."

And after finally experiencing it, I completely understand the hype. The café is a beautiful slice of tradition. The interior is stunning - elegant and classic. There is an impressive selection of cakes and pastries, and choosing just a couple was no easy task! We went with the warm chocolate cake (served with vanilla ice cream and fresh cream) and a vanilla puff pastry. The chocolate cake was absolutely the highlight - rich, indulgent, and melt-in-your-mouth good. We also ordered coffee- cappuccino was great, though the latte was just okay. Not bad, but nothing special.\nThe service was pleasant and efficient despite the crowd. And yes, be prepared to wait in a queue, especially during peak times."

The service is exceptional for those in wheelchairs. Just go to the front and they will guide you through a back entrance that has a ramp. We were able to skip the incredibly long line because of this. And the see areas others don’t get to see was a treat."

Furnishings are classy as well. Table was a bit small for the number of things we ordered though.\n\nWe tried the famous pancake. It was not so sweet and nice. The apple pie was surprisingly good though. Together with a nice drink, it was wonderful to soak in the ambience of this classic cafe.\n\nService was prompt and attentive.

Tucked away just off the bustling Graben, it might be easy to miss if you’re not looking for it—but it’s absolutely worth seeking out.\n\nThe baroque architecture is stunning. Every inch of the interior is intricately detailed—gilded sculptures, vivid frescoes, and an altar that practically glows in the natural light filtering through the dome. It’s not a large church, but the sheer amount of craftsmanship packed into the space is astonishing.\n\nEven during busy hours, the atmosphere remains peaceful and reverent. If you’re lucky, you might catch an organ recital or a classical concert in the evening—an experience that feels nothing short of transcendent in such a beautiful setting.\n\nUnlike some other major churches, St. Peter’s is free to enter, though donations are welcome and deserved. It’s an ideal spot to take a quiet break from sightseeing, light a candle, or simply soak in the incredible artistry and serenity.\n\nWhether you’re religious or not, this church is a must-see in Vienna. It’s a masterpiece of design and a perfect reminder of the city’s rich cultural and spiritual history."

The frescoes on the ceiling are mind-blowing, especially the one with the Coronation of Our Lady, and the gilded altars and statues are just dripping with detail. It’s smaller than St. Stephen’s but feels so rich and intimate. Can get busy, so early mornings are best to really take it all in. 5 stars for this beauty."

We were pleased to discover a reliquary of St Clement, the patron saint of Vienna.  The community was welcoming and we were pleased to be able to enjoy the baptism of the newest member of the parish!  The music was enjoyable as well.  The hymnals are in English for the English mass :).   The notes are the same though!"

It is called Mary by the river (the river now had been diverted elsewhere so its no longer by the river :) ) The Redemptorist Missionary priests are caretakers of the Church which is also home to the remains of a great Redemptorist Saint: Saint Clement Maria Hoffbauer CSsR. He is the second patron of the city of Vienna. He played a great role in the city's Catholic revival during an era of heavy enlightenment and anti-religious era. St. Clement together with the city's inteligensia inspired the romantic philosophical movement so that the Catholic heritage, faith and devotion was greatly preserved. I went up to its bell tower and it was magnificent. But you got to ask permission and with a guide from Father Rector Dominic a kind Irish Redemptotist who speaks good German. Please pray there for an increase of vocations in Europe. If you are Filipino, Dr. Jose Rizals place is just few blocks away. Most probably he visited this church as mentioned in his memoires."

              "reviewText": "Maria am Gestade (Mary at the Shore) is located at Salvatorgasse street and is one of Vienna's oldest churches and few remaining examples of Gothic style buildings from the Middle Ages. The churches history dates back to at least the 12th century while the present building was constructed between 1394-1414.\n\nDuring a recent visit, I unfortunately found the church closed to the public so was unable to enter and explore the inside. However, I did very much enjoy walking around the outside, taking in the original Gothic architecture of the building.\n\nMost notably for me were the porticos which are fenced but easy to view. These are decorated nicely with statue reliefs and fresco ornamentation. You can spot a few gargoyles as well on the side of the church building. If you step back across the street in front of the church, you can better view the church tower which rises 56 metre high and dates back to 1428.\n\nIn the end, hopefully others will find the church open for visitation. If not, the exterior is worth a few minutes to enjoy if you are a fan of Gothic architecture.\n\nNote: There is a decent stone fountain called Hannakenbrunnen at the bottom of the staircase leading up to Maria Am Gestade. This is worth checking out as well if you enjoy viewing monuments during your travels."

The cloakroom, lockers and the toilet are located before ticketing. Cloakroom costs some euro (can’t remember if it’s 1€ or 2€, only cash) but if you don’t have any money for it, the staff will give you token for the lockers - that’s really useful, thank you so much!\n\nI recommend buying ticket online but it’s not a big deal cause queue was minimal (at least on Monday 12PM). After the ticket office area, you enter the exhibition, cafe and shop place. The staff is giving u some sort of sticker and if you want to came back to lockers or something they would know that you already bought a ticket.\n\nThe most impressive collection is the one located on level 2 - MONET TO PICASSO. The Batliner Collection. It’s a a comprehensive exhibition of the most important art of the XIX and XX centuries (names such as: Monet, Degas, Signac, Klimt, Matisse, die Brücke artists i.e. Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Karl Schmidt Rottluff, Munch, Kandinsky, Klee, Kupka, Magritte, Miró, Picasso). Don’t know why there wasn’t Francis Bacon and Marc Chagall on display.\n\nOn the first floor there are also quite charming rooms - Prunkräume, which could be interesting to people fond of this period - however everyone should see in the last of rooms works by Albrecht Dürer.\n\nPrices in shop btw:\nMagnet - 4,90€,\nPostcards - 1,5-2€,\nMonet to Picasso exhibition book - 19,90€."

The cabins are big and spacious and they don't stuff them full of people so there's plenty of room to move around and get a good view as it goes around. You'll be able to take some great pictures of Vienna and the panoramic view is spectacular. It was a windy day so there were some points where the cabin swung back and forth which may be scary for some people. If you're afraid of heights it's probably not the best choice but for everyone else it'll probably be worth it. The price is €14.50 for a single ticket."

You ride within large cars that are all enclosed where you can sit or walk around sharing the different views with other riders.  It’s quiet, smooth, solid and feels very safe.  Highly recommend this experience.  Easily purchased my ticket at the ticket desk inside the building below behind the restaurant (a cool dry Saturday evening in May.)  During the summer it might be better to buy online to avoid a long wait. Before going up you get to see a beautiful one-room display of very artfully made models of the park and its history. You can walk through as fast or as slow as you desire."

If you've ever dreamt of seeing a real life princess castle, this is the closest thing to reality.\n\nI love the architecture and design, reminiscent of ancient times, whilst being anchored in our contemporary time. The bright red roof and towers are visible from miles away and are just simply stunning.\n\nI've took lots of photos here and I still think it wasn't enough. The pictures don't make it justice, as I highly recommend that you visit this church to see for yourself. We didn't go inside as it was closed during our outside visit, but I do think you can visit the premises when opened."

On a very first night when we saw the church from our top deck, it looked very beautiful in colorful lights. St. Francis of Assisi Church also known as Kaiser Jubilee Church, is a Basilica style Catholic church in district 2 of Vienna on the banks of Danube. The interior of the church is worth seeing for the lovers of art and architecture. From outside it looks more like a castle. A large striking tower and two bell towers adds to the beauty of church. Beside art nouveau angels with palm leaves in gold mosaic on the ceiling and a large art nouveau chandelier, there are modern paintings by living artists. Worth seeing !!"

Built between 1898 and 1913 to honor Emperor Franz Joseph’s 50th reign anniversary, its unique mix of Romanesque, Byzantine, and Gothic styles makes it look like a charming little castle. The red-tiled pointed and round roofs, along with multiple towers, really stand out on the banks of the Danube Canal near the Reichsbrücke (Empire Bridge). Nice place to visit for architecture lovers and anyone enjoying a scenic walk by the river."

At first I was surprised that such a grand building would be named for such a humble saint; but when I visited, it made more sense.  Unlike the cathedral at the center of Vienna, this place has simple rough doorways.  The inside is beautiful but not opulent.  Instead of sitting in the commercial center of the city, it sits by the river where more of the city’s working class seem to traffic. If you’re looking for a sanctuary of peace in the middle of a hectic vacation; take some time in the morning here to pray and contemplate God’s kindness and beauty."

The grand façade, already beautiful, is transformed with lights and decorations that make it feel like a winter fairy tale. The famous Rathausplatz Christmas Market adds to the charm, with dozens of stalls offering handcrafted gifts, mulled wine, and delicious treats. The ice skating rink and carousel create a cozy, festive atmosphere perfect for families and couples. Even if you’ve seen other Christmas markets, this one feels special with the stunning backdrop of the City Hall. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Vienna during the holidays!"

Its tall spire and detailed façade make it one of the most iconic landmarks in Vienna.\n\nWhen I visited, I only saw it from the outside, but it was during the winter season, and the square in front of the City Hall was transformed into an impressive ice skating rink. It wasn’t just any rink—it was large, beautifully set up, and full of lively energy. Definitely a great spot to visit, even if just to enjoy the festive atmosphere around this magnificent building!"

We enjoyed the atmosphere and they offered great service.\n\nI also loved the fact that even though it was a Saturday evening and they were quite busy, they never rushes us out of the cafe once we finished our cake. This is something you don't see in North America...\n\nNo complaints really other than their rather high price but that was expected given the popularity and location of this cafe."

The atmosphere on the second floor was very pleasant and authentic. I had a slice of Sachertorte — it was delicious and moist. At one point, a waitress accidentally knocked over my water bottle, which fell onto the plate and broke it (there was still about a third of the cake left). The girl apologized and offered to bring me a new slice, but I declined — accidents happen. I had already eaten enough, and overall, everything was wonderful.\n\n2) The second time was around 8:30–9 p.m. with my husband and a friend. This time, we were greeted by a very rude lady who didn’t seem interested in talking to us at all. I understand it was the end of the day, and a lot of tourists pass through, but it was still working hours — being polite is part of the job. After I had told the guys about the delicious cake I had earlier, they decided to order a slice as well. Unfortunately, their pieces were nothing alike — they were dry, oddly flavored, and seemed like they were a few days old. They were quite disappointed.\n\nI must admit, though, that despite the mixed experience, I ended up buying a whole Sachertorte, some chocolate bars, and a fudge from their shop afterward — and all three were divine, far more delicious and moist than the cakes served in the café."

The interior looks like a room of a castle and I felt like a princess from many years ago. And the staff was approachable and nice, too. It is really delightful and I can understand the hype, but there is too many people. My friends and I waited for more than one hour in the line. We tried the Sacher cake and we all agreed that it was a bit dry. We also tried multiple different coffees. Some of them were really good, but not the ice cream one. The ice cream totally melted before even coming to us. I think the Cafe is worth visiting, but a bit overpriced also (price of the cake is okay, but coffee prices are a bit much). Nevertheless, it was a nice experience with lovely views."

Taking orders was sloppy, and the servers just slammed the dishes down on the table without a care. It was obvious the cakes and drinks had been thrown together carelessly. And that female server clearly looked down on Asians.\n\nThe real shock came at checkout. The man who’d seated us asked if 10% was okay, then selected the 10% tip option on the card machine himself with his finger before handing it over. Do they think we’re pushovers because we’re clueless tourists? lol This is the first time I’ve ever had a server choose the tip percentage for me.\n\nWhy is this place still so popular when the food is tasteless and the service is the worst?\nIf you’re in Vienna and trying Sachertorte, absolutely skip this spot and go to the other historic one instead:)"

              "reviewText": "Located at Schonbrunn Palace Park, 1130 Vienna, Austria 🇦🇹.\nI highly recommend purchasing tickets online before going to avoid the long waiting times. Admission is fixed admission times. We paid for the Grand Tour which included an audio guide. I liked this as I could go at my own pace. We explored the entire piano nobile of the palace: in addition to the private apartments of Franz Joseph and Elisabeth, the south-facing reception rooms and the State Apartments. We also got to see the rooms occupied by Maria Theresa. It was fantastic. This cost €32.00 which I think was quite reasonable. Children are €23.00. There’s also the Imperial Tour which cost €27.00 for adults and €19.00 for children. This also includes audio guide. There’s other tours available on the website.\nOne hundred and thirteen metres long, the Palm House consists of a 28-metre high central pavilion and two lateral pavilions which are three metres lower. Linked by tunnel-like passages, the pavilions contain different climatic zones: a ‘cold’ house to the north, a temperate zone in the central pavilion and a tropical zone in the south pavilion. The building itself is work of art, simply beautiful and inside is magnificent, so lovely to just explore and take in the beauty of all the stunning greenery. After exploring everything including the gardens, the palace etc we were there for practically the whole day. We took our time exploring. We had lunch at one of the cafes that is there, the food was delicious. There’s a large selection of places to choose from. We did a lot of walking and I definitely recommend wearing comfortable shoes. Overall, the Palm House was amazing, I truly loved it. Would definitely recommend. Thumbs up!!! 👍👍👍"

For me, it was definitely worth it.\nExotic plants from remote parts of the world, some of them reaching the ceiling of the glass house provokes admiration.\nThere are a couple of spots where you can sit on white benches and just observe and listen the sounds of tropical forest.\nToo bad that the stairs to the gallery were closed, therefore I give it 4/5 star review."

              "reviewText": "The Palmenhaus is absolutely stunning and was one of our favorite parts of Schönbrunn. From the outside it looks like a grand glass cathedral, but stepping inside feels like entering a different world. Towering palms, exotic plants, and the humid air make it feel almost dreamlike, and the structure itself is a work of art with its elegant iron and glass design. It’s easy to lose track of time wandering through the different sections, spotting plants you’ve never seen before and soaking in the atmosphere. Well worth the ticket, and a perfect escape if you want something a little quieter and more magical than the busy palace grounds."

Stepping inside the Palmenhaus is like being instantly transported to a lush, tropical rainforest. The scale is awe-inspiring – the soaring cast-iron and glass structure houses towering palm trees, exotic plants, and a serene atmosphere that feels worlds away from Vienna.\n\nIt’s not just a collection of plants; it's a beautifully curated ecosystem with winding paths, little bridges, and even a small café to sit and soak it all in. The perfect escape for a rainy day or when you need a warm, green retreat. A true jewel of Schönbrunn.\n\nPro Tip: Look up! The architecture of the greenhouse itself is a work of art. And don't miss the butterfly house if it's open."

Was thrilled to see vanilla bean flower and experience its exotic, rich and abundant smell.  Arabica coffee plant was a very educational experience. Resident biologist (?) of the greenhouse was very friendly and happily answered my kids multiple questions. Overall, the Palm House is very family-oriented and kid-friendly facility."

The palace features beautifully preserved Baroque architecture, and the interiors are quite elegant. Highlights include the Marble Hall, the Golden Room, and the Hall of Grotesques, each with intricate designs and a rich history. The palace also hosts special exhibitions, adding a bit of variety to the visit. The surrounding gardens are peaceful and perfect for a stroll. While it may not have the extensive collection of its bigger sibling, it's definitely a worthwhile stop for anyone interested in Austrian art and Baroque architecture. Overall, a solid four-star experience!"

There was a special exhibition centered around the works of Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, which exceeded all my expectations.\n\nSeeing famous works like Klimt's \"Water Serpents I\" and \"Judith\" up close was a truly moving experience. The exhibition also offered a deep dive into Egon Schiele's artistic world through his various drawings and paintings.\n\nWhat impressed me most was the feeling of these vibrant and revolutionary artworks breathing new life into a historic palace. There was a wonderful sense of the past being re-energized and revitalized, which I found truly fantastic.\n\nThe compact size of the exhibition space is actually a plus, as it allows you to appreciate each piece deeply without feeling rushed. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in Viennese Modernism!!"

The huge paintings had been commissioned for the ceiling of the main hall of the University of Vienna, but they were considered pornograhic and grotesque, and Klimt sold them to a private collector instead. In 1945 they were destroyed when retreating nazis set fire to the building they were housed in. Google helped to reconstruct the colours on the basis of old black and white photos.\n\nThe museum itself is much smaller than the Upper Belvedere. There was also a collection of medieval art"

Ornate lavish  baroque architecture, marble statues and columns, elaborate frescoes adorn the ceilings and walls, bookcases that reveal glimpses of rooms behind, and intriguing staircases leading to the unknown.\n\nIt's both fascinating and breathtaking just looking at the detail and the vast collection of historical literature on display.\n\nIn a building where it appears time has stood still, I love the  juxtaposition with the very interesting exhibition looking at  Austria's history from 1925 to the current day. A century in pictures'.\n\nThe State Hall is normally closed on a Monday. However, opening hours change from June, and I was fortunate to stop by on the 1st Monday in June.\n\nDefinitely worth a visit and the €11 entry fee."

The exteriors of the palace can be your historic backdrop of your wallpaper and the royal staircase leading to the art pieces is a statement of grandeur and style in itself. It’s a huge complex so do take out a minimum of 5 hours to experience the museum thoroughly. The cafe on the 3rd floor is usually filled with visitors as well as the photographers. One of the finest museums I ever visited."

The architecture, ceilings, and details are breathtaking – you could easily spend time just admiring the space before even looking at the collections.\n\nAnother highlight is the café right in the center of this magnificent hall.

I have spend days in here and still have not had enough.\n\nIf you grew up in America in the 70s playing Masterpiece  you will recognize no fewer than 5 paintings here.   AMAZING!\n\nEven if you don’t like the collection (weirdo!) it’s still worth visiting the Most Ornate Cafe on Earth under the rotunda.\n\nThe waiters there are divas that somehow see themselves as victims of an awful fate, failing to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the room nor and the wonderful people flowing in from all over the world.\n\nThe cafe always has an unnecessary line.   You can only avoid it my arriving when the museum opens at 10AM.\n\nGoogle made me edit this post because one photos partially showed the buttocks of a bronze statue.    That is absurd and completely unacceptable.\n\nANYTHING on display in a great museum is worthy of sharing ."

It really lit up the whole area – it felt like a fair!\nThey had installed a large screen right in front of the Rathaus building, and the atmosphere was incredible. There were so many food and drink stalls offering cuisine from different places. Aperol had its own little corner – their drinks were great too!\nThe area was so lively. We first went during the day and loved it so much that we went back again in the evening to enjoy the atmosphere. It was even more crowded in the evening, with so many people around. A musical movie was playing on the giant screen, and the whole place was buzzing with energy."

The view is special, extra terrestrial, computer like, isometric as if playing an old school adventure game. As you don’t interact it starts quickly feeling like a dream of a let’s play without commentary. Still my neighbor with the binocular started sleeping after the first 15minutes.\nAlso they used a Saab convertible for the stage design. I mean a Saab!!!!!❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️so highly recommend if in Vienna. It is not really important what play you see.\nI’ll go back tonight."

Fantastic architecture, ornate interior design, and amazing performance. The crowd seemed very posh, the crème of Vienna, when we were there!

Others come in without respect so that they don't have to wait in line anymore. Be careful that someone else doesn't enter in your place. Talk to them respectfully. Because only 25 people can enter. Otherwise you have to wait another hour. Security doesn't do their job by standing at the entrance by the door and asking: how can we help you? All three Security guards are inside and they don't know who respected the queue. And security only comes when they have to let 25 people in! And they don't know how to respect the queue!\n\nOtherwise, very nice, but especially up at the cafe where there is a superb panorama! It's worth the wait and to visit!\n\nYou can eat, drink, it's big inside and outside on the terrace! Only the smell that greets you when you enter the cafe is bad! It seems that their kitchen doesn't work!!! So that tourists can stay in a pleasant smell! When you leave, you'll smell like food.👎👎👎👎"

It’s true, though — you’ll need to wait about an hour to get inside, unless you arrive just before opening time, when there’s no queue yet. Only 25 people are allowed in per hour.\n\nBefore entering, there’s an airport-style security check: all electronic devices and metal objects must be placed in a plastic tray, and bags are thoroughly inspected. My partner was allowed in with a standard-size backpack, but it’s probably a good idea to ask in advance, as this might depend on the security staff on duty. We were lucky to meet a very friendly team, including a helpful, chatty security guard.\n\nThe interior is truly impressive. Visitors have access to the main entrance hall and the central part of the first floor. Afterwards, you can take an elevator up to the 5th floor, where there’s a restaurant and café offering a nice view over Vienna.\n\nIf you have some time and don’t mind a few minor inconveniences at the entrance, it’s definitely a place worth visiting."

However, it did seem like one particular type of butterfly was dominating the space, which was a little underwhelming considering the expectations for more diversity.\n\nThe greenery inside is lush and well-maintained, and the small waterfalls throughout really add to the atmosphere, mimicking a real-life tropical ecosystem beautifully. It’s a very charming and peaceful setting — at least it would be if it wasn’t so crowded. The space itself feels a bit too small for the large number of visitors, which made it harder to fully enjoy the experience.\n\nThe entrance fee is €10, which is reasonable given the uniqueness of the place. It’s also situated in a lovely area surrounded by nice cafés, making it a great spot to plan a day around.\n\nI would recommend expanding the space a bit and introducing more types of butterflies to enhance the experience even further. Overall, I’m giving it four stars — definitely worth a visit if you’re in Vienna, but be prepared for some crowds."

We paid 8€ (student’s price).\nIt feels like you are entering another realm.\nThere were many butterflies, but sadly the big ones didn’t move too much, because they were eating.\nA fun experience that I recommend if you want to do something different.\nPerfect to go with your friends or on a date as well."

Butterflies of all colours and shapes are flying and eating around you, there's a waterfall which noise relaxes you immediately.

The lamb was quite tender, and there was no trace of the lamb odour (my mom hates the smell and was fine eating this dish). The crust of the schnitzel wasn't very crispy, but the meat was okay. The rice side dish is actually surprisingly good (high praise from an Asian family). We were overall quite happy with the experience."

My plan was to visit all the indoor exhibits before closing then enjoy the outdoors hopefully in the cooler hours. It's big and interesting with multiple buildings. High up on the hill, with great views of the city and surrounding areas. One would think this is a great location to defend the city. Ironically, it's not been battle tested after it was built in the 11th century. With the city pass, went up with the cable car and walked down. It would be a good climb to hike up. On a hot summer day, no thanks."

The fortress approach walkway is significantly sloped, covered in fine rock and worn dirt, so wear a good pair of shoes that give good grip.  For anyone with mobility issues or if it's raining/wet, I'd highly recommend the funicular.   While the fortress has an interesting history, I was disappointed that there were not more objects of historical significance inside it.  It's actually pretty sparse inside.  There are some military items, but very few furnishings and no tapestries.  The staff were all very helpful.  The cost of a visit is very reasonable.  The view is unparalleled.  It is truly a commanding view of the surrounding countryside.  Worth doing for the view, but could use more historical/period artifacts inside and around the grounds."

The fortress is very well preserved, with fascinating exhibitions that tell the story of the city and its rich history. The funicular ride to the top is quick and enjoyable, and once you arrive, the atmosphere is simply magical. I highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Salzburg – it’s a must-see landmark full of history, beauty, and charm. 🌟"

The walking trail runs along the historic defence wall and is dotted with viewpoints, small gates, and cultural landmarks.\n\nI explored Mönchsberg as part of my hike down from Fortress Hohensalzburg, first passing the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, then crossing Schartentor before reaching Humboldtterrasse. From here, panoramic vistas unfolded—the red and grey rooftops of the Altstadt, the green domes of Salzburg Cathedral, the Salzach River winding through town, and the Alps beyond.\n\nIt was surprisingly quiet along the trail, with only a few locals enjoying the park and the view, making the walk feel peaceful and unhurried. Eventually, I continued to Klausentor, took a short break at Café am Kai, crossed Müllnersteg footbridge, and returned to Mirabell Palace.\n\n🧭 Tip: This is one of Salzburg’s best free activities. Come in the late afternoon for softer light and fewer people. Wear comfortable shoes—the trail is easy but involves some inclines and steps."

Contemporary art should stay in the contemporary museum in my opinion where it's setting alings with other pieces. This mishmash was really saddening."

The palace itself is elegant, but the real highlight is the Mirabell Gardens — beautifully maintained with colorful flower beds, sculptures, and fountains that make it feel like you’ve stepped into a fairytale. The view looking through the gardens towards the fortress is breathtaking and perfect for photos.\n\nIt’s free to enter the gardens, and they’re easy to walk through, so it’s a great stop even if you’re short on time. If you visit in spring or summer, the flowers are in full bloom and the atmosphere is magical. Music lovers will also appreciate that some of the “Sound of Music” scenes were filmed here.\n\nHighly recommend visiting in the morning before the crowds arrive — it’s peaceful, romantic, and unforgettable."

Wish the person serving us could do better? He’s absolutely gentleman, don’t get me wrong, but… we ordered asparagus for starters, he should’ve recommended something else without asparagus when we picked our mains? Who likes to have repeated ingredients when we can try them all?\n\nNockerl was fluffy, warm but too sweet. Perhaps it’s just the way this dessert is rather than the way this place prepares it.\n\nI’d still recommend coming here but it’s really expensive… €40 just for baby veal with asparagus…"

The historic setting alone is worth the visit, but the food truly elevates it to another level.\n\nWe started with a silky soup that was subtly seasoned and comforting. The green risotto with parmesan crisps and poached cheese was not only visually stunning but also incredibly flavorful with a perfect creamy texture. For the main course, the duck breast was beautifully seared, served over a rich grain base with perfectly cooked vegetables. And finally, the crème brûlée with sorbet was the ideal ending-light, refreshing, and perfectly balanced.\n\nEverything from the service to the atmosphere was top-tier. You really feel the weight of history in the room while enjoying food that's modern, creative, and expertly prepared.\n\nHighly recommended for a special evening in Salzburg 🖤🖤🖤"

It is carved out of rock with beautiful stone columns. The ambience is warm and inviting with lamp light, and greenery annd incredible artwork. The food is amazing. The service was perfect. Alessandro took exquisite care of us. He was attentive and made incredible suggestions. We started with the Tiger prawn tartare with smoked caviar, which was delicate and amazing. The gazpacho soup was fresh and flavorful. We had the duck which was served in a fois gras sauce with Lingonberry jam toast, which all blended perfectly and melted in your mouth. The frozen nougat dessert with fresh berries was incredible and unique. The coffee was rich in flavorful, served in warm, Demitasse cups. We ended with some apricot Austrian brandy. What a fabulous night to remember!  Highly recommend!!!"

The zoo utilizes the natural rocky terrain in an interesting way."

The inn forgoes all the new-fangled food trends in favor of good old-fashioned, gut-busting dishes like Bierbraten (beer roast) with lashings of dumplings and sauerkraut, beef goulash and Kasnocken (mini cheese dumplings with fried onions).",

The pork ribs were very dry, tough, and had a strong porky smell — not juicy at all, and I think they were overcooked. The schnitzel was average, and the rice that came with the dishes was rather tasteless. The fried chicken was not tender; the meat was dry and lacked flavor — honestly, even KFC or simple street-stall fried chicken tastes better.\n\nThe restaurant’s ventilation is also poor, and the smell of cooking oil lingered on our clothes after dining. On top of that, the prices are quite high compared to the quality. Overall, it’s really not worth a visit."

It is covered in locks that couples have left behind as a testament to their devotion and love. The Salzach River and the city skyline may be seen clearly from the bridge.\nThis area of Salzburg is quite charming. Make plans in advance to make a wish and place your love lock on the bridge. It can get very crowded on the bridge. Make an effort to arrive early. If you want to see the charming Salzburg houses and get away from the visitors, you must take a stroll along the river. A well-liked location for talented musicians to showcase their skills."

The ornate baroque tombstones and the cliffside catacombs create a unique and striking atmosphere. Walking through, you can’t help but feel the weight of its history.\n\nInside the nearby church, I lit a candle for a loved one who was very ill. It was a quiet and beautiful moment, made even more special because we used to watch “The Sound of Music” together. Being in a place so connected to the film added a layer of meaning to the experience.\n\nThis spot is serene and reflective, perfect for appreciating Salzburg’s rich past or finding a moment of connection and peace. It’s a visit I’ll always hold close to my heart :)"

The other location is only 5 mins walk and a lift. You can hike up if you're feeling very energetic. Your ticket works for both and I think you can use it up to a week (Double check this at the desk). So you don't have to over-do it. The work was excellent and the museum isn't massive, so you can get a nice, bite-sized chuck of well displayed, good quality modern art in the beautiful city of Salzburg. Well worth a visit!"

The venue presents itself as an inclusive space, mindful of important social issues, and at first, the atmosphere seemed positive. However, the way I was treated by the staff was completely unacceptable.\n\nAfter paying €20 for entry, I was on the dance floor when I made eye contact with a girl who seemed a bit serious. In a totally normal and respectful way, I lightly touched her shoulder and asked if she was okay. Anyone with some clubbing experience knows that interactions like this are part of a normal, social night out.\n\nA few minutes later, as I was moving to another room, two staff members approached me and told me not to touch people, implying that several different people had complained about my behavior. This happened without them talking to me first, without knowing what had actually occurred, and without giving me a chance to explain myself.\n\nI felt discriminated against and humiliated, and my night was completely ruined. I decided to leave after only an hour and a half.\n\nWhat struck me the most was how quickly they judged me. I wonder if I would have been treated the same way if I weren’t a foreigner. I had the clear impression that the staff acted with prejudice, making assumptions about me without any effort to hear my side of the story.\n\nIt’s ironic that a club that claims to be modern and inclusive has such a rigid and unfair approach, passing judgment without dialogue. If inclusion means feeling watched and treated like a problem for a completely respectful interaction, then something is seriously wrong."

When I finished it in 10 seconds (not what I'd prefer to do to finish my evening and leave) and turned to my friends next to me to get us together to leave, a bouncer grabbed my arm and tried to physically drag me off my stool. A five minute warning would have absolutely been on me, I've never had to aggressively tell a bouncer not to touch me to be able to walk out of a bar before, especially while being the one person trying to get my group moving to go. Despite a fun night, I can't recommend ever giving this place your business.\n\nIf you look at recent reviews, seems to have gone downhill quite a bit."

The girl reacted as if she had been seriously harassed and immediately ran away.\n\nWithout even speaking to us or trying to understand what had actually happened, the club staff came over and asked my friend to leave. This is completely unacceptable. While we understand that some people might have personal traumas or social anxiety, it would be more appropriate for them to avoid crowded places where people naturally interact.\n\nAs for the staff, they should have taken the time to listen to both sides instead of making rushed judgments. It felt unfair and discriminatory—whether because we are men or foreigners, we don’t know, but the way we were treated was far from inclusive. Since that we left and we paid 20 euro each of us to stay only 2 hours. We both live abroad and travel frequently, yet this is the first time we have experienced something like this.\n\nVery disappointing."

The veal was perfectly tender, the breading light and crisp without being greasy, and that simple squeeze of lemon brought it all to life. Paired with a warm potato salad and a cold Austrian beer, it was comfort food at its finest. You can tell when a dish has history behind it—and this one tastes like tradition, care, and old-world flavor. Absolutely delicious. A must-try"

              "reviewText": "We enjoyed all parts of our visit to this beautiful cafe which has an amazing atmosphere. I wasn't expecting a high quality as I used to have this feeling that tourist attracting restaurants have a very standard taste. I'm happy to be wrong this time. I really liked the sofas with red cushions, which made us feel comfortable in an atmosphere with a historical importance. The classical music, at a level that didn't hinder our conversation, created a peaceful atmosphere. We really wished to read or study as we enjoyed our coffees. The Sachertorte we had was really fresh and delicious. I was thinking that so much chocolate could make the taste heavy, but it was nice to balance it with the sugar-free cream. I found the coffee Wiener Melange with cream rather delicious even though black coffee is my usual choice with desserts. A detail that I'd like to mention is that it's nice to see some water to be served along with the dessert and coffee, which, in my opinion, indicates that the place shows respect towards the customers. The service was very nice and people were helpful as well. It's definitely worth visiting in Salzburg."

That is brand recognition at its best and maintained over time.  I was lucky enough as a kid that my auntie took me to Cafe Sacher.  Certainly I didn't have much appreciation for the beautiful interior at that time but I recall my fondness of their hot chocolate and slice of chocolate cake\nFast forward, giving this place a new try.  It's like stepping back in time, an epoch of grandness and to this day  time stands still. The lush interior, the spot on service with the just right level of friendliness and efficiency.\nThe coffee with its whipped cream. The chocolate cake, with a hint of nuts, is neither dry nor moist, it's neither sweet nor bland.  This perfect balance, makes this cake so unique.\n\nSit back and let the time roll back and take it all in..  This piece of cake can make the outlook on life so much better, bite by bite."

We stopped in to try the famous Sacher-Torte and a cappuccino. Now, don't get me wrong, you can definitely taste the quality in everything, but honestly? For me, the Sacher-Torte and cappuccino were just... okay. Nothing to really cheer about, and to be perfectly honest, the price was quite exorbitant.\nSo, here's my take: it's worth a visit just to say you've experienced the original Sacher-Torte in its birthplace, soak in that grand atmosphere, and tick it off your Salzburg list. But for the taste and the price, once is probably enough!"

This Sacher-torte slice was quite good, but slightly drier than the one we had and preferred in Wien. I LOVED the Salzburger Nockerl, which by far was the best one I had out of a number of restaurants in Salzburg and left me wishing I could stay longer in the city to go back to Café Sacher and enjoy more times. Servers were kind and careful when it came to food allergies. The café is also beautifully decorated!"

The hot chocolate was also amazing – rich and comforting, just what you need on a cold day.\n\nThe waiters were incredibly friendly and attentive, making sure we had everything we needed. There’s also more than enough space to sit comfortably, so you can really enjoy the experience without feeling crowded.\n\nIf you’re looking for a historic spot with excellent food, drinks, and a unique atmosphere, Café Tomaselli is a must-visit! Highly recommend it for anyone in the area."

Slept well in comfort (caveat - I travel with facemask and earplugs) Room was spacious. The bathroom has a toilet separated with a slide door from the rest of the bathroom rather than an all in one like you can see sometimes. Shower had good pressure and pleasant temperature. We didn't use the balcony much due to the weather but it would be nice in the evening in a warmer evening with a couple of chairs, lounger and shade. The room also had a couple of reading chairs and a desk to offer flexibility and a good size TV in line with the bed.\n\nStaff really have attention to detail, we got some wine from a supermarket when out and left it in the room and they brought us glasses without asking.\n\nThe bath had a jacuzzi option but we didn't use it.\n\nMy only negative thoughts on the room:\n\nI would suggest to the hotel that a bar or non-slip mat might be useful as you're stepping out the bath onto a tiled floor and only have the towel rail on your left or the bath to grab if you do wobble as the only other option is the glass splash protector\n\nOptions on pillows would be useful (maybe a question on booking?) - we didn't ask so maybe it was an option but I like a firm pillow, the 2 provided were pretty soft and floppy\n\nI would like a kettle in the room but the machine downstairs is always available - just means you have to get showered or at least dressed to get any, I prefer to get out of bed and have some coffee before going down.\n\nBreakfast\n\nPlenty of options - bread and bagels, cakes and sweets plus cold meats, cheese etc + fruit, freshly poured smoothie and juice, cereals. We had maybe 20 minutes each day there, taking time and enjoying the food\n\nThere was only one coffee machine but breakfast was never that busy when we were there so wasn't a major issue\n\nMy only complaints were that there was no hot buffet, only the offer of eggs (which I don't like) - some sausage or bacon to be offered, would be something to consider?\n\nHotel is incredibly easy to get to on the bus from the station (160 I think), about 10 stops, free if you get the Salzburg card which I would recommend anyway due to the free access to so many things"

A beautiful double size bathroom with full walk in closet and ice cold air conditioning. Not to mention the property has the most beautiful gardens and color.\n\nAccess to town by foot is easy with the museum elevator to the lower level (free with card provided by hotel). The hotel restaurant food is 10/10.\n\nThis was one of the higher cost hotels we stayed during our honeymoon but we found it was worth the cost 100% compared to the others due to the level of treatment and service. If you plan to splurge on a hotel in Salzburg this is the one you must visit.\n\nCannot wait to come back!"

The room was very spacious and they upgraded us to a bigger suite upon arrival. The pool was nice and was not crowded at all. Our breakfast was included and was great — it had lots of options and the service was quick. The hotel gave us tickets to a lift, which is a 5-10 minute walk from the hotel. The lift will take you to the main shopping / food area in Salzburg. It was super convenient to get around so we only needed an Uber a few times. Would definitely recommend this hotel and would love to go back!!!"

The beds were extremely comfortable.\n\nThe hotel was dog friendly , although we kept our dog in the room for breakfast and dinner upon request which we were happy with.\n\nThe view from our room was spectacular and a lovely way to wake up each day.\n\nThe breakfast was excellent and couldn’t wish for a better start to the morning. There was a wide selection. I believe the dining room has been recently renovated and it was beautiful.\n\nWe ate dinner at the hotel and it was such a very tasty and relaxing experience that we chose to return the following evening for dinner also. We would recommend a price list for daily specials.\n\nWe would love to return to the hotel again in a different season. We imagine it would also be a great experience.\n\nThe bus stop is 2 minutes walk and it is around 15-20 minutes to get to the centre of Salzburg. Around 40 minutes to the HBF with one bus change. We also bought a 24hr bus ticket from the hotel reception.\n\nThe family owners are very friendly. Thank you."

Located in a peaceful, scenic area just outside the city, this charming family-owned guesthouse offered everything we hoped for and more.\n\nThe rooms were clean, spacious, and very comfortable, with beautiful mountain views from the balcony. We loved relaxing by the lovely pool.\n\nA real highlight of our stay was having access to bikes. Riding through the forests and quiet country paths to the palace was one of our favorite activities.\n\nThe breakfasts were fresh and delicious, with a great variety of choices, and the dinner we had was some of the best food we had in Austria.\n\nThe bus stop is just a short walk from the pension, making it very easy to get to the center of Salzburg.\n\nWe were sad to go when our stay ended, and hope to return someday soon."

The room itself was massive, with a nice bathroom and the view from our window was perfect!\n\nThe staff are so friendly, you can pay at reception for daily bus tickets into Salzburg, which was really easy and only took 15 minutes to get into the centre.\n\nBreakfast was delicious and a really good thorough spread with plenty of options for vegetarians too.\n\nThe room was a little hot but it's been exceptionally hot in Austria all week, so not the fault of the hotel.\n\nCan't rate highly enough, will definitely be coming back! ☺️"

The breakfast is the best anywhere and the dinner selections are amazing.\n\nThe availability of easy parking and close proximity of the city bus stop to the property provides stress-free access to Salzburg.\n\nSylvia and the family are delightful and pleasant and know how to do the little things to make the overall experience fulfilling and rewarding.\n\nThey are continuously doing meticulous maintenance to the building and rooms to keep everything looking brand new.  The opening of the outdoor pool really made a few very hot days so much nicer!\n\nWe can't wait to visit again!"

While lacking in certain amenities; sauna, gym, etc, the hotel lends to a bygone era of service and class."

For example, I left my airpods in my room, and the staff offered to ship them back to me in the US, and did so promptly. My 2 young kids were greeted with toys and warm smiles at check in and throughout the stay.  The morning breakfast staff went above and beyond accomodating my little kids and the \"fun\" they had at each meal with no issues of the mess they made and foods they asked for from the kitchen.  We will definitely be back. thank you to the team/staff."

But none have felt like home the way Hotel Goldener Hirsch does.\n\nThe hospitality is exceptional. Warm, attentive and genuine. From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel not just welcomed, but cared for. Our room was beautifully appointed, with a view overlooking the Pferdeschwemme. It was comfortable in that rare way that makes you want to unpack, settle in and stay a while.\nBreakfast service delivered to our room each morning allowed us to ease into the day with quiet and comfort. In the evenings, we found ourselves at the hotel bar both before and after dinner, drawn in by the atmosphere and the incredibly welcoming bartender. I wish I had gotten his name. His professionalism, beautiful cocktails and way of making everyone feel like a regular added a layer of warmth that made those evenings feel special.\n\nI'm going to return. Hotel Goldener Hirsch is more than a luxury property. It’s where we’ll return, again and again, because it feels like coming home."

The combination of aviation, motorsport, and cutting-edge architecture is unlike anything I’ve seen before. The displays — from historic planes to Red Bull’s Formula 1 beasts — are absolutely stunning. You can really feel the passion for speed, precision, and innovation in every corner of the space.\n\nI’ve uploaded some photos I took during my visit — but honestly, they don’t do it justice. You have to experience it in person to really appreciate the scale and atmosphere.\n\nThe best part? Entry is free! There’s also a Michelin-star restaurant and a stylish bar inside, which adds to the overall premium feel of the place.\n\nWhether you’re a motorsport fan, an aviation enthusiast, or just someone who appreciates world-class design — Hangar-7 is a must-see.\n\n10/10 would visit again."

Inside there is a neat exhibition of contemporary artists, which makes the place even more interesting. We visited it early on Thursday, but unfortunately the planes were taking them out of the hangar to participate in flights and we couldn't look at them. Fortunately, the cars and motors were there and we're able to look at them at least. The fan shop is not very big, but you can find your favorite Red Bull item."

The ice cream place near the entrance is also very delicious. And I’d like to mention the best for last in my opinion; the restrooms. PLEASE go visit them, they’re absolutely BEAUTIFUL AND VERY SANITARY. It felt like luxury treatment in there haha! I went to this museum with my father, but I would love to visit this place again with my friends next time I travel to Switzerland! ♥️♥️♥️"

At first, we asked a younger counter staff about how to use the Innsbruck Card and most convenient parking location, but her service attitude and tone were very reluctant.\nAfter gathering information at the center, I tried my luck to another staff member (Kaisu) for consultation. She was very friendly and shared the travel information with me. Additionally, looking at the time, she suggested that we can consider visiting the nearby Goldens Dachl, having lunch and then return to the center before 1pm to join a guided walking tour. After that, walk to the cable car center nearby to go to Nordkettenbahnen.\nThanks to Kaisu's friendly sharing, our family had a perfect day in Innsbruck. If I have the chance to go back again, I must remember to bring a small gift to thank her.\nNoted: The city tour guide on that day was very professional and friendly. Thanks! 🙏"

By the way, it gets extremely cold when the sun's gone even during hot summer days. So, don't forget to bring warm clothes in your backpack if you're planning to stay there longer. FYI: each year there's an event called #bergsonnwend in which they celebrate the longest day (normally it's June 21) on Saturday earlier or afterwards and everybody ignites a bonfire on the top of the mountains. On that day the lastest cable car back to the station of Patscherkofel is at 23.00 pm, so don't be late!"

There were no other passengers at the bag drop counters or security so we got through both in about 5 minutes. I would recommend looking at how many flights are leaving the airport around your flight time because if you’re the only flight for a few hours then it will be a very fast process! The airport has beautiful views of the mountains but there’s only one small duty free store and one small cafe. So you don’t really need to get here 2 hours early if there aren’t other flights at the same time :)"

Luckily it was not raining.  Once in, we were eventually checked in with boarding passed that stated that our flight was late by one hour. We had a quick lunch upstairs, only to realise that perhaps our flight was still trying to depart more or less in time.\n\nSo we hurried to security check, but the staff guided us go upstairs, it would be faster. We went there, but after standing a few minutes in very very slow queue there, we realised that the lines are moving faster downstairs after all. So back down!\n\nFortunately the other passengers were really friendly and let us jump the queue.  We made it thru relatively fast and found that, yes indeed, the gate was already open and the flight was indeed boarding.  So luckily we made it in the end, leaving about 20mins late. Definitely it was one of the most confusing on-boarding experiences for a long time.\n\nLESSON LEARNED - Dont trust what you see on your Boarding Card!"

Small, efficient, and surrounded by breathtaking Alpine scenery, it’s a gateway that already feels like part of the trip.\n\nThe terminal is compact, which makes navigation easy and stress-free. From check-in to security usually takes only a few minutes, far quicker than at major hubs. Staff are friendly and professional, and baggage handling is smooth—even with skis and snowboards during the busy winter season. While queues can get longer at peak holiday times, the atmosphere is still more relaxed than most airports.\n\nFacilities inside are modest but practical. You’ll find cafés, a snack bar, duty-free shopping, and regional souvenirs. Don’t expect endless dining or luxury lounges, but for a short wait before boarding, everything essential is there. Free Wi-Fi works reliably, which is always a plus.\n\nThe real highlight is the flight experience. Approaching or departing Innsbruck is unforgettable, with planes threading through dramatic mountain peaks and valleys. It’s considered one of the most scenic—and challenging—landings in Europe, and pilots are specially trained for these alpine conditions. Winter weather can sometimes cause delays or diversions, but staff usually handle these situations well with clear communication.\n\nGetting to and from the airport is very convenient. The city center is only 15 minutes away by taxi, bus, or rental car. Public transport is reliable and affordable, and car rentals are right at the terminal for those heading to ski resorts or exploring Tyrol.\n\nOverall, Innsbruck Airport is efficient, welcoming, and uniquely beautiful. It may not have the scale of bigger airports, but as a smooth gateway to the Alps, it delivers an experience few others can match."

Like a bad comedy, you will have the same people at check-in, security, and then your gate. We traveled almost every country in the EU over the summer, this was miles apart in terms of how bad it was.\n\nThey confiscate everything at security. France allows 2 liter full bottles, nope not in Austria. Charge for any bags over 8kg, even though the overhead bins support 12kg per bag. €120 for checked bags because we had 10kg carry on. The price of an ENTIRE AIRLINE TICKET to another country.\n\nSafe to say we will never travel to this country again or fly Austrian Air again. Tell me how treating tourist like this will help your economy that is already in recession? Bad management that don't know what they are doing.\n\nIt's a shame a corporation can ruin a county like this, I'd be pissed if I was an Austrian national depending on tourist in their restaurants, taxis, hotels, businesses, ECT.\n\nI'm not the only one. Reddit tells everyone to avoid this country now. Millions in business lost to an already struggling country.\n\nTo top it all off, flight was late, barely got on our connecting flight, and our bags missed the connection that we were forced to check. This meant wearing the same clothes for 48 hours in Hungary."

Not just to the lounge or the airport, but the town itself.\n\nWhen you approach the counter they are smiley and pleasant and eager to welcome you.\n\nFor families with kids they tell you about the almost invisible 'magic door' through which you must pass to access the lounge. So clever and enchanting. What a fun and creative way to add-value to people's journey!\n\nInside, the lounge is nicely designed with big sofas, individual seating, quiet booths for working and big windows revealing gliders and planes taking off and landing.\n\nThe lounge good croissants, jams, yoghurts, coffees and other beverages. There are also monitors so you know when your gate is announced - AND bonus, general boarding announcements can be heard in the lounge.\n\nManuela, would also occasionally pop in to the lounge to clear plates etc. and even made a point of wishing guests a nice flight. When was the last time someone wished you that?\n\nIn short this is a great lounge, managed by two really delightful people who are great ambassadors for Austrian hospitality. They're both worth promoting, rewarding and probably cloning.\n\nIf only more Priority Pass Lounge hosts were as pleasant, playful and professional."

After refreshing myself with a typically good pint of Tirolese beer, I had Ofenleber mit Bratkartoffeln und grünen Salat: really delicious liver dumpling and yummy gravy. My partner had Schweinsbraten mit Sauerkraut und Semmelknödel: tender roast pork made my mouth water and juicy sauerkraut re-stimulated my appetite. What is most remarkable is that the prices were incredibly reasonable. This restaurant is highly recommended. To say in a British fashion, it is a perfect public house (pub)!!"

The burgers had no patty, just a slice of roasted Hokkaido pumpkin, which at best counts as a sandwich then. The bread was also too crispy, so the whole thing became unnecessarily dry and chewy. For ~16-17€, you should also get something in return.\n\nThe trifle is not a trifle. We had some sort of chocolate cream/mousse with a fruit layer on top. For ~8-9€ a total disappointment compared to other places' desserts.\n\nIn addition, the waitress also forgot to bring our drinks (beer and spritz, which is very good), although it wasn't busy anymore after noon. We received them after we reminded her. The water we ordered never came though.\n\nThe place is very nice to be at and has a good vibe. No questions asked. Unfortunately, the food needs way more love."

The staff were wonderfully accommodating, setting the stage for what would be an unforgettable dining experience. Their particular attention to solo diners like myself made the evening even more enjoyable, creating a welcoming and friendly atmosphere.\n\nThe food at Lichtblick is beyond comparison - each dish is not only cooked to perfection but also carries an innovative flair that sets it apart from anything else in the area. The taste is memorable, a testament to the creativity and skill that goes into each plate.\n\nBut the experience isn’t limited to the palate alone. The stunning views from the restaurant add a visual delight to the entire affair. Paired with the gentle background music that encourages contemplation without being intrusive, the ambiance is nothing short of perfect.\n\nHowever, the only slight drawback was the limited options for wine by the glass. More variety here would further elevate the dining experience.\n\nIn conclusion, Restaurant Lichtblick offers an unparalleled dining experience with its welcoming staff, innovative menu, and breathtaking views. It’s an absolute must-visit for anyone seeking a memorable meal."

However, i did not enjoy the hot chocolate.\n\nIf you’re a fan of rich hot chocolate that resembles molten chocolate - thick and rich and tastes like melted chocolate with some milk/cream, then the hot chocolate from here isnt for you!\n\nThe hot chocolate from here tastes more like milo + milk. Or cocoa powder with milk and sugar rather than melted chocolate in milk. Kind of like swissmiss made with cream/whipped cream. The taste of milk and sugar is more overpowering than that of chocolate. So if you’re someone who doesnt like dark chocolate or hot chocolate that is too rich, this will be up your alley!"

We ordered a \"käse (cheese) sandwich\" and what we received was a dry semmel (maybe a few days old) with some slices of edamer cheese, nothing else. For €9!!!! The pricing for such a low level \"meal\" is ridiculous. The behaviour of the waiter was also very strange, he was not rude, but not nice either and was acting weird when communicating with customers. Lastly, it's 2025, and we're in the middle of a tourist hotspot and they are accepting cash only. So overall I see no reason to go there when the price-to-performance ratio is that terrible. However, credit where credit is due, the ice cream cups were nice but cost around 13 euro, so not exactly cheap either. There are so many nice places around Innsbruck, where you will get your money's worth. Here spent €60 (2 people) and left disappointed and hungry."

When you book tickets for other people using the Flixbus app, their names are saved under your profile — without any clear warning. The next time you book a ticket, the app automatically defaults to those previously saved names unless you manually change them.\n\nIf you don’t catch this (which is easy to miss), your new ticket ends up booked under someone else’s name. That’s exactly what happened to me — and to make things worse, Flixbus charges 18 euros per ticket for a name change. No exceptions, no flexibility.\n\nThis feels intentionally designed to trick users into making a simple mistake and then penalize them for it. There’s no obvious prompt to double-check passenger names, and no safeguard in place to alert you if you’re about to book under the wrong one. The whole process feels like a deliberate cash grab.\n\nIt’s not just bad UX — it’s dishonest business practice. Be extremely careful when booking, and consider whether you want to support a company that operates this way."

Many also like to take the famous Schlossberg cable car or the elevator to enjoy the probably most spectacular view of Graz.",

This beautiful clock tower & surrounding garden area offers the best views of the city.\n\nIt’s definitely a hike to get up here, as it is a viewing area and one of the hugest points in the city. So you can get some good exercise and then be rewarded with a beautiful sight of Graz’s cityscape.\n\nThere’s a lot to walk around and see up here, beyond the clock tower. The gorgeous flower gardens are right below, there’s multiple viewing decks around the top, plenty of benches and places to sit and enjoy the quiet, a museum, a city citytop restaurant, and even a performing theater. Depending on the day and events happening, you could definitely spend an entire day up here doing a variety of activities.\n\nMuch love, Graz."

There’s an amazing staircase carved right into the hillside that makes you feel like you’re conquering the mountain step by step. But if stairs aren’t your thing, don’t worry: there’s also a funicular and even an elevator to take you to the top.\n\nI highly recommend the funicular.  It’s smooth, quick, and the views as you ascend are fantastic. Plus, it’s part of Graz’s regular public transport system, so the cost is the same as a bus or tram ride. You can buy a one-way ticket, use your 24-hour pass, or even a weekly/monthly pass. Just note: if you’re using a transit ticket, you’ll need to stop at the ticket window to get waved through instead of scanning at the turnstile.\n\nAt the top, you’ll be rewarded with incredible panoramic views of the city. Between the history, the scenery, and the multiple ways up and down, it’s the kind of spot you can’t miss when exploring Graz. Whether you’re climbing, riding, or snapping photos from above, the Schlossberg is one of those places that makes the city feel truly special."

The museum's cutting-edge exhibitions showcase the city's modernity and future-oriented approach, contrasting with the historical landmarks nearby. This unique coexistence of old and new architecture adds to Graz's multifaceted character.",

The closer I got to the main facade, the more I was reassured in my belief that the interior would be just as captivating. It's a museum with a very modern layout, and also with a groundbreaking proposal. It has one of the best museum shops I've ever visited, followed by a powerful sensory section, like the video of Marina Abramović screaming until she's utterly exhausted from the effort.\n\nThere is a section dedicated to referencing Guernica and its political dimension, detailing its journey around the world, alongside some original newspaper clippings that tell stories about the painting. Moreover, the museum's rooms are spacious and dark, with skylights (clarabollas) that let the light through in a very particular way.\n\nIt’s a stunning place, well worth the visit, and I would rate it 5 stars without hesitation!"

I couldn't shake the feeling that I was on a spaceship.\nThis museum doesn't showcase art in the classical sense, but it offers something else.\nHere, art is meant to be listened to, felt, and perhaps understood in your own way.\nSome exhibits made no sense to me at all, even after reading the explanations — and that was part of the intrigue.\nThe price is standard for Austria. The staff is excellent. The shop inside is interesting.\nI definitely recommend a visit."

It took us around 1.5 hours to learn about everything, including a photography exhibition. This place has 3 floors for exhibitions - there was also a \"friendly alien\" space below seemingly targeted for children; interactive stuff, where saw a work from someone and I loved it!"

Awesome architecture on the outside, awesome light shows on the building during the night, massive concrete building.\n\nThey have lockers at -1 like most Austrian art galleries and museums and you are not allowed to bring your backpack inside the museum, nor selfie sticks, not liquids.\n\nI especially love the eye shaped windows at the first flor, gave such alien UFO vibes or a feeling you were i side a cyborg wale or something 😄🐳🐋.\n\nOn the last floor there is an indoor terrace with a view towards the river and the city center.\n\nThey have great restrooms for people with disabilities as well and lifts between the floors.\n\nThey also have a bar terrace outside , behind the museum, very lively and there is also a municipality fountain , with drinkable water, next to that bar , for those hot summer days .\n\nArtworks were very well lit and separated with proper details in regard to the artist and hi/her work."

              "reviewText": "The Ambition and Illusion exhibit was extremely informative! I learnt so much about the Eggenberg family’s rise and fall!\n\nIt starts by showing off the wealth and importance of the Eggenberg family, showing the Golden Coach which was the highlight of Johan Anton Von Eggenberg entrance into Rome.\n\nThe exhibit goes on to explain how the Eggenberg family rose and fell in 5 generations. Starting from Hans Ulrich who was the advisor of the Holy Roman Empire, to the last heir. I really loved how well planned the story telling was! It was really engaging. You get to learn about how Han Ulrich slowly rose to power, how he loved his wife and died of an illness. Followed by the short life of Johann Anton and subsequently the lives of his two sons and his daughter.\n\nI was really moved by Anna Maria’s (Johann Anton’s wife) life. She was of protestant faith but she married Johann Anton who hoped that the marriage would prove strategic and useful given the unrest between the Catholics and Protestants. When Johann Anton died young, she was left to teach her sons a faith she wasnt familiar with. She also lived like an outsider because of her faith.\n\nIt was also interesting to see the different personalities of each generation. Overall super educational! And as you can see, the information is easy to retain because of good storytelling.\n\nThere are also rooms with lots of amazing paintings on walls and the ceiling, and explanations on the allegories. So much to take in! The only downside is that the exhibit banners cover a lot of the palace walls, so there are only selected rooms where you get to see the palace rooms as is!"

From the moment I stepped into the grounds, I was greeted by an expansive, exquisitely maintained garden surrounded by majestic trees, creating a serene and picturesque setting that set the tone for the entire experience.\n\nExploring the historical museum within the palace was a journey through time, as I encountered a remarkable collection of ancient artifacts, including Roman utensils, rocks, and even mummies. The museum's displays provided a fascinating insight into history, offering a captivating glimpse into ancient civilizations.\n\nThe option of guided tours in both German and English was a thoughtful inclusion, allowing visitors to immerse themselves in the history of the palace and its precious exhibits. The guided tour enhanced my understanding of the palace's heritage, making the visit even more fulfilling.\n\nYet, the true highlight of the visit was the presence of the charming and engaging dancing peacocks that gracefully roamed the palace grounds. Their delightful displays, complete with their vibrant and captivating feathers, added an extra layer of magic to the entire visit, creating an unforgettable and unique experience.\n\nOverall, this palace seamlessly combines natural beauty, rich history, and captivating attractions, making it a standout destination for anyone seeking a truly enchanting experience. I left with a deep appreciation for the history and beauty that this palace has to offer."

This experience was wonderful, I watched “La Traviata” and everything from the orchestra to the acting and production was unforgettable, would recommend to anyone who gets the opportunity to go 😊"

Entering the mausoleum you immediately dive into a cozy respectful atmosphere conveying the greatness of a Duke family. The cathedral has been recently restored, the pictures of the cathedral show how it looked before and after the renovation.\nGOOD TO KNOW: Free of charge. Put one euro if you want to light a candle there. Open on Saturdays. ♥️"

Set beneath high vaulted Renaissance arches, the dining room emanates a harmonious blend of warmth and elegance—a place where cozy booths, ambient lighting, and mellow laughter invite you to linger.\n\nThough the complete menu remains discreet, I savored a flawlessly crisp Wiener Schnitzel, tender veal, and a refined steak, each dish showcasing the integrity of regional ingredients. Dessert—the comforting apple strudel and indulgent crème brûlée—offered a perfect, sweet punctuation to the meal. The bar, dubbed \"Katze Katze,\" adds a playful, imaginative twist, making each visit feel both elegant and intimate.\n\nService felt heartfelt and polished; staff made me feel genuinely welcome, and every detail—from the dish presentation to the wine recommendation—demonstrated thoughtful care. Landhauskeller isn’t just a meal—it’s an invitation to experience Styrian hospitality at its finest, wrapped in historic charm and culinary sincerity. A truly memorable stop in Graz."

There was so much energy as I arrived in town, eager to indulge in authentic Austrian cuisine.\n\nThe restaurant I visited is situated next to an old heritage house, and dining outdoors was especially enjoyable with the cool night breeze. The menu featured authentic Austrian dishes, and we started with a variety of appetizers: slow-cooked pork neck, lamb salad, beef broth, and beef tartare. Each dish was outstanding.\n\nFor the main course, I had the charred fillet with truffle spaghetti and sautéed zucchini and tomatoes. The fillet was perfectly cooked, with a charred exterior and moist interior. Most of my colleagues opted for beef dishes, which they also found excellent. Overall, it was a fantastic place to relax with a few glasses of wine."

              "reviewText": "♐️ I did a short research about The Clock Tower (Uhrturm) in Graz, Austria\n\n1. Location:\nThe tower is located on Schlossberg Hill, a central and historic hill in the heart of Graz. It offers one of the best panoramic views of the city.\n\n2. History:\n•\tThe Clock Tower dates back to the 13th century, although its current appearance is from the 16th century after renovations.\n•\tIt is one of the oldest landmarks in Graz still standing today.\n\n3. Unique Features:\n•\tOne curious feature: the clock hands are reversed from the usual design.\n•\tThe larger hand shows the hours, and the smaller one shows the minutes.\n•\tThis is because originally the clock only displayed hours, and the minute hand was added later.\n•\tThe clock face is large and highly visible, making it a recognizable symbol across the city.\n\n4. Current Use:\n•\tWhile it’s no longer used as a watchtower, the Clock Tower is now a beloved symbol of Graz and a top tourist attraction.\n•\tVisitors can access it by walking up the Schlossberg stairs, taking a funicular, or using a glass elevator inside the hill.\n\n5. Cultural Significance:\n•\tThe Uhrturm is an icon of Graz’s identity.\n•\tIt’s often featured on souvenirs, city logos, and is beautifully lit up at night.\n\nVery beautiful to visit specially in sunset time ✨"

The Clock Tower carefully watches over the city, as you get a splendid panoramic 360° view of the city.\n\nYou have a few options to chose from on how to get to it, but I highly recommend taking the funicular as it's the most scenic route. Apart from that, if you're up to it, taking a hike on the many stairs is another option.\n\nThe photos don't do it justice, you have to visit this landmark for yourself and learn the history of this place."

Me and my friends tasted each other dish, and there was not a dish that I didn’t like.\nThe service was slightly slow, but I guess that was due to the high number of costumers in the restaurant.\n\nOnly one thing didn’t work. My friend ordered a sandwich and he specifically said without onion, but unfortunately it arrived with it. So he had to remove it by himself.

My wife tried the Pablo Picasso breakfast; while it was well-prepared, it just wasn’t quite to her taste.\n\nThe atmosphere was also a highlight—pleasant, relaxed, and a great setting to enjoy a slow morning.

Built in the late 15th century during the reign of Emperor Maximilian I, this architectural marvel is not just a staircase—it’s a symbol of Gothic craftsmanship and a clever illusion of symmetry and unity.\nThe design features two intertwined spiral staircases that ascend together, separating and rejoining at intervals. It’s a bit like a stone dance—poetic, mesmerizing, and surprisingly intimate. Walking up or down, you’ll occasionally cross paths with those on the other stair, giving it the nickname \"The Stairs of Reconciliation.\"\nAlthough it’s a short visit (you’ll only need about 15-20 minutes), it’s absolutely worth seeing, especially if you appreciate historical architecture or hidden details. There’s no grand entryway or elaborate signage—part of the charm is how quietly it stands, waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe entry is free and usually accessible during regular hours. A must-see for anyone who enjoys history, design, or simply uncovering the soul of a city beyond the main tourist paths."

Loved every second spent here!\nThe main greenhouse is designed beautifully, it's like you've entered a fairytale. I especially loved the bridges. You might want to take a couple of photos here, it's magical!\nBe ready to spend more than two hours here, it's worth it.\nAlso, there is a little aquarium in one of the greenhouses.\nThe entrance is free, no ticket is needed. You can donate whatever amount you want to."

The museum gets you to think about how things were like. There was a real wealth of information - we spent 1hour and think it's not enough despite it being a small museum. Student tickets available. Only suggestion is to give more context to what they have written and tell it more like a story. And also there was nothing on colonialism besides something on chickens in ghana. Even the holocaust was only very briefly touched upon. There are english descriptions which we appreciated."

Howevere, many of the items displayed have a story behind them. The pearls are the \"smoke room\", a wooden bicycle and replicas of historic clothes. It takes 1 - 2 hours to experience the museum properly. It's surely worth of a visit."

We got inside and visited different rooms as we have different interests and pace. The entrance ticket was kept all along in my pocket. When the guard asked my wife to show her ticket, she explained to him that the ticket is with her husband. The guard dismissed that and asked her to leave. She felt very upset about this though she was able to stay since I had just passed by the door without noticing what was happening. I was later told about the whole story, though. 2) Most of the displayed information (permanent collection) is in German with no English translation. To us, the experience in this museum was very unpleasant. Our advice is don't waste your money and time in this museum."

It’s full of history and atmosphere, surrounded by beautifully preserved medieval buildings that make you feel like you've stepped into another century. The architecture is stunning from every angle, especially if you take time to look up at the details on the facades.\n\nThe square has a lively but relaxed vibe, with cafes, street performers, and people just sitting around enjoying the moment. Right in the middle, there’s a striking bronze statue that at first glance feels traditional, but if you look closely, it has this unexpected punk element—like a subtle twist that adds humor to the history around it. It really makes the whole place feel unique.\n\nIt’s a great spot to start exploring Graz—everything important seems to branch out from here. Whether you’re into photography, architecture, or just people-watching with a coffee, this square has something for you. I ended up spending more time here than I expected, just taking in the energy. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the city.\nLove From India ❤️"

The funicular is modern and quick, taking only two minutes to go up or down.\n\nThe price is also very cheap and we had the whole vehicle to ourselves. Compared to other funiculars in Europe, this one is perfect. The staff was also very polite."

Open, airy, and welcoming, the café floods with natural light, inviting you to explore its colorful, self-service buffet island—from crisp, seasonal salads to thoughtfully prepared warm dishes, all made with conscious care and priced by weight.\n\nI delighted in mixing and matching a plate of beautifully fresh salads, hearty mains, and a fragrant soup—each bite felt honest and thoughtfully composed. Later, the pastry counter captured my heart: vegan cakes and tarts so luscious and delicious, each slice a testament to their in-house bakery’s gentle care and artisan craft. The minimalist décor and friendly staff only added to the cozy yet modern vibe.\n\nTrue, the price-per-gram approach means your experience is as personal as your plate—but seeing how lovingly each dish is prepared, it’s a small price for such mindful indulgence. Ginko isn’t just a meal—it’s a celebration of vegan cuisine done with soul, style, and sincerity. A must-visit in Graz for conscious diners and anyone craving food that feels both good and great."

Kids & dogs welcome.\nGinko is an all-vegan buffet-organized restaurant, most of the dishes are gluten free.\nThey have a broad range of cold and warm dishes one can choose from. The different salads and main courses cover eastern-mediteranean/Levante, adriatic-mediteranean as well as Austrian home cuisine and include, for example, oven roasted veggies, quinoa, dahls and curries or stews such as ratatouille.\nThe menu varies daily, all dishes are prepared on site and produce is sourced locally and of organic quality.\nThe prize is by weight of the plate, in general it is on the higher side, but worth every penny!\nI highly recommend this place."

I had the scrambled eggs with pumpkin seed oil and fresh bread. The bread was crispy and warmed up and the portion was bigger than I expected for the price (also, you can pay with card there)! The employees were delightful and energetic :) I honestly can’t find anything bad to write about this place. Come here for great atmosphere and food."

The palace itself is stunning, with intricate interiors and elegant layouts that make wandering through its halls a visual delight. Even with parts of the building under restoration, the charm and grandeur of the palace remain impressive.\n\nThe exhibition, however, is less remarkable. While it has its moments, it doesn’t quite match the awe-inspiring atmosphere created by the palace and its architecture. Art lovers may enjoy it, but for those primarily seeking a “wow” factor, it may feel underwhelming.\n\nA practical note: the queues can be long, especially on weekends. Even if you buy tickets online, you may have to wait for a later slot; when we arrived, our online tickets only allowed entry three hours later. Planning ahead and booking well in advance is highly recommended.\n\nThe gardens are fantastic and free to explore. Locals often jog, run, or just relax there, and it's lovely to see artists drawing or people chilling. Overall, the views and grounds make it worth avisit!\n\nOverall, Belvedere Palace is worth visiting for its architecture and historical appeal, but don’t set your expectations too high for the exhibitions."

Where it really shines though is the inside. The art collection is absolutely incredible and is something you should not miss in Vienna. It is so amazing to come here and admire works of art and to learn about the history of that art, and the artists behind it. The kiss is the main draw of the Belvedere for many, it is much more beautiful in person than what you would expect. I would definitely recommend buying tickets in advance and coming in the morning is the way to go here because of the crowds."

We mainly went there to see Gustav Klimt’s famous painting “The Kiss”. It was very nice to see it in person after all the years of seeing pictures of it. The details of the art is wonderful. Definitely worth a quick visit. I would recommend getting the tickets ahead of time and planning. Make a whole lot of difference."

The Marble hall is impressive, offering breathtaking views of the palace garden.\nMany people come here for Klimt, but it offers so much more to see. The medieval gallery is small and very interesting. I would definitely suggest checking it out.\nBuying tickets in advance is a good idea, as when you come without the tickets you might need to wait for couple of hours to be able to enter the palace. If that happens, go for a walk in the palace garden. Beautiful."

The level of detail here is incredible – every corner feels like a work of art, from the ornate ceilings to the grand staircases.\n\nThe performance was equally stunning. The orchestra and opera singers were on another level – so powerful and moving that even though I’m not usually into classical music, I loved every minute of it. This was truly an unforgettable experience and one of those bucket-list items you absolutely have to check off when visiting Vienna."

They separated families, unlike in the USA, Canada and almost anywhere, where people will switch out individuals if they have fixed people to tour, here, they don't understand and sounded rude.\n\nThe Opera is a historical early modern place of networking and pompous and continues today, and also, it is maybe the most inefficient way of doing stages and keep the jobs.\n\nThat said, enjoyed the seeing The Opera, our tour guide was excellent,most importantly 30 second seating at the biggest and the best, king's box."

I had made a point to dress up, dropping off my tourist garb in the cloak room, but many did not. The opera I attended was sold out so I was lucky to get standing tickets in the Stehparterre section, which still offered good views. It was a mesmerizing evening where I enjoyed music masterpieces, angelic voices, while surrounded by rich Viennese history. It took some planning to score tickets but it was a worthwhile endeavor for me."

The Danube Tower is to the side of a large area of structured park which is on the other side of the river to the main city centre - we reached it on the Metro, followed by a 10-15 min walk, but it was worth it. The lift up to the observation deck had a glass roof, so you good watch the ascent and the view from the deck was great - if a little windy!!!  We then visited the cafe for a drink or two to watch the scenery, before eating at the revolving restaurant on the floor above. We really enjoyed the experience and the view and it was worth the effort to get there. Recommended."

It was cloudy and dramatic at first, then later, it poured.\n\nWe took a peaceful walk through Donaupark on the way in, beautifully green, calm, and spacious. Then came the real highlight: the view from the top of the tower. As the storm rolled in, we watched the clouds and lights shift across the city skyline. One local even told us he had never seen such heavy rain in Vienna before, which made the moment feel surreal and almost cinematic.\n\nThe kids absolutely loved the slide and went on it twice. I worked up the courage to try it too, after a little fear moment that lasted a good 3 to 5 minutes 😅. The staff member at the slide was incredibly kind and patient with both the kids and with me.\n\nWe didn’t dine at the restaurant as the storm got stronger, we felt it was safer to head back to the hotel. While the person checking tickets could have been a bit more welcoming, everything else was smooth and enjoyable.\n\nThe only downside was the toilets. They were not clean and had a strong unpleasant smell definitely an area that needs more attention.\n\nThis spot is still perfect for families, a beautiful mix of nature and city views all in one place. Definitely a must visit when you’re in Vienna."

There was no queue, so you could go up straight away. The elevator has a mirrored ceiling, so it was clear as we went up. The view of the city was magical.

Also beautiful place to click a photo or two.\n\nAs the garden is so huge I saw some people there for their morning stroll. Hey Perplexity, rewrite it and adjust the tone and grammatical errors.\n\nThe palace is truly stunning. Access to the museums inside and certain sections of the garden requires a ticket, but without purchasing one, it’s still possible to visit the garden area behind the palace.

If you like to listen to everything then this will take a significant amount of time. If you want to quickly look around, read few things and stroll around, it will take an hour or so. Be sure to get into the palace itself by 11am otherwise it can get crowded. I would recommend seeing the gardens and park behind the castle first thing in the morning and then follow it with the castle tour inside. I would highly recommend purchasing the ticket ahead of time. You will not be able to take in your backpack but they have a safe area to store them. The palace is located near the station so it is an easy walk. If you are elderly then it might be difficult to walk to and around the whole castle grounds. This palace is worth the visit."

The Baroque architecture is absolutely magnificent, and the grounds are just as impressive. The massive garden stretches behind the palace with the Gloriette perched on the hill, offering one of the best views in Vienna. My tip – start your visit at the Gloriette first and snap some photos of the entire palace and gardens from the balcony. Then, take a leisurely stroll down the hill, through the fountains and perfectly manicured paths, and make your way to the palace entrance.\n\nThe inside tour requires a ticket, but it’s worth every euro. The lavish interiors and rich history give you a true appreciation of the opulent lifestyle of the royal family. We were in awe of the intricate details and grandeur of each room – it really transports you back in time. For even more context, check out the Netflix series The Empress before or after your visit – it adds another layer of appreciation. A must-do when in Vienna!"

The interior is gorgeous with lots to see. You could spend all day in the gardens alone. The hedge maze alone takes about 45 minutes! The zoo is also here, and a playground for kids."

Entry to the main part is free, though some side sections require a small fee.\nI highly recommend climbing to the top — it costs €6.50 and involves 343 steps. It may sound like a challenge, but it’s not as hard as it seems, and it’s totally worth it! The views over Vienna from the top are spectacular. There's also a small souvenir shop up there, which adds a nice touch to the experience.\n\nThere is an elevator on the other side if you prefer that, but many say the staircase side offers better views (I didn’t try the elevator myself). Plus, climbing up and down is a fun little workout.\n\nSuper recommended — a must-do in Vienna!"

With its towering Gothic spire and colorful tiled roof, it stands as a stunning symbol of the city’s heritage.\n\nThe south tower, rising 136 meters, offers breathtaking views of Vienna for those who climb its 343 steps. The cathedral’s roof, made of over 230,000 glazed tiles arranged in striking mosaics, is a visual highlight and an engineering feat.\n\nInside, the mix of Gothic, Romanesque, and Baroque styles reflects its long and layered history. From vaulted ceilings to intricate altars, the interior inspires awe. The catacombs below offer a haunting yet fascinating look into Vienna’s past.\n\nSt. Stephen’s is more than a monument — it’s an active place of worship and a witness to Austria’s key historical moments. It survived World War II bombings and became a symbol of Vienna’s resilience and cultural pride.\n\nWhether you're admiring its facade, exploring its interior, or attending a concert, St. Stephen’s Cathedral is a must-visit landmark that captures the essence of Vienna."

On one side, you’ll find a peaceful and charming green area with a pond full of ducks, perfect for a relaxing walk, biking, or even a picnic under the trees. It's an ideal spot to unwind, enjoy nature, or just let the kids run free while you sit back and take in the serene atmosphere.\n\nOn the other side of the park is a huge amusement area that’s packed with games and attractions for all ages. From thrilling rides to fun games for kids, there's something here for everyone. We tried the giant Ferris wheel, which gave us amazing views — definitely a highlight! The ride cost €6 per person, and it was well worth it. Keep in mind that while entry to the general park is free, each amusement game or ride has its own separate fee.\n\nThere’s also a fantastic section within the park filled with restaurants! you can visit day or night. It’s a great area to relax after a walk or a fun ride, and it's equally enjoyable for both adults and kids.\n\nAll in all, this park is a must-visit. Whether you're looking for a calm afternoon in nature or an exciting day of fun, it has it all in one place!"

The atmosphere alone makes it worth a visit. There are tons of rides and amusement games, from family-friendly options to seriously thrilling ones.\n\nI only managed to try the Ferris wheel. The ride goes for three rounds, and the view at the top is beautiful, but honestly, I’d recommend going for the newer Ferris wheel instead—it feels like the better option. I didn’t get to play the games, but walking around, you can tell it’d be a really fun spot if you had the time.\n\nOne thing to note: most rides and games are individually priced. This works if you know exactly what you want to try, but if you’re hoping to experience everything, it might add up quickly. I didn’t come across a proper “all-access” pass, though maybe one exists. Still, it’s an exciting place to wander, soak in the vibes, and jump on a few rides that catch your eyes."

The trail takes around 3 to 4 hours, so I highly recommend bringing water, wearing comfortable clothes, and good walking shoes, especially since some paths are uphill.\n\nHighlights include the giant pandas, the tropical house, and the aquarium. It’s a perfect place for a day out, and being located next to Schönbrunn Palace makes it easy to combine both attractions. Highly recommended!"

Vienna zoo is known as one of the best in Europe and also worldwide and it is true. We had very good time and spent more than 5 hours walking around and exploring. It is a must visit if you plan a trip to Vienna!!!"

              "reviewText": "Schönbrunn Zoo is a fantastic place — one of the oldest in Europe and truly worth a visit. I really appreciated the clearly marked path that guides you through the zoo in about 2–3 hours. Just make sure to grab a map at the entrance, or you might get a bit lost. The zoo isn’t overwhelming in size, and beyond the fascinating animal exhibits, the architectural layout is also quite interesting.\n\nA highlight for me was the treetop walk, built around a former bomb crater from WWII. It’s now fully overgrown and serves as a peaceful space where you can observe local urban wildlife like birds and small mammals. Despite visiting on a hot weekend, it was still possible to avoid crowds and enjoy the visit comfortably.\n\nThe penguins were a real show — especially since you can watch them walk and swim up close through glass walls. There are several species, from emperor penguins to smaller ones. The polar bear was also a standout — a rare sight in European zoos, and this one was especially active and engaging.\n\nThere are lots of family-friendly attractions, like a ground-level tunnel to watch small mammals like ground squirrels from their eye level. We didn’t see many monkeys, but overall, the experience was great.\n\nTickets are on the pricey side, but it’s worth spending a day here. You can bring your own food and enjoy a picnic at one of the tables, avoiding the expensive food stands. On hot days, it’s also good to know there are many water refill stations around. Highly recommended!"

Recommend for family’s to spend time with, but be prepared for walking since the trail can take up to 4 hours, so don’t take people who don’t like to walk, if you want to see the whole park.😂😉 As all amusement parks and zoos the food and drinks are a bit pricier than outside the park. Overall I recommend seeing this zoo!"

The cabins are big and spacious and they don't stuff them full of people so there's plenty of room to move around and get a good view as it goes around. You'll be able to take some great pictures of Vienna and the panoramic view is spectacular. It was a windy day so there were some points where the cabin swung back and forth which may be scary for some people. If you're afraid of heights it's probably not the best choice but for everyone else it'll probably be worth it. The price is €14.50 for a single ticket."

You ride within large cars that are all enclosed where you can sit or walk around sharing the different views with other riders.  It’s quiet, smooth, solid and feels very safe.  Highly recommend this experience.  Easily purchased my ticket at the ticket desk inside the building below behind the restaurant (a cool dry Saturday evening in May.)  During the summer it might be better to buy online to avoid a long wait. Before going up you get to see a beautiful one-room display of very artfully made models of the park and its history. You can walk through as fast or as slow as you desire."

Before, it appeared to be small but cozy, and only after the recent refurbishment, more rooms can be opened to the public, thanks to the beautiful work from the architect.\n\nI very much disagree with many of the negative comments complaining the place is nearly empty - it is indeed true that not many original belongings are left to show, but this is NOT because the museum does not want to, it is because they are not there anymore.\n\nIn June 1938, Freud and his family left for London due to the National Socialism situation in Germany/Austria, taking as much as they can. As a consequence, when Freud died later, his London house was turned to a museum too.\nHaving said these, it is in principle perfect if one can visit both, first the one in Vienna then in London, also to experience the progression in history.\n\nBut this cannot be a reason to give low reviews to the one in Vienna.\n\nAnd if you think about it, Berggasse 19 is the place where Freud wrote all his famous book, saw nearly all his patients, and the place where magic had happened. This place can be more intense, if you value the space, the moment, even though it appeared empty.\n\nThat said, it is appreciated that not everyone visits here has this level of background knowledge, but the museum has done their job to state that there is the London one for those who are more keen to see these personal/historical items."

From the service to the food to the overall atmosphere, everything was spot on. Even though the place was packed and we didn’t have a reservation, they still managed to give us a second-row seat with a great view. The table was super comfortable and spacious, which made the experience even better. Special thanks to Phelix, both waiter and chef, who was always smiling, welcoming, and made us feel right at home. The only downside was the dessert, which didn’t match the quality of the rest of the meal. Still, highly recommended!"

Was not a problem to get a table next to window as we asked for. The waiter was very good and helped to make some choices between the options we had for food. Also he recommended a good local white wine for our fish. What I appreciated ( and I recommend people traveling from other countries or continents to do - verify where you travel and what is the local food and people culture ) was the focus on client wellbeing . Example: food takes time to be served ( thanks good is cocked and not microwaved ) and the waiter asked us if we are ready for main dish or we want to wait a little and enjoy view and discussion.\nRegarding the food - is a real gastronomic restaurant , I enjoyed the fish and chips revisited and the gazpacho as starter. If you are not in rush, if you understand the restaurant is an experience and not a need to eat, if you accept the local “cold” people style then go here and enjoy the view of Danube Channel.\nOne mention - they have bar, terrace and restaurant - my dinner was in the restaurant."

The palace features beautifully preserved Baroque architecture, and the interiors are quite elegant. Highlights include the Marble Hall, the Golden Room, and the Hall of Grotesques, each with intricate designs and a rich history. The palace also hosts special exhibitions, adding a bit of variety to the visit. The surrounding gardens are peaceful and perfect for a stroll. While it may not have the extensive collection of its bigger sibling, it's definitely a worthwhile stop for anyone interested in Austrian art and Baroque architecture. Overall, a solid four-star experience!"

              "reviewText": "Although it's smaller than the Upper Belvedere, my visit was incredibly rewarding and fulfilling. There was a special exhibition centered around the works of Gustav Klimt and Egon Schiele, which exceeded all my expectations.\n\nSeeing famous works like Klimt's \"Water Serpents I\" and \"Judith\" up close was a truly moving experience. The exhibition also offered a deep dive into Egon Schiele's artistic world through his various drawings and paintings.\n\nWhat impressed me most was the feeling of these vibrant and revolutionary artworks breathing new life into a historic palace. There was a wonderful sense of the past being re-energized and revitalized, which I found truly fantastic.\n\nThe compact size of the exhibition space is actually a plus, as it allows you to appreciate each piece deeply without feeling rushed. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in Viennese Modernism!!"

The huge paintings had been commissioned for the ceiling of the main hall of the University of Vienna, but they were considered pornograhic and grotesque, and Klimt sold them to a private collector instead. In 1945 they were destroyed when retreating nazis set fire to the building they were housed in. Google helped to reconstruct the colours on the basis of old black and white photos.\n\nThe museum itself is much smaller than the Upper Belvedere. There was also a collection of medieval art"

Its tall spire and detailed façade make it one of the most iconic landmarks in Vienna.\n\nWhen I visited, I only saw it from the outside, but it was during the winter season, and the square in front of the City Hall was transformed into an impressive ice skating rink. It wasn’t just any rink—it was large, beautifully set up, and full of lively energy. Definitely a great spot to visit, even if just to enjoy the festive atmosphere around this magnificent building!"

There were so many food and drink stalls offering cuisine from different places. Aperol had its own little corner – their drinks were great too!\nThe area was so lively. We first went during the day and loved it so much that we went back again in the evening to enjoy the atmosphere. It was even more crowded in the evening, with so many people around.

View was amazing, started before sunset and after sunset it only got better!\n\nThe food was outstanding quality from start to finish, I particularly enjoyed the steak! The service was incredible and they couldn't of been nicer! When making my reservation I had to give my date of birth, which they obviously read because to my surprise at the end of my meal they presented me with a little surprise birthday cake!"

              "reviewText": "We made a reservation to celebrate our wedding anniversary and had high expectations for both the food and the overall experience.\n\nOn the positive side, the restaurant is beautiful—stylishly decorated, with very comfortable chairs and amazing views of the city. At night, the rooftop lights create a stunning atmosphere. The service was friendly and attentive, which we really appreciated.\n\nWhen we made the reservation, we were asked if we were celebrating something—I mentioned our anniversary—but unlike someone at a nearby table who got a little birthday cake, we didn’t get anything at all. It’s not that we expected much, but it did feel like we were kind of overlooked. When you’re spending that much on a special night out, it’s a bit disappointing to see others being acknowledged and not you.\n\nWe also chose the wine pairing menu. Some of the wines were delicious, while others weren’t really to our taste. If you enjoy discovering new wines from small producers, it’s a fun experience—the explanations were interesting too. But if you want to be sure you enjoy every glass, you might be better off choosing your own wine.\n\nAs for the food, it was a bit hit-and-miss. The pork belly, the bread and butter, dessert, and the sides were all really good. But the main issue was with the steaks. We ordered one medium rare and one medium well, and although they were served cut in different sizes (which made us think they’d been cooked accordingly), both turned out to be well done. That was disappointing. On top of that, the sauce was overly salty—luckily the creamy gnocchi and cauliflower on the side helped balance it out.\n\nAll in all, it was a nice evening with beautiful views and good service, but I’m not sure I’d go back. For the price, the food didn’t quite live up to expectations."

This practice does not align with the standards of a professional restaurant that claims to be high-end and made the experience unpleasant.

The food is good and they have interesting rotations in their menu each season. Unfortunately, each time we found awful restroom conditions. Considering that this is supposed to be a “higher-end” restaurant and experience, going to wash your hands definitely gives the impression that you are at a public restroom - smell from the top of the stairs, toilet paper on the floor, and I won’t mention more. Incredibly disappointing and a simple way to ruin the overall image of the place."

They didn't tell me otherwise. I was surprised to see they added 7 euros for it on the final bill. When asked, the waiter just brushed it and said it is normal at their restaurant. I have never seen such a thing anywhere else.

Breakfast was tasty, fresh, and beautifully served, but I have to say the portion felt a bit small for the price. Still, the unique atmosphere, the elegant yet relaxed vibe, and the whole experience totally make it worth it. Perfect spot for a cozy morning, weekend brunch, or just coffee in a dreamy setting. Highly recommend if you’re visiting Vienna"

From the outside, the building is pure grandeur—massive columns, elegant statues, and a perfectly balanced neoclassical design that looks like something straight from ancient Greece. The Pallas Athena fountain out front adds even more drama and symbolism to the scene.\n\nBut going inside took it to another level. The interior is elegant, rich in detail, and surprisingly modern in parts after its recent renovation. The mix of historical halls, especially the grand National Council chamber, with sleek new elements like the visitor center and rooftop terrace, makes it feel alive and current—not just a relic of the past."

The atmosphere is magical, especially when it’s not crowded and you can really take in the beauty of all the butterflies fluttering around and the \"jungle\" they live in.\nIt’s not a big place, but that’s part of its charm. I’d definitely recommend going when it’s quieter, so you can feel the true magic of the butterflies up close. It’s one of those spots that leaves you smiling long after you leave! 🥰🦋🌸"

              "reviewText": "I recently visited the Butterfly House in Vienna and overall had a lovely experience. The place is very beautiful, with a nice variety of butterflies fluttering around. However, it did seem like one particular type of butterfly was dominating the space, which was a little underwhelming considering the expectations for more diversity.\n\nThe greenery inside is lush and well-maintained, and the small waterfalls throughout really add to the atmosphere, mimicking a real-life tropical ecosystem beautifully. It’s a very charming and peaceful setting — at least it would be if it wasn’t so crowded. The space itself feels a bit too small for the large number of visitors, which made it harder to fully enjoy the experience.\n\nThe entrance fee is €10, which is reasonable given the uniqueness of the place. It’s also situated in a lovely area surrounded by nice cafés, making it a great spot to plan a day around.\n\nI would recommend expanding the space a bit and introducing more types of butterflies to enhance the experience even further. Overall, I’m giving it four stars — definitely worth a visit if you’re in Vienna, but be prepared for some crowds."

First, we were charged 50 cents each just to use the toilet — €1 in total — and only received coupons as compensation after we had already ordered our food. The food itself was okay for the price, nothing to complain about there.\n\nUnfortunately, the service was poor from start to finish. Our waiter was completely disengaged, never communicative or friendly, and gave the impression that he really didn’t want to be there. We were polite and did nothing to cause this attitude.\n\nWhen it came time to pay, we mentioned we had two toilet coupons. He brought the bill without applying them and didn’t even ask how we wanted to pay — he just processed it as a cash payment. When we said we needed to pay by card, he became visibly annoyed and had to go back to make a new receipt. No thank you, no acknowledgment — just grumpiness.\n\nWe had already left a €2 tip on the table, which we immediately regretted. He didn’t deserve it at all. Not applying the toilet coupon discount wasn’t a huge deal financially, but it was disappointing in principle.\n\nIf you care about friendly service, be warned — we hope you don’t end up with the same waiter, or that he sees this review and reflects on how he treats guests."

I first gave the service 3 stars, but one of my friends didn't want to give a tip because he, just like me, couldn't eat to much. The waiter inserted the tip into the bill without telling us. When my friend said the bill wasn't ok the waiter said \"is only a 10% addition\". We said the food was awfull and the meal didn't desearve a tip. The waiter then asked us what was wrong - the reason he asked us was not because we barely touched the food, but beacause we didn't wan't to give a tip.

We liked the addition of reptiles and monkeys along the way, which makes it unique to other aquariums and kept the kid entertained.\nThe exhibits are not properly marked, it's easy to miss an area or two or go through some hall and reach a staircase unintentionally. There's a lot of \"dead space\" which can be utilized for something...\nThe elevators are an issue for anyone in a wheelchair/stroller. I suggest making one elevator for only going up the another only going down to prevent randomly going up and down the whole bylding just to get 1f down."

              "reviewText": "Augarten Park is one of Vienna’s most beautiful and historically rich green spaces. Nestled in the heart of the city’s second district, this meticulously maintained park offers a perfect blend of tranquility, culture, and history.\n\nThe first thing you notice upon entering Augarten is how well taken care of it is. The gardens are immaculately groomed, with tree-lined alleys, colorful flowerbeds, and expansive lawns that invite visitors to relax, walk, or picnic. The park is family-friendly, with playgrounds for children and open areas that cater to joggers, dog walkers, and those simply looking to unwind. Despite being a popular destination, it never feels overcrowded due to its generous size and thoughtful layout.\n\nWhat truly sets Augarten apart, however, is its historical depth. Dating back to the 17th century, the park was originally laid out as a baroque garden and has retained its classical charm. It’s home to the stunning Palais Augarten, a baroque palace that today houses the world-famous Vienna Boys’ Choir. The palace and its surroundings provide a unique backdrop that adds a sense of grandeur to the entire park.\n\nA striking and sobering reminder of more recent history are the two massive World War II flak towers that still stand within the park. These concrete giants, once used for air defense, serve as historical landmarks and symbols of Vienna’s complex past. Their presence offers a powerful contrast to the peaceful surroundings and invites reflection on the city’s wartime experience.\n\nWhether you're a history enthusiast, a nature lover, or just someone in search of a peaceful place to spend an afternoon, Augarten Park is a must-visit. It’s a place where Vienna’s layered history and natural beauty come together, making it both a serene escape and a living monument."

Not only did we leave with 24 hand made Mozart Kugeln, we made a delicious hot chocolate to taste. Really appreciated the 3 chocolate options (dark, milk, white) and the selection of toppings to individualize our candy. Totally recommend."

Everything was very well organized, and the instructor explained the process in a clear and engaging way, making it easy to follow along :)\n\nWorking with the chocolate was fun, and in the end you get to create 3 full chocolate bars with different toppings that you can mix and match however you like. The highlight came at the end - making and tasting the best hot chocolate based on an authentic Aztec recipe.\n\nThe museum itself is quite small, but it offers excellent information about the history of chocolate, and there is also a wonderful shop with plenty of sweets to take home.\n\nIt was such a unique and memorable experience, and we would definitely recommend it to anyone visiting Vienna!"

While we waited to start, we checked the museum, but alas, it was not a big deal.\n\nThe main attraction was surely the chocolate workshop where we each made 3-3 bars. However, the chocolate was not done by us, nor was it tempered on the tables. It was more like a \"kid-friendly method\", they were pouring from machines where we gathered them in a plastic frame (chioces: 100% dark, 70% dark , milk , pink colored white, pure white).\nFortunately, some \"mixing\" was available, so that was a plus. We did the decoration on our own whith a great vareity of ingredients. What I was missing: caramel/fudge based ingredient and M&Ms. But that was not a huge problem, there were many other options.\nWhile the chocolates hardened in the fridge we made hot chocolate/cocoa. It was a nice touch to the workshop too.\n\nIt was a great experience, and the workshop guide was very kind and helpful.\nAbsolutely recommended for everyone who loves chocolate."

Don’t be fooled by the photos—they are heavily edited and do not reflect reality.\n\nFirst off, the cleanliness was appalling. Dust and grime everywhere, stains on the furniture, and an overall musty smell that made it feel like no one had properly cleaned this place in months. The floors were sticky, and I wouldn’t even think about walking barefoot.\n\nNoise is unbearable. If you value sleep, stay far away. Paper-thin walls mean you’ll hear every conversation, every footstep, and even your neighbors’ bathroom visits. If you’re near a street, expect traffic noise all night long. It’s like trying to sleep inside a subway station."

We spent a few hours enjoying drinks and light snacks while taking in the scenery.\nHighly recommend for anyone looking for a stylish rooftop spot with great vibes and unbeatable views!"

She called in the morning to make a reservation and asked if they could prepare a small birthday gesture, like writing “Happy Birthday” next to a dessert. The staff on the phone said it was possible, maybe with an extra charge and we agreed.\n\nWhen we arrived, my mum reminded them again. One waiter said it wasn’t possible. She asked another one, who brought the manager over. The manager said they couldn’t do candles but would definitely prepare “something small.” We stayed for over two hours, had two rounds of drinks and nothing ever came.\n\nNo birthday surprise, no follow-up, nothing. Terrible communication and service. We chose this place because they said yes on the phone. If they had just said no, we would’ve gone somewhere else. Not coming back. Not recommended."

The service was overly pushy and borderline rude – we were barely given time to look at the menu before being rushed to order. That set the tone for the evening.\n\nThe food arrived with a black hair in it, forcing us to send the dish back. A replacement was provided, but with no apology, service recovery, or compensation of any kind. Matters only got worse when the waiter began clearing plates! My wife had just finished, yet while I was still cutting into my schnitzel, the waiter started taking my plate away mid-meal.\n\nTo finish, the bill came with tips already added by the waiter without any communication or consent – an unprofessional and unacceptable practice.\n\nAll in all, a disrespectful and careless dining experience. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this restaurant entirely."

It begins gently, with herbs and wildflowers arranged in an understated, almost whispering setting, all while the air grows thick with the warm, resinous scent of pine. You wander along quiet paths beneath leafy canopies in the informal garden, letting the calm settle in. Further on, the landscape shifts—more structured, more curated. Here, flowering trees catch the light, exotic plants draw your eye, and a bamboo grove adds a touch of the unexpected. But the true gem lies near the southern edge: the alpine garden. Utterly charming and deeply soothing, it’s a place you won’t want to leave—and truly, one you shouldn’t miss."
