The palace itself is elegant, but the real highlight is the Mirabell Gardens - beautifully maintained with colorful flower beds, sculptures, and fountains that make it feel like you've stepped into a fairytale. The view looking through the gardens towards the fortress is breathtaking and perfect for photos.\n\nIt's free to enter the gardens, and they're easy to walk through, so it's a great stop even if you're short on time. If you visit in spring or summer, the flowers are in full bloom and the atmosphere is magical. Music lovers will also appreciate that some of the “Sound of Music” scenes were filmed here.\n\nHighly recommend visiting in the morning before the crowds arrive - it's peaceful, romantic, and unforgettable.",

Ironically, it's not been battle tested after it was built in the 11th century. With the city pass, went up with the cable car and walked down. It would be a good climb to hike up.

The fortress approach walkway is significantly sloped, covered in fine rock and worn dirt, so wear a good pair of shoes that give good grip.  For anyone with mobility issues or if it's raining/wet, I'd highly recommend the funicular.   While the fortress has an interesting history, I was disappointed that there were not more objects of historical significance inside it.  It's actually pretty sparse inside.  There are some military items, but very few furnishings and no tapestries.  The staff were all very helpful.  The cost of a visit is very reasonable.  The view is unparalleled.  It is truly a commanding view of the surrounding countryside.  Worth doing for the view, but could use more historical/period artifacts inside and around the grounds.",

The combination of aviation, motorsport, and cutting-edge architecture is unlike anything I've seen before. The displays - from historic planes to Red Bull's Formula 1 beasts - are absolutely stunning. You can really feel the passion for speed, precision, and innovation in every corner of the space.\n\nI've uploaded some photos I took during my visit - but honestly, they don't do it justice. You have to experience it in person to really appreciate the scale and atmosphere.\n\nThe best part? Entry is free! There's also a Michelin-star restaurant and a stylish bar inside, which adds to the overall premium feel of the place.\n\nWhether you're a motorsport fan, an aviation enthusiast, or just someone who appreciates world-class design - Hangar-7 is a must-see.\n\n10/10 would visit again.",

Fortunately, the cars and motors were there and we're able to look at them at least. The fan shop is not very big, but you can find your favorite Red Bull item.",

The beds were extremely comfortable.\n\nThe hotel was dog friendly , although we kept our dog in the room for breakfast and dinner upon request which we were happy with.\n\nThe view from our room was spectacular and a lovely way to wake up each day.\n\nThe breakfast was excellent and couldn't wish for a better start to the morning. There was a wide selection. I believe the dining room has been recently renovated and it was beautiful.\n\nWe ate dinner at the hotel and it was such a very tasty and relaxing experience that we chose to return the following evening for dinner also. We would recommend a price list for daily specials.\n\nWe would love to return to the hotel again in a different season. We imagine it would also be a great experience.\n\nThe bus stop is 2 minutes walk and it is around 15-20 minutes to get to the centre of Salzburg. Around 40 minutes to the HBF with one bus change. We also bought a 24hr bus ticket from the hotel reception.\n\nThe family owners are very friendly. Thank you.",

Riding through the forests and quiet country paths to the palace was one of our favorite activities.\n\nThe breakfasts were fresh and delicious, with a great variety of choices, and the dinner we had was some of the best food we had in Austria.\n\nThe bus stop is just a short walk from the pension, making it very easy to get to the center of Salzburg.\n\nWe were sad to go when our stay ended, and hope to return someday soon.",

Slept well in comfort (caveat - I travel with facemask and earplugs) Room was spacious. The bathroom has a toilet separated with a slide door from the rest of the bathroom rather than an all in one like you can see sometimes. Shower had good pressure and pleasant temperature. We didn't use the balcony much due to the weather but it would be nice in the evening in a warmer evening with a couple of chairs, lounger and shade. The room also had a couple of reading chairs and a desk to offer flexibility and a good size TV in line with the bed.\n\nStaff really have attention to detail, we got some wine from a supermarket when out and left it in the room and they brought us glasses without asking.\n\nThe bath had a jacuzzi option but we didn't use it.\n\nMy only negative thoughts on the room:\n\nI would suggest to the hotel that a bar or non-slip mat might be useful as you're stepping out the bath onto a tiled floor and only have the towel rail on your left or the bath to grab if you do wobble as the only other option is the glass splash protector\n\nOptions on pillows would be useful (maybe a question on booking?) - we didn't ask so maybe it was an option but I like a firm pillow, the 2 provided were pretty soft and floppy\n\nI would like a kettle in the room but the machine downstairs is always available - just means you have to get showered or at least dressed to get any, I prefer to get out of bed and have some coffee before going down.\n\nBreakfast\n\nPlenty of options - bread and bagels, cakes and sweets plus cold meats, cheese etc + fruit, freshly poured smoothie and juice, cereals. We had maybe 20 minutes each day there, taking time and enjoying the food\n\nThere was only one coffee machine but breakfast was never that busy when we were there so wasn't a major issue\n\nMy only complaints were that there was no hot buffet, only the offer of eggs (which I don't like) - some sausage or bacon to be offered, would be something to consider?\n\nHotel is incredibly easy to get to on the bus from the station (160 I think), about 10 stops, free if you get the Salzburg card which I would recommend anyway due to the free access to so many things",

The venue presents itself as an inclusive space, mindful of important social issues, and at first, the atmosphere seemed positive. However, the way I was treated by the staff was completely unacceptable.\n\nAfter paying €20 for entry, I was on the dance floor when I made eye contact with a girl who seemed a bit serious. In a totally normal and respectful way, I lightly touched her shoulder and asked if she was okay. Anyone with some clubbing experience knows that interactions like this are part of a normal, social night out.\n\nA few minutes later, as I was moving to another room, two staff members approached me and told me not to touch people, implying that several different people had complained about my behavior. This happened without them talking to me first, without knowing what had actually occurred, and without giving me a chance to explain myself.\n\nI felt discriminated against and humiliated, and my night was completely ruined. I decided to leave after only an hour and a half.\n\nWhat struck me the most was how quickly they judged me. I wonder if I would have been treated the same way if I weren't a foreigner. I had the clear impression that the staff acted with prejudice, making assumptions about me without any effort to hear my side of the story.\n\nIt's ironic that a club that claims to be modern and inclusive has such a rigid and unfair approach, passing judgment without dialogue. If inclusion means feeling watched and treated like a problem for a completely respectful interaction, then something is seriously wrong.",

It was a quiet and beautiful moment, made even more special because we used to watch “The Sound of Music” together. Being in a place so connected to the film added a layer of meaning to the experience.\n\nThis spot is serene and reflective, perfect for appreciating Salzburg's rich past or finding a moment of connection and peace.

The walking trail runs along the historic defence wall and is dotted with viewpoints, small gates, and cultural landmarks.\n\nI explored Mönchsberg as part of my hike down from Fortress Hohensalzburg, first passing the Museum der Moderne Salzburg, then crossing Schartentor before reaching Humboldtterrasse. From here, panoramic vistas unfolded-the red and grey rooftops of the Altstadt, the green domes of Salzburg Cathedral, the Salzach River winding through town, and the Alps beyond.\n\nIt was surprisingly quiet along the trail, with only a few locals enjoying the park and the view, making the walk feel peaceful and unhurried. Eventually, I continued to Klausentor, took a short break at Café am Kai, crossed Müllnersteg footbridge, and returned to Mirabell Palace.\n\n🧭 Tip: This is one of Salzburg's best free activities. Come in the late afternoon for softer light and fewer people. Wear comfortable shoes-the trail is easy but involves some inclines and steps.",
