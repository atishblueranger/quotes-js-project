From here, you get a panoramic view of the majestic City Palace, shimmering Lake Pichola, and the stunning reflections of the palaces, ghats, and heritage buildings across the water. It's the perfect place to take in the royal beauty of the city-all in one frame.\n\nI first visited during the day and was mesmerized by the peaceful vibes, the cool breeze from the lake, and the sound of temple bells in the background. There are several small temples around the ghat, adding a spiritual and serene charm to the area.\n\nThe walk to Ambrai Ghat from Gangaur Ghat is an experience in itself. You cross a lovely walking bridge decorated with beautiful poles and lamps, offering picturesque views along the way. It feels like walking through a postcard scene.\n\nLater at night, I went back hoping to catch the palace beautifully lit up-but the main entrance to the ghat was closed. However, I found a perfect alternative: you can still enjoy the same mesmerizing night view by entering through the Ambrai Ghat Restaurant. The restaurant offers direct access to the lakefront with the same iconic view-ideal for dinner with a royal backdrop.\n\nIf you're visiting Udaipur, Ambrai Ghat is a must-see. Whether it's for the peaceful morning lake view or the sparkling lights of the City Palace at night, it's an unforgettable experience. Don't miss it-walk, sit, click photos, or just breathe in the charm of Udaipur from this beautiful spot.",

This palace is totally made for the sunset view. I visited here in march end week and I missed the sunset view from the karni mata mandir. But caught the full 🌇 sunset view at this palace.\n\nThe price can be feel bit high but truly worth it. Here, you can go by your own vehicle or by buying ticket for car service that will provide take and drop service.\n\nNote: If you took their vehicle service don't lost the ticket as the contact details are written on the ticket only. So , if you missed the last car while enjoying till bit late. So you can contact them and they will come to pick you. But try to come back till 6pm last after that you will not get auto or any online service as this place is far from local areas.",

The road leading to the top is about 4 km long, steep, and winding, making it more suitable for experienced drivers.\nAuto-rickshaws are not allowed, so visitors must either use their own vehicle or a government-approved cab. At the top, there's a small restaurant where you can enjoy coffee and snacks amidst scenic views and cool, refreshing winds.\nFrom the palace, you get a panoramic view of Udaipur city, which is truly mesmerizing and peaceful. The palace also features a small wildlife exhibit and an interactive projector where you can see yourself amidst wild animals-a fun experience, though nothing extraordinary.\nYou should plan to spend at least an hour exploring the place. However, I felt the entry ticket (₹174 per person) is a bit overpriced for what's offered. Also, personal car parking costs ₹338, which is quite expensive and should be reviewed by the authorities.\n\nOverall, the place is worth visiting for nature lovers and photographers, especially during the rainy season but be prepared for the high charges.",

            "text": "Beautiful Location, Especially During Monsoon But a Bit Overpriced..\n\nMonsoon Palace is located on a hill surrounded by lush greenery, offering breathtaking views especially during the monsoon season, when its natural beauty multiplies. The road leading to the top is about 4 km long, steep, and winding, making it more suitable for experienced drivers.\nAuto-rickshaws are not allowed, so visitors must either use their own vehicle or a government-approved cab. At the top, there's a small restaurant where you can enjoy coffee and snacks amidst scenic views and cool, refreshing winds.\nFrom the palace, you get a panoramic view of Udaipur city, which is truly mesmerizing and peaceful. The palace also features a small wildlife exhibit and an interactive projector where you can see yourself amidst wild animals-a fun experience, though nothing extraordinary.\nYou should plan to spend at least an hour exploring the place. However, I felt the entry ticket (₹174 per person) is a bit overpriced for what's offered. Also, personal car parking costs ₹338, which is quite expensive and should be reviewed by the authorities.\n\nOverall, the place is worth visiting for nature lovers and photographers, especially during the rainy season but be prepared for the high charges.",

This palace is totally made for the sunset view. I visited here in march end week and I missed the sunset view from the karni mata mandir. But caught the full 🌇 sunset view at this palace.\n\nThe price can be feel bit high but truly worth it. Here, you can go by your own vehicle or by buying ticket for car service that will provide take and drop service.\n\nNote: If you took their vehicle service don't lost the ticket as the contact details are written on the ticket only. So , if you missed the last car while enjoying till bit late. So you can contact them and they will come to pick you. But try to come back till 6pm last after that you will not get auto or any online service as this place is far from local areas.",

You can enter from the City Palace side, where you need to buy a ticket for the boat ride. The boat ride is one of the best experiences you can have - the calm water, the cool breeze, and the amazing view of old buildings and the sunset make it unforgettable.\n\nThe boat also stops at Jag Mandir, which is a beautiful place to walk around and click some great pictures. The only thing I didn't like was the food at Jag Mandir - it's way too expensive. But apart from that, Lake Pichola is truly a place that feels like another world.

            "text": "Bagore Ki Haveli is one of the most memorable places I visited in Udaipur. Located right near Gangaur Ghat and overlooking Lake Pichola, it gives off a very authentic Rajasthani vibe. The haveli itself is beautifully restored and has over 100 rooms filled with old photographs, costumes, weapons, royal artifacts, and some really intricate mirror and glass work.The best part for me was the evening cultural show (Dharohar) held in the courtyard-absolutely worth attending! Traditional Rajasthani folk dances, puppetry, and live music performances made it super lively and entertaining. The dancers were amazing, especially the woman who balanced multiple pots on her head-so talented! Pro tip: reach at least 30–45 minutes early to get front row seats because it gets crowded fast.I also enjoyed exploring the different parts of the haveli, like the royal bedroom, women's quarters, and balconies with stunning views of the lake. The ticket prices are very reasonable (₹60 for Indians + ₹150 camera fee, approx), and it feels like a great value for the experience.It's located in the Old City, so the streets are narrow, and it's better to walk or take a tuk-tuk instead of driving. You can easily visit Jagdish Temple or take a boat ride nearby after this. Bagore Ki Haveli is a must-visit if you're in Udaipur and love history, culture, or just want to see something different and real.",

It only costs ₹40 per person, which is a total steal for how serene and pretty it is.\n\nYes, like many public spaces, some people still litter-but the staff here does a great job cleaning up and preserving the beauty of the space.\n\nThis part isn't just about the garden, but we feel it needs to be said: even if you have a small platform, use it to spread the message. Please be responsible when you're out in public. Carry a small bag, collect your trash, and dispose of it properly. It's such a small thing, but it makes a huge difference.\n\nHappy holidaying-and let's keep our shared spaces beautiful.",
