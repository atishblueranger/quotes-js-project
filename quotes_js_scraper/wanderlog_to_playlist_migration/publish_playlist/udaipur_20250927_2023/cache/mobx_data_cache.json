It’s the kind of place where you can truly slow down and enjoy your time. The best part? It only costs ₹40 per person, which is a total steal for how serene and pretty it is.\n\nYes, like many public spaces, some people still litter—but the staff here does a great job cleaning up and preserving the beauty of the space.\n\nThis part isn’t just about the garden, but we feel it needs to be said: even if you have a small platform, use it to spread the message. Please be responsible when you’re out in public. Carry a small bag, collect your trash, and dispose of it properly. It’s such a small thing, but it makes a huge difference.\n\nHappy holidaying—and let’s keep our shared spaces beautiful."

The sheer grandeur envelops you from the moment you enter, with architecture that gracefully marries elegance and legacy. Every corridor whispers stories of a bygone era, where artistry met opulence.\nFrom the intricately carved facades to the richly adorned queen’s chambers, the palace stuns with its attention to detail. Personal belongings preserved through time add an intimate touch, bridging centuries in quiet reverence. The interiors are not just aesthetically beautiful—they’re deeply immersive, offering a glimpse into royal life that feels almost tangible.\nI highly recommend taking a guided tour—not only for the deeper historical insights but also for discovering the hidden corners perfect for photographs. Every nook holds a narrative, and with the right guide, those stories truly come alive.\nIf you’re visiting Udaipur, this palace is an absolute must. It’s more than a tourist attraction; it’s a soulful experience that lingers long after you've left."

The moment you step through its grand entrance, you are greeted by an atmosphere of peace that stands in sharp contrast to the bustling city streets just outside.\n\nThe temple’s intricate carvings are simply mesmerizing, telling stories from ancient times with astonishing detail. Every pillar and corner showcases the remarkable craftsmanship of the artisans who built it nearly 400 years ago. As you climb the elegant marble steps, the energy shifts — it’s almost as if time slows down to let you soak in the spiritual vibe.\n\nThe idol of Lord Vishnu (in the form of Jagannath) at the sanctum is stunning and radiates a serene, almost magnetic presence. Morning and evening aartis (prayer rituals) add an extra layer of magic to the experience, filling the temple with soulful chants and the fragrance of incense.\n\nWhat truly sets Jagdish Temple apart is how seamlessly it blends into the life of Udaipur — it's a living, breathing part of the city’s soul. Whether you're a devotee, a history lover, or simply an explorer seeking hidden gems, this temple promises a deeply enriching experience.\n\nIf you’re in Udaipur, a visit to Jagdish Temple isn’t just recommended — it’s essential."

Intricate carvings, beautifully done ceilings, and walls that felt like storybooks. The temple is a three-story structure, with the main shrine dedicated to Lord Vishnu. And while we don’t really know much about temples or the deeper meanings behind everything, we do know good architecture when we see it—and this one was something else.\n\nThe walls are painted with scenes from Hindu mythology—Ramayana, Mahabharata, all of it—and even without knowing every reference, it’s hard not to be impressed. Everything looked so carefully crafted, like someone had poured their entire soul into every detail.\n\nWe took over a hundred pictures, not even kidding. These are just a few clicks we decided to post, but trust us, we could’ve made a whole photo album out of it. If you’re even a little into architecture or historical design, this place is a must-visit.\n\nAlso—major plus—it’s free. No entry fee, no fancy ticket. It’s a temple, open to all, which just adds to how cool and accessible it feels.\n\nOnly reason we’re giving it 4 stars instead of 5? The maintenance. Or rather, the lack of it. It’s honestly sad to see something this beautiful, something people actively worship, just not being taken care of. The structure deserves so much more respect. The government seriously needs to wake up and put some effort into preserving places like this. If you’re gonna call it cultural heritage, then treat it like one."

This is an exceptional example of Rajput architecture.\nMandir ko banane ka maksad sirf bhakti nahi tha, balki Mewar ki shaan aur kala ki takat dikhana bhi tha.\nThe temple has 50 beautifully carved pillars which is just wow, what a wonder.\n\nThe evening aarti at Jagdish Mandir is truly a divine experience. The lamps, the sound of temple bells, and the chants of devotees create a powerful and peaceful atmosphere that you really have to feel for yourself.\n\nThe location of Jagdish Mandir is also super convenient it's right in the heart of Udaipur. You won’t just visit the temple, but also get the chance to explore some amazing nearby spots like\n* Lake pichola (just a short walk or you can take auto/taxi, etc.)\n* city palace (literally walking distance from the maintemple)\n* Hathi pol & ashwini bazar (market famous for local art and handicraft)\n* Gangaur ghat (a ghat which is a great place to explore from there you'll see the iconic city palace's view).\n\nPlus, since the temple is located in the Old City, you’ll find some really charming cafes in the narrow lanes perfect for grabbing a bite or coffee after sightseeing. The whole area is quite popular amongst the tourists, so you’ll always see a lively vibe with travelers exploring the streets and having the best time."

This palace is totally made for the sunset view. I visited here in march end week and I missed the sunset view from the karni mata mandir. But caught the full 🌇 sunset view at this palace.\n\nThe price can be feel bit high but truly worth it. Here, you can go by your own vehicle or by buying ticket for car service that will provide take and drop service.\n\nNote: If you took their vehicle service don't lost the ticket as the contact details are written on the ticket only. So , if you missed the last car while enjoying till bit late. So you can contact them and they will come to pick you. But try to come back till 6pm last after that you will not get auto or any online service as this place is far from local areas."

While the structure itself is modest, the views are unforgettable—especially during sunset or after the monsoon rains. It’s a must-visit for anyone seeking a tranquil, picture-perfect escape with a touch of royal nostalgia."

The view from the top is unforgettable, especially during the monsoon season when the greenery comes alive.\n\nThe drive up to the palace is equally scenic, with winding roads and lush landscapes that make the journey as enjoyable as the destination. Clouds drifting by, cool breeze, and light rain – it’s truly magical.\n\nIf you’re in Udaipur during the rains, this is a must-visit spot. The combination of nature, views, and peaceful vibes make it a perfect escape."

If you have your own vehicle you can go up by your own vehicle by paying fees.\nIt cost 174 per head for persons entry and 120 for the trip up and down. If you have car you have to pay 338 and if you have bike you have to pay 72.\nIt’s a nice place we didn’t get sunset view because it was raining. Just one suggestion don’t go there on public holiday."

              "reviewText": "Beautiful Location, Especially During Monsoon But a Bit Overpriced..\n\nMonsoon Palace is located on a hill surrounded by lush greenery, offering breathtaking views especially during the monsoon season, when its natural beauty multiplies. The road leading to the top is about 4 km long, steep, and winding, making it more suitable for experienced drivers.\nAuto-rickshaws are not allowed, so visitors must either use their own vehicle or a government-approved cab. At the top, there's a small restaurant where you can enjoy coffee and snacks amidst scenic views and cool, refreshing winds.\nFrom the palace, you get a panoramic view of Udaipur city, which is truly mesmerizing and peaceful. The palace also features a small wildlife exhibit and an interactive projector where you can see yourself amidst wild animals—a fun experience, though nothing extraordinary.\nYou should plan to spend at least an hour exploring the place. However, I felt the entry ticket (₹174 per person) is a bit overpriced for what’s offered. Also, personal car parking costs ₹338, which is quite expensive and should be reviewed by the authorities.\n\nOverall, the place is worth visiting for nature lovers and photographers, especially during the rainy season but be prepared for the high charges."

It was monsoon season, so the entire place was wrapped in mist and rain, making it feel like something out of a dream. I forgot to carry an umbrella, but honestly, the beauty of the place made up for it. The cool breeze, the soft drizzle, and the breathtaking views were just unforgettable.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys hiking, this destination is definitely worth adding to your list. The trails are scenic, peaceful, and offer some incredible photo opportunities.\n\nOne word of advice: if you're not a regular or confident driver, I highly recommend hiring a local driver. The roads leading up to the hill station are quite steep, with sharp turns and narrow stretches that can be challenging to navigate, especially in the rain. Local drivers are experienced with these routes and will make your journey safer and more comfortable.\n\nOverall, it was a magical trip, and I’d absolutely go back—just with an umbrella next time!"

You can enter from the City Palace side, where you need to buy a ticket for the boat ride. The boat ride is one of the best experiences you can have — the calm water, the cool breeze, and the amazing view of old buildings and the sunset make it unforgettable.\n\nThe boat also stops at Jag Mandir, which is a beautiful place to walk around and click some great pictures. The only thing I didn’t like was the food at Jag Mandir — it’s way too expensive. But apart from that, Lake Pichola is truly a place that feels like another world. A must-visit when you are in Udaipur!"

Surrounded by stunning architecture like the City Palace, Jag Mandir, and the Lake Palace, it offers a picture-perfect view that feels straight out of a postcard. I spent quite some time just walking along the lakefront near the City Palace, and every angle felt like it was made to be photographed.\n\nWhat makes the lake so special is the way it reflects the colors of the sky—especially during sunrise and sunset. The changing hues, combined with the calm water and the majestic palaces floating in the middle, create an almost dream-like atmosphere. I took a boat ride during sunset, and it was honestly the best decision. Passing by Jag Mandir with the City Palace glowing in the background was just unforgettable.There’s a certain peace to being by Lake Pichola. Even with tourists around, it doesn’t feel chaotic. The breeze, the soft sounds of water, and the views make it a perfect spot to slow down and just take it all in.\n\nIf you’re in Udaipur, don’t miss this. Whether you’re exploring the palaces nearby or just enjoying a quiet evening by the ghats, Lake Pichola truly captures the soul of the city."

Built in 1362 AD, it’s surrounded by palaces, temples, ghats, and scenic hills, making it one of the most romantic and iconic places in Rajasthan.\n\n---\n\n🌊 Highlights:\n\nBoat Ride Experience: The boat ride (especially at sunset) is magical. It offers stunning views of the City Palace, Jag Mandir, Taj Lake Palace, and the surrounding hills.\n\nPalaces on the Water:\n\nJag Mandir – open for visitors with a royal feel.\n\nLake Palace (Taj Hotel) – visible from the boat, known for its heritage charm.\n\nScenic Surroundings: Aravalli hills, old havelis, and historic ghats like Gangaur Ghat add to the lake’s timeless beauty.\n\nBest Views: Ambrai Ghat, Lal Ghat, City Palace, and from rooftop cafés.\n\n---\n\n✅ Pros:\n\nMesmerizing views, especially during sunrise and sunset.\n\nPeaceful ambiance ideal for couples, families, and photographers.\n\nBoat ride is well-organized and gives a full experience.\n\nLots of scenic spots nearby (ghats, temples, cafés).\n\n---\n\n❌ Cons:\n\nBoat rides can be a bit pricey (₹400–₹800 depending on type and time).\n\nCrowded during weekends and peak tourist season.\n\nLimited public seating around the lake.\n\n---\n\n💡 Tips:\n\nSunset boat ride is the best — golden light + cool breeze.\n\nVisit Ambrai Ghat for peaceful lake views and evening photography.\n\nIf on a budget, skip the palace entry and just enjoy the ghats.\n\n---\n\n⭐ Final Verdict:\n\nLake Pichola is the soul of Udaipur — calm, romantic, and regal.

There were long queues, and even with two separate lines (possibly for ticket types), the wait was too much — so we ended up skipping the boat ride.\n\nStill, we didn’t want to miss the iconic sunset view, and honestly, it didn’t disappoint. The golden hour reflecting off the water with views of the City Palace, Jag Mandir, and Taj Lake Palace in the middle of the lake was absolutely magical.\n\nBoating prices vary:\n• We selected ₹200 one, because there was long wait in other slots.\n\nAround ₹400–₹600 per person for regular boat rides\n\n₹800–₹1000 for sunset or evening slots (private boats cost more)\n\nAlso, there's a man who has a telescope so you can see the view which charges ₹20 to ₹50 per person. There are a lot many snacks counters where you can buy but while entering the boat they don't allow the food, so make sure to avoid carrying any.\n\nIf you really want to experience it without the rush, try visiting on a weekday or early morning. Even without boating, just sitting by the lake and soaking in the views is worth it."

My biggest concern was time, as I am very much busy with my profession and I cannot spend time searching carpenter, martial provider, or any other supplier.

Currently the tower is undergoing renovations, but you can still see enough of it.\n\nWorth a quick look if in the area, especially as the tower is in the main tourist circuit of Udaipur, otherwise I wouldn’t go out of the way to see it."

You can enter from the City Palace side, where you need to buy a ticket for the boat ride. The boat ride is one of the best experiences you can have — the calm water, the cool breeze, and the amazing view of old buildings and the sunset make it unforgettable.\n\nThe boat also stops at Jag Mandir, which is a beautiful place to walk around and click some great pictures. The only thing I didn’t like was the food at Jag Mandir — it’s way too expensive. But apart from that, Lake Pichola is truly a place that feels like another world. A must-visit when you are in Udaipur!"

Surrounded by stunning architecture like the City Palace, Jag Mandir, and the Lake Palace, it offers a picture-perfect view that feels straight out of a postcard. I spent quite some time just walking along the lakefront near the City Palace, and every angle felt like it was made to be photographed.\n\nWhat makes the lake so special is the way it reflects the colors of the sky—especially during sunrise and sunset. The changing hues, combined with the calm water and the majestic palaces floating in the middle, create an almost dream-like atmosphere. I took a boat ride during sunset, and it was honestly the best decision. Passing by Jag Mandir with the City Palace glowing in the background was just unforgettable.There’s a certain peace to being by Lake Pichola. Even with tourists around, it doesn’t feel chaotic. The breeze, the soft sounds of water, and the views make it a perfect spot to slow down and just take it all in.\n\nIf you’re in Udaipur, don’t miss this. Whether you’re exploring the palaces nearby or just enjoying a quiet evening by the ghats, Lake Pichola truly captures the soul of the city."

Built in 1362 AD, it’s surrounded by palaces, temples, ghats, and scenic hills, making it one of the most romantic and iconic places in Rajasthan.\n\n---\n\n🌊 Highlights:\n\nBoat Ride Experience: The boat ride (especially at sunset) is magical. It offers stunning views of the City Palace, Jag Mandir, Taj Lake Palace, and the surrounding hills.\n\nPalaces on the Water:\n\nJag Mandir – open for visitors with a royal feel.\n\nLake Palace (Taj Hotel) – visible from the boat, known for its heritage charm.\n\nScenic Surroundings: Aravalli hills, old havelis, and historic ghats like Gangaur Ghat add to the lake’s timeless beauty.\n\nBest Views: Ambrai Ghat, Lal Ghat, City Palace, and from rooftop cafés.\n\n---\n\n✅ Pros:\n\nMesmerizing views, especially during sunrise and sunset.\n\nPeaceful ambiance ideal for couples, families, and photographers.\n\nBoat ride is well-organized and gives a full experience.\n\nLots of scenic spots nearby (ghats, temples, cafés).\n\n---\n\n❌ Cons:\n\nBoat rides can be a bit pricey (₹400–₹800 depending on type and time).\n\nCrowded during weekends and peak tourist season.\n\nLimited public seating around the lake.\n\n---\n\n💡 Tips:\n\nSunset boat ride is the best — golden light + cool breeze.\n\nVisit Ambrai Ghat for peaceful lake views and evening photography.\n\nIf on a budget, skip the palace entry and just enjoy the ghats.\n\n---\n\n⭐ Final Verdict:\n\nLake Pichola is the soul of Udaipur — calm, romantic, and regal.

There were long queues, and even with two separate lines (possibly for ticket types), the wait was too much — so we ended up skipping the boat ride.\n\nStill, we didn’t want to miss the iconic sunset view, and honestly, it didn’t disappoint. The golden hour reflecting off the water with views of the City Palace, Jag Mandir, and Taj Lake Palace in the middle of the lake was absolutely magical.\n\nBoating prices vary:\n• We selected ₹200 one, because there was long wait in other slots.\n\nAround ₹400–₹600 per person for regular boat rides\n\n₹800–₹1000 for sunset or evening slots (private boats cost more)\n\nAlso, there's a man who has a telescope so you can see the view which charges ₹20 to ₹50 per person. There are a lot many snacks counters where you can buy but while entering the boat they don't allow the food, so make sure to avoid carrying any.\n\nIf you really want to experience it without the rush, try visiting on a weekday or early morning. Even without boating, just sitting by the lake and soaking in the views is worth it."

This palace is totally made for the sunset view. I visited here in march end week and I missed the sunset view from the karni mata mandir. But caught the full 🌇 sunset view at this palace.\n\nThe price can be feel bit high but truly worth it. Here, you can go by your own vehicle or by buying ticket for car service that will provide take and drop service.\n\nNote: If you took their vehicle service don't lost the ticket as the contact details are written on the ticket only. So , if you missed the last car while enjoying till bit late. So you can contact them and they will come to pick you. But try to come back till 6pm last after that you will not get auto or any online service as this place is far from local areas."

The view from the top is unforgettable, especially during the monsoon season when the greenery comes alive.\n\nThe drive up to the palace is equally scenic, with winding roads and lush landscapes that make the journey as enjoyable as the destination. Clouds drifting by, cool breeze, and light rain – it’s truly magical.\n\nIf you’re in Udaipur during the rains, this is a must-visit spot. The combination of nature, views, and peaceful vibes make it a perfect escape."

If you have your own vehicle you can go up by your own vehicle by paying fees.\nIt cost 174 per head for persons entry and 120 for the trip up and down. If you have car you have to pay 338 and if you have bike you have to pay 72.\nIt’s a nice place we didn’t get sunset view because it was raining.

              "reviewText": "Beautiful Location, Especially During Monsoon But a Bit Overpriced..\n\nMonsoon Palace is located on a hill surrounded by lush greenery, offering breathtaking views especially during the monsoon season, when its natural beauty multiplies. The road leading to the top is about 4 km long, steep, and winding, making it more suitable for experienced drivers.\nAuto-rickshaws are not allowed, so visitors must either use their own vehicle or a government-approved cab. At the top, there's a small restaurant where you can enjoy coffee and snacks amidst scenic views and cool, refreshing winds.\nFrom the palace, you get a panoramic view of Udaipur city, which is truly mesmerizing and peaceful. The palace also features a small wildlife exhibit and an interactive projector where you can see yourself amidst wild animals—a fun experience, though nothing extraordinary.\nYou should plan to spend at least an hour exploring the place. However, I felt the entry ticket (₹174 per person) is a bit overpriced for what’s offered. Also, personal car parking costs ₹338, which is quite expensive and should be reviewed by the authorities.\n\nOverall, the place is worth visiting for nature lovers and photographers, especially during the rainy season but be prepared for the high charges."

It was monsoon season, so the entire place was wrapped in mist and rain, making it feel like something out of a dream. I forgot to carry an umbrella, but honestly, the beauty of the place made up for it. The cool breeze, the soft drizzle, and the breathtaking views were just unforgettable.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys hiking, this destination is definitely worth adding to your list. The trails are scenic, peaceful, and offer some incredible photo opportunities.\n\nOne word of advice: if you're not a regular or confident driver, I highly recommend hiring a local driver. The roads leading up to the hill station are quite steep, with sharp turns and narrow stretches that can be challenging to navigate, especially in the rain. Local drivers are experienced with these routes and will make your journey safer and more comfortable.\n\nOverall, it was a magical trip, and I’d absolutely go back—just with an umbrella next time!"

The sheer grandeur envelops you from the moment you enter, with architecture that gracefully marries elegance and legacy. Every corridor whispers stories of a bygone era, where artistry met opulence.\nFrom the intricately carved facades to the richly adorned queen’s chambers, the palace stuns with its attention to detail. Personal belongings preserved through time add an intimate touch, bridging centuries in quiet reverence. The interiors are not just aesthetically beautiful—they’re deeply immersive, offering a glimpse into royal life that feels almost tangible.\nI highly recommend taking a guided tour—not only for the deeper historical insights but also for discovering the hidden corners perfect for photographs. Every nook holds a narrative, and with the right guide, those stories truly come alive.\nIf you’re visiting Udaipur, this palace is an absolute must. It’s more than a tourist attraction; it’s a soulful experience that lingers long after you've left."

The moment you step through its grand entrance, you are greeted by an atmosphere of peace that stands in sharp contrast to the bustling city streets just outside.\n\nThe temple’s intricate carvings are simply mesmerizing, telling stories from ancient times with astonishing detail. Every pillar and corner showcases the remarkable craftsmanship of the artisans who built it nearly 400 years ago. As you climb the elegant marble steps, the energy shifts — it’s almost as if time slows down to let you soak in the spiritual vibe.\n\nThe idol of Lord Vishnu (in the form of Jagannath) at the sanctum is stunning and radiates a serene, almost magnetic presence. Morning and evening aartis (prayer rituals) add an extra layer of magic to the experience, filling the temple with soulful chants and the fragrance of incense.\n\nWhat truly sets Jagdish Temple apart is how seamlessly it blends into the life of Udaipur — it's a living, breathing part of the city’s soul. Whether you're a devotee, a history lover, or simply an explorer seeking hidden gems, this temple promises a deeply enriching experience.\n\nIf you’re in Udaipur, a visit to Jagdish Temple isn’t just recommended — it’s essential."

Intricate carvings, beautifully done ceilings, and walls that felt like storybooks. The temple is a three-story structure, with the main shrine dedicated to Lord Vishnu. And while we don’t really know much about temples or the deeper meanings behind everything, we do know good architecture when we see it—and this one was something else.\n\nThe walls are painted with scenes from Hindu mythology—Ramayana, Mahabharata, all of it—and even without knowing every reference, it’s hard not to be impressed. Everything looked so carefully crafted, like someone had poured their entire soul into every detail.\n\nWe took over a hundred pictures, not even kidding. These are just a few clicks we decided to post, but trust us, we could’ve made a whole photo album out of it. If you’re even a little into architecture or historical design, this place is a must-visit.\n\nAlso—major plus—it’s free. No entry fee, no fancy ticket. It’s a temple, open to all, which just adds to how cool and accessible it feels.\n\nOnly reason we’re giving it 4 stars instead of 5? The maintenance. Or rather, the lack of it. It’s honestly sad to see something this beautiful, something people actively worship, just not being taken care of. The structure deserves so much more respect. The government seriously needs to wake up and put some effort into preserving places like this. If you’re gonna call it cultural heritage, then treat it like one."

This is an exceptional example of Rajput architecture.\nMandir ko banane ka maksad sirf bhakti nahi tha, balki Mewar ki shaan aur kala ki takat dikhana bhi tha.\nThe temple has 50 beautifully carved pillars which is just wow, what a wonder.\n\nThe evening aarti at Jagdish Mandir is truly a divine experience. The lamps, the sound of temple bells, and the chants of devotees create a powerful and peaceful atmosphere that you really have to feel for yourself.\n\nThe location of Jagdish Mandir is also super convenient it's right in the heart of Udaipur. You won’t just visit the temple, but also get the chance to explore some amazing nearby spots like\n* Lake pichola (just a short walk or you can take auto/taxi, etc.)\n* city palace (literally walking distance from the maintemple)\n* Hathi pol & ashwini bazar (market famous for local art and handicraft)\n* Gangaur ghat (a ghat which is a great place to explore from there you'll see the iconic city palace's view).\n\nPlus, since the temple is located in the Old City, you’ll find some really charming cafes in the narrow lanes perfect for grabbing a bite or coffee after sightseeing. The whole area is quite popular amongst the tourists, so you’ll always see a lively vibe with travelers exploring the streets and having the best time."

              "reviewText": "Bagore Ki Haveli is one of the most memorable places I visited in Udaipur. Located right near Gangaur Ghat and overlooking Lake Pichola, it gives off a very authentic Rajasthani vibe. The haveli itself is beautifully restored and has over 100 rooms filled with old photographs, costumes, weapons, royal artifacts, and some really intricate mirror and glass work.The best part for me was the evening cultural show (Dharohar) held in the courtyard—absolutely worth attending! Traditional Rajasthani folk dances, puppetry, and live music performances made it super lively and entertaining. The dancers were amazing, especially the woman who balanced multiple pots on her head—so talented! Pro tip: reach at least 30–45 minutes early to get front row seats because it gets crowded fast.I also enjoyed exploring the different parts of the haveli, like the royal bedroom, women’s quarters, and balconies with stunning views of the lake. The ticket prices are very reasonable (₹60 for Indians + ₹150 camera fee, approx), and it feels like a great value for the experience.It’s located in the Old City, so the streets are narrow, and it’s better to walk or take a tuk-tuk instead of driving. You can easily visit Jagdish Temple or take a boat ride nearby after this. Bagore Ki Haveli is a must-visit if you’re in Udaipur and love history, culture, or just want to see something different and real."

The ticket is priced at ₹125 per person, and if you wish to use your phone camera to take photos or record videos, there’s an additional ₹125 charge. I highly recommend paying this extra amount — it’s a small way to show respect for the artists and the incredible effort put into preserving and showcasing Rajasthan's rich cultural heritage.\n\nThe cultural show runs from 7 PM to 8 PM, and tickets are available starting at 6 PM. I suggest entering the museum by 6:30 PM to grab a front-row seat.\n\nOverall, Bagore Ki Haveli is a place you shouldn’t miss, especially the cultural performance — it’s absolutely worth it."

Built by Amir Chand Badwa, the Prime Minister of Mewar, this haveli is now a well-preserved museum and cultural hub that attracts both history enthusiasts and art lovers.\n\nThe architecture of Bagore Ki Haveli is a fine example of traditional Mewari style, featuring intricately carved jharokhas, expansive courtyards, decorative archways, and more than 100 rooms. Each room showcases authentic royal artifacts such as costumes, weapons, jewelry, and musical instruments, giving visitors a true taste of regal Rajasthani life. The Queen’s Chamber, with its beautifully colored glass windows and mirror work, is particularly captivating.\n\nOne of the major highlights of the haveli is the evening cultural performance, known as the Dharohar Dance Show. Held in the open-air Neem Chowk courtyard, this show features traditional Rajasthani folk dances, puppetry, and music performed by skilled local artists. The vibrant atmosphere, rhythmic music, and colorful costumes create an unforgettable experience that celebrates Rajasthan’s folk heritage.\n\nThe haveli also offers stunning views of Lake Pichola and the surrounding palaces, making it a photographer’s delight. It’s centrally located and easy to access from other Udaipur landmarks.\n\nOverall, Bagore Ki Haveli is a must-visit for anyone looking to experience the artistic, cultural, and architectural legacy of Udaipur. It perfectly blends historical significance with vibrant local tradition."

              "reviewText": "The Darikhana Restaurant at Jagmandir Island Palace is undeniably beautiful. The setting is stunning, with peaceful views of Lake Pichola and the palace architecture providing a picturesque backdrop for a fine dining experience. The food was impressive, especially the Lotus Stem Annar ki Bhel and the Subz Biryani, both of which were flavorful and thoughtfully prepared. The biryani was aromatic, well-balanced, and served with care.\n\nHowever, the service was not in line with the premium setting or pricing. We had to ask twice for sugar for our coffee, which was served nearly five minutes later, by then, the coffee was cold. When we asked the server if sugar shouldn’t have been served with the coffee, he walked away without responding or acknowledging the lapse. This lack of basic courtesy and attentiveness was disappointing.\n\nAdditionally, guests are not allowed to record videos, which felt out of place for a heritage destination that naturally invites people to capture memories.\n\nOverall, while the location and food are excellent, the service falls short of expectations. For a restaurant located in such a prestigious setting, the guest experience—especially in terms of hospitality and staff behavior—should be much more refined and professional."

Located on Lake Pichola, the boat ride itself sets the tone with serene views of the city and surrounding palaces. The architecture is stunning, with beautifully carved marble structures, lush gardens, and an aura of royalty that transports you back in time. The evening ambiance, when the palace lights up, is absolutely breathtaking. It’s a perfect spot for photography, romantic walks, or simply soaking in the history and beauty. While food and drinks are slightly expensive, the overall experience is worth it. A must-visit landmark to complete your Udaipur trip!"

We spent some time sitting by the water. It was a very nice and fresh experience. Must visit if you are in Udaipur!\n\nJag Mandir is a small palace but very special. Watching the sunset from there is the best thing. The colors of the sky and the lake together look magical. The place is neat, and the staff was friendly.\n\nIf you love taking pictures, Jag Mandir is perfect. The building, gardens, and the lake around it make every corner look like a painting. The boat ride is short but fun. It feels like you are entering a different world."

And be warned, the restaurant is extremely expensive (to give you an idea, even a water bottle costs ₹110).\n\nIf you’re on a student trip or traveling on a budget, this might not be the best use of your time or money. You could end up spending ₹600–₹1000 on the boat ride and 3–5 hours just to visit a single palace with only a costly dining option.\n\nSo, unless you’re specifically looking for a premium experience, you may want to skip Jagmandir and explore more budget-friendly attractions in Udaipur instead."

The sheer grandeur envelops you from the moment you enter, with architecture that gracefully marries elegance and legacy. Every corridor whispers stories of a bygone era, where artistry met opulence.\nFrom the intricately carved facades to the richly adorned queen’s chambers, the palace stuns with its attention to detail. Personal belongings preserved through time add an intimate touch, bridging centuries in quiet reverence. The interiors are not just aesthetically beautiful—they’re deeply immersive, offering a glimpse into royal life that feels almost tangible.\nI highly recommend taking a guided tour—not only for the deeper historical insights but also for discovering the hidden corners perfect for photographs. Every nook holds a narrative, and with the right guide, those stories truly come alive.\nIf you’re visiting Udaipur, this palace is an absolute must. It’s more than a tourist attraction; it’s a soulful experience that lingers long after you've left."

From here, you get a panoramic view of the majestic City Palace, shimmering Lake Pichola, and the stunning reflections of the palaces, ghats, and heritage buildings across the water. It’s the perfect place to take in the royal beauty of the city—all in one frame.\n\nI first visited during the day and was mesmerized by the peaceful vibes, the cool breeze from the lake, and the sound of temple bells in the background. There are several small temples around the ghat, adding a spiritual and serene charm to the area.\n\nThe walk to Ambrai Ghat from Gangaur Ghat is an experience in itself. You cross a lovely walking bridge decorated with beautiful poles and lamps, offering picturesque views along the way. It feels like walking through a postcard scene.\n\nLater at night, I went back hoping to catch the palace beautifully lit up—but the main entrance to the ghat was closed. However, I found a perfect alternative: you can still enjoy the same mesmerizing night view by entering through the Ambrai Ghat Restaurant. The restaurant offers direct access to the lakefront with the same iconic view—ideal for dinner with a royal backdrop.\n\nIf you’re visiting Udaipur, Ambrai Ghat is a must-see. Whether it’s for the peaceful morning lake view or the sparkling lights of the City Palace at night, it’s an unforgettable experience. Don’t miss it—walk, sit, click photos, or just breathe in the charm of Udaipur from this beautiful spot."

Sadly, the sky was cloudy that morning, so we missed it—but honestly, the view was still totally worth it! You can see the whole city from up there, and it’s even visible from Fateh Sagar Lake.\n\nThe drive itself was nice—we took our own car and stopped at a few beautiful spots on the way just to soak it all in. Parking cost us ₹350, and the entry fee for the wildlife area was ₹140 per person. If you don’t have your own vehicle, you can hire a taxi that takes you right up to the palace.\n\nThe greenery around the wildlife sanctuary was lovely, and once you reach the top, the view of the mountains and city from the rooftop just takes your breath away. The palace, that is in Wildlife sanctuary built back in the 1800s, is really well maintained. It’s a peaceful place—you can sit for a while, relax, and take some great photos.\n\nIf you’re planning to visit, I’d definitely recommend going either early in the morning or later in the evening. It opens at 9 AM and closes at 6 PM, but it gets quite crowded in the middle of the day. Also, avoid going during the peak summer heat—it gets really hot and hazy, and you won’t enjoy the view as much.\n\nOne tip: carry some water and a few snacks. There is a restaurant inside, but it’s a bit expensive, so better to eat before you go or just keep something handy.\n\nGive yourself at least 2 to 3 hours to explore at a relaxed pace. It’s not the kind of place you want to rush through.\n\nAll in all, a lovely experience. If you’ve got time in Udaipur, definitely try to fit this into your plan!"

Starting from the royal welcome to the  multiple elements inside it namely the front boutique, garden, rooftop and the pool area, everything are eye-catching.\nThe staff provide an excellent service with a warm gesture and address all our requests at ease. One can easily be occupied there due to multiple view points and photogenic spots.\nThey conduct a history tour around the palace, a chargeable boat ride around pichola and Jagmandir palace and an evening traditional Rajasthani talent show.\nThey have in-house and special spa services, gym, jagguzzi and special events facilities. They have beautiful themes restaurants, bar and roof-top dining options at different pay-scale. The morning breakfast with lake view was still memorable!\nDefinitely penny-worth stay in this beautiful palace will leave you with heart-filled memories to cherish."

While our session was quick and we were briefly explained everything at once, the larger group received much more attention. Their waiter stayed at their table, explaining each dish and guiding them through the meal, whereas our waiter left immediately after the initial explanation.\n\nWhile the food itself was excellent, a more balanced service approach would have made the experience much better for smaller groups like ours.\n\nGood experience could have been better."

The dal baati churma is delicious but what steals the show is their traditional rajasthani thali.\n\nThe waiters and their hospitality is outstanding. The way they explain their dishes and make you eat the way it’s supposed to be done is commendable. What stands out is their gatte ki bhaji and one more bhaji whose name I don’t remember. The thali is heavy, flavourful and expensive. So please go only if you’re extremely hungry.\n\nThe waiter was continuously pouring desi ghee on my dal baati churma. It is their kind behaviour and gesture which makes you eat till you burppppppp.\n\nThey have ample parking space outside. Better to go around 19:00 hrs to get the best parking spot. The thali cost me ₹800 and Dal baati cost me ₹600 excl taxes.\n\nI am definitely going to recommend and come back to this place for their thali. Much love people. Cutting 1 star only only for the ambience which is now getting old."

If it’s supposed to be unlimited, at least give people some time to enjoy and taste everything. They told us how to eat each item, rushed us through the entire meal, and straight to dessert. After being served dessert, how can anyone go back and eat roti? The waiters were also a bit odd in their behavior, which made the whole experience feel uncomfortable."

Told me that there are only 5-7 cars there, when in reality there are 20 cars. Not sure why he didn’t want me to go there.\nI’ve had it with these private taxi drivers and their owners. Two bad experiences in Rajasthan are enough to never want to rent a car and driver again.\nThey just want your money and couldn’t care less about customer service. It’s aggravating."

It was very disappointing. The room was too cool and it was difficult for them to adjust. I didn’t like the coconut scrub at all. The scrub was left on and you were tightly wrapped which felt cold and uncomfortable. I felt claustrophobic (and had said I suffer from claustrophobia on the form) but she didnt seem to take note of this. I eventually freed my arms. It wasn’t relaxing at all. The massage didn’t focus enough on back and shoulders which I’d also requested on the form. The facial was good but by this time I wanted it to be over. I felt I was lying in the same position for too long and needed some respite during the 2hr40mins. Very expensive for a less than satisfactory experience."

The moment you step through its grand entrance, you are greeted by an atmosphere of peace that stands in sharp contrast to the bustling city streets just outside.\n\nThe temple’s intricate carvings are simply mesmerizing, telling stories from ancient times with astonishing detail. Every pillar and corner showcases the remarkable craftsmanship of the artisans who built it nearly 400 years ago. As you climb the elegant marble steps, the energy shifts — it’s almost as if time slows down to let you soak in the spiritual vibe.\n\nThe idol of Lord Vishnu (in the form of Jagannath) at the sanctum is stunning and radiates a serene, almost magnetic presence. Morning and evening aartis (prayer rituals) add an extra layer of magic to the experience, filling the temple with soulful chants and the fragrance of incense.\n\nWhat truly sets Jagdish Temple apart is how seamlessly it blends into the life of Udaipur — it's a living, breathing part of the city’s soul. Whether you're a devotee, a history lover, or simply an explorer seeking hidden gems, this temple promises a deeply enriching experience.\n\nIf you’re in Udaipur, a visit to Jagdish Temple isn’t just recommended — it’s essential."

This is an exceptional example of Rajput architecture.\nMandir ko banane ka maksad sirf bhakti nahi tha, balki Mewar ki shaan aur kala ki takat dikhana bhi tha.\nThe temple has 50 beautifully carved pillars which is just wow, what a wonder.\n\nThe evening aarti at Jagdish Mandir is truly a divine experience. The lamps, the sound of temple bells, and the chants of devotees create a powerful and peaceful atmosphere that you really have to feel for yourself.\n\nThe location of Jagdish Mandir is also super convenient it's right in the heart of Udaipur. You won’t just visit the temple, but also get the chance to explore some amazing nearby spots like\n* Lake pichola (just a short walk or you can take auto/taxi, etc.)\n* city palace (literally walking distance from the maintemple)\n* Hathi pol & ashwini bazar (market famous for local art and handicraft)\n* Gangaur ghat (a ghat which is a great place to explore from there you'll see the iconic city palace's view).\n\nPlus, since the temple is located in the Old City, you’ll find some really charming cafes in the narrow lanes perfect for grabbing a bite or coffee after sightseeing. The whole area is quite popular amongst the tourists, so you’ll always see a lively vibe with travelers exploring the streets and having the best time."

Intricate carvings, beautifully done ceilings, and walls that felt like storybooks. The temple is a three-story structure, with the main shrine dedicated to Lord Vishnu. And while we don’t really know much about temples or the deeper meanings behind everything, we do know good architecture when we see it—and this one was something else.\n\nThe walls are painted with scenes from Hindu mythology—Ramayana, Mahabharata, all of it—and even without knowing every reference, it’s hard not to be impressed. Everything looked so carefully crafted, like someone had poured their entire soul into every detail.\n\nWe took over a hundred pictures, not even kidding. These are just a few clicks we decided to post, but trust us, we could’ve made a whole photo album out of it. If you’re even a little into architecture or historical design, this place is a must-visit.\n\nAlso—major plus—it’s free. No entry fee, no fancy ticket. It’s a temple, open to all, which just adds to how cool and accessible it feels.\n\nOnly reason we’re giving it 4 stars instead of 5? The maintenance. Or rather, the lack of it. It’s honestly sad to see something this beautiful, something people actively worship, just not being taken care of. The structure deserves so much more respect. The government seriously needs to wake up and put some effort into preserving places like this. If you’re gonna call it cultural heritage, then treat it like one."

You can enter from the City Palace side, where you need to buy a ticket for the boat ride. The boat ride is one of the best experiences you can have — the calm water, the cool breeze, and the amazing view of old buildings and the sunset make it unforgettable.\n\nThe boat also stops at Jag Mandir, which is a beautiful place to walk around and click some great pictures. The only thing I didn’t like was the food at Jag Mandir — it’s way too expensive. But apart from that, Lake Pichola is truly a place that feels like another world. A must-visit when you are in Udaipur!"

Surrounded by stunning architecture like the City Palace, Jag Mandir, and the Lake Palace, it offers a picture-perfect view that feels straight out of a postcard. I spent quite some time just walking along the lakefront near the City Palace, and every angle felt like it was made to be photographed.\n\nWhat makes the lake so special is the way it reflects the colors of the sky—especially during sunrise and sunset. The changing hues, combined with the calm water and the majestic palaces floating in the middle, create an almost dream-like atmosphere. I took a boat ride during sunset, and it was honestly the best decision. Passing by Jag Mandir with the City Palace glowing in the background was just unforgettable.There’s a certain peace to being by Lake Pichola. Even with tourists around, it doesn’t feel chaotic. The breeze, the soft sounds of water, and the views make it a perfect spot to slow down and just take it all in.\n\nIf you’re in Udaipur, don’t miss this. Whether you’re exploring the palaces nearby or just enjoying a quiet evening by the ghats, Lake Pichola truly captures the soul of the city."

Built in 1362 AD, it’s surrounded by palaces, temples, ghats, and scenic hills, making it one of the most romantic and iconic places in Rajasthan.\n\n---\n\n🌊 Highlights:\n\nBoat Ride Experience: The boat ride (especially at sunset) is magical. It offers stunning views of the City Palace, Jag Mandir, Taj Lake Palace, and the surrounding hills.\n\nPalaces on the Water:\n\nJag Mandir – open for visitors with a royal feel.\n\nLake Palace (Taj Hotel) – visible from the boat, known for its heritage charm.\n\nScenic Surroundings: Aravalli hills, old havelis, and historic ghats like Gangaur Ghat add to the lake’s timeless beauty.\n\nBest Views: Ambrai Ghat, Lal Ghat, City Palace, and from rooftop cafés.\n\n---\n\n✅ Pros:\n\nMesmerizing views, especially during sunrise and sunset.\n\nPeaceful ambiance ideal for couples, families, and photographers.\n\nBoat ride is well-organized and gives a full experience.\n\nLots of scenic spots nearby (ghats, temples, cafés).\n\n---\n\n❌ Cons:\n\nBoat rides can be a bit pricey (₹400–₹800 depending on type and time).\n\nCrowded during weekends and peak tourist season.\n\nLimited public seating around the lake.\n\n---\n\n💡 Tips:\n\nSunset boat ride is the best — golden light + cool breeze.\n\nVisit Ambrai Ghat for peaceful lake views and evening photography.\n\nIf on a budget, skip the palace entry and just enjoy the ghats.\n\n---\n\n⭐ Final Verdict:\n\nLake Pichola is the soul of Udaipur — calm, romantic, and regal.

There were long queues, and even with two separate lines (possibly for ticket types), the wait was too much — so we ended up skipping the boat ride.\n\nStill, we didn’t want to miss the iconic sunset view, and honestly, it didn’t disappoint. The golden hour reflecting off the water with views of the City Palace, Jag Mandir, and Taj Lake Palace in the middle of the lake was absolutely magical.\n\nBoating prices vary:\n• We selected ₹200 one, because there was long wait in other slots.\n\nAround ₹400–₹600 per person for regular boat rides\n\n₹800–₹1000 for sunset or evening slots (private boats cost more)\n\nAlso, there's a man who has a telescope so you can see the view which charges ₹20 to ₹50 per person. There are a lot many snacks counters where you can buy but while entering the boat they don't allow the food, so make sure to avoid carrying any.\n\nIf you really want to experience it without the rush, try visiting on a weekday or early morning. Even without boating, just sitting by the lake and soaking in the views is worth it."

              "reviewText": "Visiting this palace was like stepping into a living tapestry of India’s regal past. The sheer grandeur envelops you from the moment you enter, with architecture that gracefully marries elegance and legacy. Every corridor whispers stories of a bygone era, where artistry met opulence.\nFrom the intricately carved facades to the richly adorned queen’s chambers, the palace stuns with its attention to detail. Personal belongings preserved through time add an intimate touch, bridging centuries in quiet reverence. The interiors are not just aesthetically beautiful—they’re deeply immersive, offering a glimpse into royal life that feels almost tangible.\nI highly recommend taking a guided tour—not only for the deeper historical insights but also for discovering the hidden corners perfect for photographs. Every nook holds a narrative, and with the right guide, those stories truly come alive.\nIf you’re visiting Udaipur, this palace is an absolute must. It’s more than a tourist attraction; it’s a soulful experience that lingers long after you've left."

During weekends it gets very crowded and some sections of the palace are very narrow, thus it will feel suffocating. There is continuous series of exhibits in the palace so if you get bored midway it might be difficult to get out. There are quite beautiful views of the city. There's a restaurant inside the palace too."

It’s the kind of place where you can truly slow down and enjoy your time. The best part? It only costs ₹40 per person, which is a total steal for how serene and pretty it is.\n\nYes, like many public spaces, some people still litter—but the staff here does a great job cleaning up and preserving the beauty of the space.\n\nThis part isn’t just about the garden, but we feel it needs to be said: even if you have a small platform, use it to spread the message. Please be responsible when you’re out in public. Carry a small bag, collect your trash, and dispose of it properly. It’s such a small thing, but it makes a huge difference.\n\nHappy holidaying—and let’s keep our shared spaces beautiful."

From here, you get a panoramic view of the majestic City Palace, shimmering Lake Pichola, and the stunning reflections of the palaces, ghats, and heritage buildings across the water. It’s the perfect place to take in the royal beauty of the city—all in one frame.\n\nI first visited during the day and was mesmerized by the peaceful vibes, the cool breeze from the lake, and the sound of temple bells in the background. There are several small temples around the ghat, adding a spiritual and serene charm to the area.\n\nThe walk to Ambrai Ghat from Gangaur Ghat is an experience in itself. You cross a lovely walking bridge decorated with beautiful poles and lamps, offering picturesque views along the way. It feels like walking through a postcard scene.\n\nLater at night, I went back hoping to catch the palace beautifully lit up—but the main entrance to the ghat was closed. However, I found a perfect alternative: you can still enjoy the same mesmerizing night view by entering through the Ambrai Ghat Restaurant. The restaurant offers direct access to the lakefront with the same iconic view—ideal for dinner with a royal backdrop.\n\nIf you’re visiting Udaipur, Ambrai Ghat is a must-see. Whether it’s for the peaceful morning lake view or the sparkling lights of the City Palace at night, it’s an unforgettable experience. Don’t miss it—walk, sit, click photos, or just breathe in the charm of Udaipur from this beautiful spot."

The view here is stunning, with the City Palace on one side, the shimmering lake in front, and a sky that turns full drama mode during sunset. It’s the kind of spot where you just sit and go silent for a second, because wow.\n\nThat said, peace is a myth here after a point. It gets really crowded—tourists, photographers, couples doing pre-wedding shoots, influencers balancing on railings—you name it. So if you’re chasing that quiet, introspective lake moment, this might not be your place unless you come super early or opt for a boat ride. The view from the lake during sunset is supposed to be unreal. We skipped the boat ride though—been there, done that, and to be honest, unless there’s a little thrill (maybe white water rafting?), it doesn’t excite us anymore. We like our adventures loud.\n\nAmbrai Ghat also has one of the best vantage points to photograph the City Palace lit up after dark. If you’re into night photography or just want to sit with your thoughts (and 50 other people doing the same), this is the spot. It’s public, it’s free, and it gives you all the postcard vibes of Udaipur in one frame.\n\nFinal take? It’s iconic, it’s beautiful, it’s chaotic—but it’s Udaipur. You go. You just time it smartly."

This palace is totally made for the sunset view. I visited here in march end week and I missed the sunset view from the karni mata mandir. But caught the full 🌇 sunset view at this palace.\n\nThe price can be feel bit high but truly worth it. Here, you can go by your own vehicle or by buying ticket for car service that will provide take and drop service.\n\nNote: If you took their vehicle service don't lost the ticket as the contact details are written on the ticket only. So , if you missed the last car while enjoying till bit late. So you can contact them and they will come to pick you. But try to come back till 6pm last after that you will not get auto or any online service as this place is far from local areas."

              "reviewText": "Beautiful Location, Especially During Monsoon But a Bit Overpriced..\n\nMonsoon Palace is located on a hill surrounded by lush greenery, offering breathtaking views especially during the monsoon season, when its natural beauty multiplies. The road leading to the top is about 4 km long, steep, and winding, making it more suitable for experienced drivers.\nAuto-rickshaws are not allowed, so visitors must either use their own vehicle or a government-approved cab. At the top, there's a small restaurant where you can enjoy coffee and snacks amidst scenic views and cool, refreshing winds.\nFrom the palace, you get a panoramic view of Udaipur city, which is truly mesmerizing and peaceful. The palace also features a small wildlife exhibit and an interactive projector where you can see yourself amidst wild animals—a fun experience, though nothing extraordinary.\nYou should plan to spend at least an hour exploring the place. However, I felt the entry ticket (₹174 per person) is a bit overpriced for what’s offered. Also, personal car parking costs ₹338, which is quite expensive and should be reviewed by the authorities.\n\nOverall, the place is worth visiting for nature lovers and photographers, especially during the rainy season but be prepared for the high charges."

It was monsoon season, so the entire place was wrapped in mist and rain, making it feel like something out of a dream. I forgot to carry an umbrella, but honestly, the beauty of the place made up for it. The cool breeze, the soft drizzle, and the breathtaking views were just unforgettable.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys hiking, this destination is definitely worth adding to your list. The trails are scenic, peaceful, and offer some incredible photo opportunities.\n\nOne word of advice: if you're not a regular or confident driver, I highly recommend hiring a local driver. The roads leading up to the hill station are quite steep, with sharp turns and narrow stretches that can be challenging to navigate, especially in the rain. Local drivers are experienced with these routes and will make your journey safer and more comfortable.\n\nOverall, it was a magical trip, and I’d absolutely go back—just with an umbrella next time!"

Also you can pay ₹10 to have Corn 🌽 seeds and try luring Pigeons 🐦 and some some photos with them.\n\nApart from this there nothing else you can do here. If not crowded then you might find some peace sitting on the lake side."

The approach through the narrow lanes adds a touch of charm and makes the journey feel like an exploration of the old city. Once you reach, the ghat offers a peaceful ambiance where you can sit, relax, and soak in the atmosphere. It’s a wonderful place to spend quality time with family, watch the boats pass by, and enjoy the blend of heritage and serenity that the ghat is known for. The experience feels even more special in the evening when the surroundings become quieter and the beauty of the lake comes alive."

Known for its cultural and historical significance, this ghat offers stunning views of Jag Mandir, City Palace, and the calm waters of the lake, especially during sunrise and sunset.\n\nThe place holds a special vibe, with heritage havelis like Bagore Ki Haveli nearby adding to the old-world charm. In the evenings, locals and tourists gather here to unwind, click photographs, or simply enjoy the tranquil beauty of Udaipur’s lakescape. The reflection of palaces and boats in the lake’s shimmering waters creates a postcard-worthy scene.\n\nBest time to visit: Early morning or around sunset for beautiful lighting and peaceful surroundings.\n\nSpecial highlight: During the Gangaur Festival, this ghat becomes a lively hub of traditional processions, decorated boats, and cultural performances — offering a peek into Udaipur’s vibrant traditions.\n\nPros:\n\nScenic views of Lake Pichola\n\nClose to heritage attractions\n\nGreat for photography and quiet moments\n\nCons:\n\nCan get crowded during peak tourist hours\n\nLimited cleanliness at times"

As you climb the elegant marble steps, the energy shifts — it’s almost as if time slows down to let you soak in the spiritual vibe.\n\nThe idol of Lord Vishnu (in the form of Jagannath) at the sanctum is stunning and radiates a serene, almost magnetic presence. Morning and evening aartis (prayer rituals) add an extra layer of magic to the experience, filling the temple with soulful chants and the fragrance of incense.\n\nWhat truly sets Jagdish Temple apart is how seamlessly it blends into the life of Udaipur — it's a living, breathing part of the city’s soul. Whether you're a devotee, a history lover, or simply an explorer seeking hidden gems, this temple promises a deeply enriching experience.\n\nIf you’re in Udaipur, a visit to Jagdish Temple isn’t just recommended — it’s essential."

Intricate carvings, beautifully done ceilings, and walls that felt like storybooks. The temple is a three-story structure, with the main shrine dedicated to Lord Vishnu. And while we don’t really know much about temples or the deeper meanings behind everything, we do know good architecture when we see it—and this one was something else.\n\nThe walls are painted with scenes from Hindu mythology—Ramayana, Mahabharata, all of it—and even without knowing every reference, it’s hard not to be impressed. Everything looked so carefully crafted, like someone had poured their entire soul into every detail.\n\nWe took over a hundred pictures, not even kidding. These are just a few clicks we decided to post, but trust us, we could’ve made a whole photo album out of it. If you’re even a little into architecture or historical design, this place is a must-visit.\n\nAlso—major plus—it’s free. No entry fee, no fancy ticket. It’s a temple, open to all, which just adds to how cool and accessible it feels.\n\nOnly reason we’re giving it 4 stars instead of 5? The maintenance. Or rather, the lack of it. It’s honestly sad to see something this beautiful, something people actively worship, just not being taken care of. The structure deserves so much more respect. The government seriously needs to wake up and put some effort into preserving places like this. If you’re gonna call it cultural heritage, then treat it like one."

The architecture of the temple is stunning and the spirituality that was connected from all the visitors who sat inside the temple, singing hymns, is something worth mentioning. While the way to reach the place is definitely not elderly friendly, I would highly suggest taking an auto down (if up isn’t possible) to avoid further stress of the sloped walk up!"

Another island features a solar observatory, and the third is home to a public park with lush greenery. Boating is a must-do activity here, with options ranging from pedal boats to motorboats, allowing visitors to experience the calm waters and panoramic views.\n\nEvenings at Fateh Sagar are especially mesmerizing. The lakeside promenade, lined with food stalls and local vendors, comes alive with people enjoying snacks, photography, and the cool breeze.

              "reviewText": "Bagore Ki Haveli is one of the most memorable places I visited in Udaipur. Located right near Gangaur Ghat and overlooking Lake Pichola, it gives off a very authentic Rajasthani vibe. The haveli itself is beautifully restored and has over 100 rooms filled with old photographs, costumes, weapons, royal artifacts, and some really intricate mirror and glass work.The best part for me was the evening cultural show (Dharohar) held in the courtyard—absolutely worth attending! Traditional Rajasthani folk dances, puppetry, and live music performances made it super lively and entertaining. The dancers were amazing, especially the woman who balanced multiple pots on her head—so talented! Pro tip: reach at least 30–45 minutes early to get front row seats because it gets crowded fast.I also enjoyed exploring the different parts of the haveli, like the royal bedroom, women’s quarters, and balconies with stunning views of the lake. The ticket prices are very reasonable (₹60 for Indians + ₹150 camera fee, approx), and it feels like a great value for the experience.It’s located in the Old City, so the streets are narrow, and it’s better to walk or take a tuk-tuk instead of driving. You can easily visit Jagdish Temple or take a boat ride nearby after this. Bagore Ki Haveli is a must-visit if you’re in Udaipur and love history, culture, or just want to see something different and real."

The ticket is priced at ₹125 per person, and if you wish to use your phone camera to take photos or record videos, there’s an additional ₹125 charge. I highly recommend paying this extra amount — it’s a small way to show respect for the artists and the incredible effort put into preserving and showcasing Rajasthan's rich cultural heritage.\n\nThe cultural show runs from 7 PM to 8 PM, and tickets are available starting at 6 PM. I suggest entering the museum by 6:30 PM to grab a front-row seat.\n\nOverall, Bagore Ki Haveli is a place you shouldn’t miss, especially the cultural performance — it’s absolutely worth it."

If you are seeking a meaningful and enriching exploration of Udaipur's history and heritage, there are more captivating attractions to prioritize over the Ahar Cenotaphs."

              "reviewText": "The Darikhana Restaurant at Jagmandir Island Palace is undeniably beautiful. The setting is stunning, with peaceful views of Lake Pichola and the palace architecture providing a picturesque backdrop for a fine dining experience. The food was impressive, especially the Lotus Stem Annar ki Bhel and the Subz Biryani, both of which were flavorful and thoughtfully prepared. The biryani was aromatic, well-balanced, and served with care.\n\nHowever, the service was not in line with the premium setting or pricing. We had to ask twice for sugar for our coffee, which was served nearly five minutes later, by then, the coffee was cold. When we asked the server if sugar shouldn’t have been served with the coffee, he walked away without responding or acknowledging the lapse. This lack of basic courtesy and attentiveness was disappointing.\n\nAdditionally, guests are not allowed to record videos, which felt out of place for a heritage destination that naturally invites people to capture memories.\n\nOverall, while the location and food are excellent, the service falls short of expectations. For a restaurant located in such a prestigious setting, the guest experience—especially in terms of hospitality and staff behavior—should be much more refined and professional."

Located on Lake Pichola, the boat ride itself sets the tone with serene views of the city and surrounding palaces. The architecture is stunning, with beautifully carved marble structures, lush gardens, and an aura of royalty that transports you back in time. The evening ambiance, when the palace lights up, is absolutely breathtaking. It’s a perfect spot for photography, romantic walks, or simply soaking in the history and beauty. While food and drinks are slightly expensive, the overall experience is worth it. A must-visit landmark to complete your Udaipur trip!"

Everything is quite expensive too.\n\nTo reach here, you have to take a boat ride, which takes you around the lake before dropping you at Jagmandir. That ride itself is a good experience.\n\nFor the evening slot, price is 800₹ per person."

Located just a few kilometers from the city center, it houses the cenotaphs (chhatris) of the Maharanas of Mewar along with an archaeological museum that gives a deep insight into Rajasthan's royal and ancient heritage.\n\nThe museum part has an interesting collection of artifacts dating back to 4000 years — including pottery, sculptures, and tools from the ancient Ahar civilization. It's a walk through time, especially if you’re into archaeology.\n\nUdaipur isn’t just about lakes and palaces — Ahar Museum is proof of the city’s ancient depth and royal soul.

The tanks are well-maintained and the environment is family-friendly. However, the experience may feel underwhelming for adults, especially considering the high ticket prices, which don’t quite match the overall scale or uniqueness of the exhibit.\n\nVisit this place only if you’re with children, as they are more likely to enjoy the colorful displays and interactive features. Otherwise, there are better-value attractions in Udaipur for adults or solo travelers."

Don't book Uber/Ola directly to the top as some drivers will only drop you to the bottom of the park citing various reasons ranging from only park vehicles are allowed up, vehicle toll too much, dangerous to drive up, everyone pays  the full fare even when we drop them down here(we got all the above reasons from our Uber driver who left us stranded at the bottom gave all the above reasons so am listing them out.\n\nNote: The road is motorable and many private vehicles go up and down.\nYou can pay the toll for the private cabs and can drive in.\nIf you get dropped at the bottom, then you can walk across the road to the main entrance of the park and book van tickets to the top and back, usually around 50Rs per head. The park vans will drop everyone up and down without any hassle.\n\nThere is a cafe on the top, so you can get something to eat, munch and drink right there enjoying the beautiful views and sunsets. Usually people visit during sunrises and sunsets since these are spectacular to view from the fort.\n\nNote: Lots of langurs around. Please don't take eatables in your hands and offer these to the animals. Also please don't litter these historical places, lets leave them clean and beautiful as always."

Spread over 36 hectares, the park was established in 2015 to provide a safe habitat for a diverse range of flora and fauna, many of which are native to the Aravalli ecosystem. Its location at the foothills of the historic Sajjangarh Palace, or Monsoon Palace, provides a dramatic and picturesque backdrop to the sanctuary.\nThe park is home to over 60 animals from 21 species, offering visitors a chance to see majestic creatures like Bengal tigers, lions, leopards, and sloth bears. Other inhabitants include various species of deer, such as chital and sambar, as well as hyenas, crocodiles, and a variety of birds. The enclosures are designed to mimic the animals' natural environment, providing a more authentic viewing experience.\nVisitors can explore the park on foot, rent a bicycle, or opt for a golf cart tour. Beyond the animal enclosures, the park's undulating terrain and lush greenery, particularly during the monsoon season, make for a scenic and tranquil escape from the city. The park also plays a crucial role in wildlife education and conservation, with facilities like a zoo hospital and a nutrition center. Its innovative use of an augmented reality application enhances the visitor experience, promoting wildlife tourism and a deeper understanding of the local biodiversity. Sajjangarh Biological Park stands as a testament to the region's commitment to protecting its rich natural heritage."

This well-maintained park is a perfect retreat from the hustle and bustle of city life, offering lush greenery and a tranquil ambiance that instantly puts you at ease. The sprawling gardens, dotted with vibrant flower beds and ancient trees, create a picturesque setting ideal for a leisurely stroll, a quiet read, or simply soaking in the natural beauty. 🌸🌳\n\nOne of the highlights of the park is its well-planned layout, with plenty of seating areas where you can relax and enjoy the view. The calm atmosphere makes it a great spot for families, couples, or anyone looking to unwind. There are also small ponds and fountains that add to the charm and provide a refreshing contrast to the surrounding greenery.\n\nWhile the park is beautiful, it could benefit from a few additional amenities like better lighting in some areas and more frequent maintenance in certain spots. However, these minor issues do not detract significantly from the overall experience. The staff on duty were friendly and ensured that visitors had a safe and pleasant time during their visit.\nOverall, Gulab Bagh Park in Udaipur is a delightful oasis that I would highly recommend to both locals and tourists. Whether you’re looking for a peaceful spot to relax or a scenic backdrop for your photography, this park has something to offer. It’s a reminder of the simple pleasures of nature right in the heart of the city. Highly recommended for a dose of calm and beauty in Udaipur!"

And there are two ways to reach there, either through stairs or through the ropeway.\nThe ropeway activity is a very popular and one of the must visit things to do in udaipur. It provides breathtaking view of udaipur, it's lake, palace and the city from the top.\nThere is a lot of rush for ropeway usually and you need to wait for approximately an hour for your turn and similarly while returning you will have to wait. But if you have time, it is a very good way to enjoy the view greenry, hills as well as it provides the darshan of Mata karni ji.\n\nI would recommed the overall experience worth your time.\n\nThe place also has eateries where you can wait and satisfy your hunger."

              "reviewText": "Beautiful Location, Especially During Monsoon But a Bit Overpriced..\n\nMonsoon Palace is located on a hill surrounded by lush greenery, offering breathtaking views especially during the monsoon season, when its natural beauty multiplies. The road leading to the top is about 4 km long, steep, and winding, making it more suitable for experienced drivers.\nAuto-rickshaws are not allowed, so visitors must either use their own vehicle or a government-approved cab. At the top, there's a small restaurant where you can enjoy coffee and snacks amidst scenic views and cool, refreshing winds.\nFrom the palace, you get a panoramic view of Udaipur city, which is truly mesmerizing and peaceful. The palace also features a small wildlife exhibit and an interactive projector where you can see yourself amidst wild animals—a fun experience, though nothing extraordinary.\nYou should plan to spend at least an hour exploring the place. However, I felt the entry ticket (₹174 per person) is a bit overpriced for what’s offered. Also, personal car parking costs ₹338, which is quite expensive and should be reviewed by the authorities.\n\nOverall, the place is worth visiting for nature lovers and photographers, especially during the rainy season but be prepared for the high charges."

This palace is totally made for the sunset view. I visited here in march end week and I missed the sunset view from the karni mata mandir. But caught the full 🌇 sunset view at this palace.\n\nThe price can be feel bit high but truly worth it. Here, you can go by your own vehicle or by buying ticket for car service that will provide take and drop service.\n\nNote: If you took their vehicle service don't lost the ticket as the contact details are written on the ticket only. So , if you missed the last car while enjoying till bit late. So you can contact them and they will come to pick you. But try to come back till 6pm last after that you will not get auto or any online service as this place is far from local areas."

It was monsoon season, so the entire place was wrapped in mist and rain, making it feel like something out of a dream. I forgot to carry an umbrella, but honestly, the beauty of the place made up for it. The cool breeze, the soft drizzle, and the breathtaking views were just unforgettable.\n\nIf you're someone who enjoys hiking, this destination is definitely worth adding to your list. The trails are scenic, peaceful, and offer some incredible photo opportunities.\n\nOne word of advice: if you're not a regular or confident driver, I highly recommend hiring a local driver. The roads leading up to the hill station are quite steep, with sharp turns and narrow stretches that can be challenging to navigate, especially in the rain. Local drivers are experienced with these routes and will make your journey safer and more comfortable.\n\nOverall, it was a magical trip, and I’d absolutely go back—just with an umbrella next time!"

The sky conditions at Udaipur are quite favorable for solar observations. Since the observatory is situated amidst a large mass of water, air turbulence which occurs due to ground heating by sun's rays is decreased. This improves the image quality and accuracy (average between 1-2 arc seconds).\n\nSolar Physics is one of the major areas of research at the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL). The dedicated research group in solar physics is based at the Udaipur Solar Observatory (USO) in Udaipur. The well-equipped ground-based solar observation facility at Udaipur is known globally for highest quality observational solar research. The major science goals of solar physics research group are to understand the physics of solar oscillations, evolution of sunspots, sunspot fine structure, MHD processes in the solar atmosphere, coronal heating, solar eruptions and space weather prediction. Solar research group extensively utilizes data obtained from both ground-based and space-based instruments together with numerical simulations to address key research problems in solar physics. Scientists are also involved in design, development, and operation of various ground-based and space-based instruments."

The taste of the food was amazing, especially the traditional flavors which were well-prepared and satisfying.\n\nIt was nice to see that the service has improved, but there’s still some room for better guest hospitality. The food service started early, which we appreciated, but it was left idle midway — this felt a bit out of place and not in line with the warm guest culture one expects here.\n\nThat said, the setting, food quality, and overall vibe made it a pleasant experience. Would definitely consider visiting again, hoping for more attentive service next time."

Service is great and all staff are very polite and humble.\n\nFood - not great and there are many restaurants serving more delicious food and that too, at cheaper prices. We ordered for pizza and the base was super hard and we had to send it back only to hear back that there were some issues with bakery on that day! They replaced the pizza but it tasted equally horrible. Other couple of items we had was good but definitely not great at all."

The staff was courteous, and the restaurant offers a wide multi-cuisine menu, though we found it slightly overpriced, especially the mocktails.\n\nWe ordered a Rajasthani Veg Thali, a pizza, and mocktails. While the presentation was appealing, the mocktails didn’t quite justify their price. The pizza looked good, but my son, who had it, felt it was overloaded with cheese and didn’t enjoy the crust.\n\nThe biggest letdown was the Rajasthani Thali. It came with only one chapati and no rice, which was surprising—especially for an Indian meal where rice is a staple, particularly with dishes like kadhi. Being from Chandigarh, kadhi-chawal is a must for me, and the thali just didn’t feel complete. We were informed that only one chapati is served if the thali is shared, and we had to pay extra for more, which felt unreasonable.\n\nThat said, the churma ladoo was excellent and truly stood out. Overall, while the ambiance is nice, the experience felt overrated for the price."

The experience was fantastic, especially the mirror maze, which was truly captivating. The museum features lifelike wax sculptures of world leaders and celebrities, adding to the charm. The 9D movie was also a fun and engaging experience. However, one downside was being taken to an art gallery next door at the end, which turned out to be a sales pitch—something that could have been avoided.\n\n2 wheeler parking is available. Overall, it was a great visit, and I highly recommend checking out the wax museum."

You need a vehicle to reach here and dont travel alone or in late hours as the road is vacant and no people or building near by. The route passes near the army area and may have some limit athond at times. I love udaipur board is only attraction buy it dosent worth traveling that far. Pratap park may become a good spot after some years with some shops and all. This area is very empty and its not a park as such. Some outdoor fitness equipments are available there. Its a good area for a group to have a morning or evening walk and do some basic work out at a pollution great area."

The sheer grandeur envelops you from the moment you enter, with architecture that gracefully marries elegance and legacy. Every corridor whispers stories of a bygone era, where artistry met opulence.\nFrom the intricately carved facades to the richly adorned queen’s chambers, the palace stuns with its attention to detail. Personal belongings preserved through time add an intimate touch, bridging centuries in quiet reverence. The interiors are not just aesthetically beautiful—they’re deeply immersive, offering a glimpse into royal life that feels almost tangible.\nI highly recommend taking a guided tour—not only for the deeper historical insights but also for discovering the hidden corners perfect for photographs. Every nook holds a narrative, and with the right guide, those stories truly come alive.\nIf you’re visiting Udaipur, this palace is an absolute must. It’s more than a tourist attraction; it’s a soulful experience that lingers long after you've left."

The moment you step through its grand entrance, you are greeted by an atmosphere of peace that stands in sharp contrast to the bustling city streets just outside.\n\nThe temple’s intricate carvings are simply mesmerizing, telling stories from ancient times with astonishing detail. Every pillar and corner showcases the remarkable craftsmanship of the artisans who built it nearly 400 years ago. As you climb the elegant marble steps, the energy shifts — it’s almost as if time slows down to let you soak in the spiritual vibe.\n\nThe idol of Lord Vishnu (in the form of Jagannath) at the sanctum is stunning and radiates a serene, almost magnetic presence. Morning and evening aartis (prayer rituals) add an extra layer of magic to the experience, filling the temple with soulful chants and the fragrance of incense.\n\nWhat truly sets Jagdish Temple apart is how seamlessly it blends into the life of Udaipur — it's a living, breathing part of the city’s soul. Whether you're a devotee, a history lover, or simply an explorer seeking hidden gems, this temple promises a deeply enriching experience.\n\nIf you’re in Udaipur, a visit to Jagdish Temple isn’t just recommended — it’s essential."

Intricate carvings, beautifully done ceilings, and walls that felt like storybooks. The temple is a three-story structure, with the main shrine dedicated to Lord Vishnu. And while we don’t really know much about temples or the deeper meanings behind everything, we do know good architecture when we see it—and this one was something else.\n\nThe walls are painted with scenes from Hindu mythology—Ramayana, Mahabharata, all of it—and even without knowing every reference, it’s hard not to be impressed. Everything looked so carefully crafted, like someone had poured their entire soul into every detail.\n\nWe took over a hundred pictures, not even kidding. These are just a few clicks we decided to post, but trust us, we could’ve made a whole photo album out of it. If you’re even a little into architecture or historical design, this place is a must-visit.\n\nAlso—major plus—it’s free. No entry fee, no fancy ticket. It’s a temple, open to all, which just adds to how cool and accessible it feels.\n\nOnly reason we’re giving it 4 stars instead of 5? The maintenance. Or rather, the lack of it. It’s honestly sad to see something this beautiful, something people actively worship, just not being taken care of. The structure deserves so much more respect. The government seriously needs to wake up and put some effort into preserving places like this. If you’re gonna call it cultural heritage, then treat it like one."
