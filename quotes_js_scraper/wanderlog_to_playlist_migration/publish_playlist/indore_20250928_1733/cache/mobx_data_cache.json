In 1905, the grand opening of the hall was officiated by George V, the Prince of Wales, with a total cost amounting to ₹2,50,000. The architectural style is Indo-Gothic, featuring white stones from Seoni and red stones from Patan, both in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nIn 1948, H. H. Yeshwant Rao Holkar II renamed the hall as Gandhi Hall in honor of Mahatma Gandhi after a gap of 50 years. The recent renovation under the ‘Smart City Indore’ project in 2021 restored the hall to its original grandeur. The interiors now boast marble flooring, a wooden stage, captivating paintings on the walls, and a meticulously restored clock tower."

The staff was also extremely rude, and during my visit there were no lights, making the whole palace feel like an abandoned horror house.\n\nI can guarantee that once you visit, you won’t feel like coming back again. Instead of wasting your time here, I would recommend visiting the Vaishnav Mata Mandir nearby—it’s a far better experience and much more enjoyable.\n\nTicket price: ₹20.\n\nCurrently, the palace is also under renovation, which makes the entire place even messier and less appealing. Hopefully, once the restoration is completed, the palace will look more attractive, and the authorities will also work on improving staff behavior—guiding visitors politely rather than ignoring them straight to their face."

The majestic architecture, blending Maratha grandeur with Mughal elegance, instantly transported me to a bygone era. The intricate wooden balconies, giant arched gateways, and detailed carvings are absolutely breathtaking - a true architectural gem in the heart of Indore.\nWhat made the visit truly magical was seeing the palace illuminated at night. The lighting transforms the entire structure into a glowing monument, highlighting its regal charm and creating a serene yet majestic atmosphere. It’s a perfect spot for photography lovers, history buffs, or anyone who appreciates beauty and culture.\nWhether you're visiting during the day or just taking an evening walk nearby, Rajwada is not to be missed. A stunning blend of history, beauty, and Indore’s rich heritage, especially unforgettable under the evening lights."

Considered as one of the critical points of interest in Indore, The White Church gives you a look at the British impact in Indore, preceding autonomy. Worked in 1858, this congregation is one of the most established in the city and radiates a kind of peacefulness that attracts guests to this place. The structure shows European design, and is an incredible sight amid propitious celebrations like Christmas. The whole church is finished and lit up and the very air here shouts of satisfaction and festivity. In case you're looking for quietness, this is the place you should go too."

The staff was also extremely rude, and during my visit there were no lights, making the whole palace feel like an abandoned horror house.\n\nI can guarantee that once you visit, you won’t feel like coming back again. Instead of wasting your time here, I would recommend visiting the Vaishnav Mata Mandir nearby—it’s a far better experience and much more enjoyable.\n\nTicket price: ₹20.\n\nCurrently, the palace is also under renovation, which makes the entire place even messier and less appealing. Hopefully, once the restoration is completed, the palace will look more attractive, and the authorities will also work on improving staff behavior—guiding visitors politely rather than ignoring them straight to their face."

The hall in the 1st floor describes the story of Ahilyabai Holkar through miniatures. It is very interesting to see the pots and other things used by the Holkar dynasty before independence. The palace also houses a temple dedicated to their kuldevi. Overall for history enthusiasts, it will be a place to experience the lifestyle of holkars. Due to its proximity to sarafa bazaar, one can explore this palace along with their visit to the bazaar."

Got to see few historical things and we had @amay.gite with us, so it was a great experience as he shared the history behind the coins, copper plates and inscriptions that we were looking. Few things could have be improved like they have placed coins sticker instead of original coins, they have made charts just like a 5th class school project. This could be removed and a more detailed and enhanced things could be placed for a better study. You would get a lot of things from Maratha empire period specifically Holkars and Shindes there Canons, coins, guns, etc. Overall Good experience"

It all feels very random, like just a display and not a museum.\nI wish they included the story behind exhibits instead of just writing coin next to coins and swords next to swords, there’s no narrative being set. Honestly a collaboration with a school where they put in the missing material and story will improve the museum by many times."

There are a lot of sculptures at the entrance of the museum, the ticket price is a mere 20 rupees and you can witness the treasures of history in these artifacts. I enjoyed my time here, there are detailed descriptions about the paintings and the sculptures. Most of the sculptures are from mandsaur. There is a separate section for coins and for fire arms.\nThe museum is clean but it isn't highly modernised, it needs an integration with the technology to make it more appealing to the general public. Some of the glasses are cracked, the sculptures in the out have not been well kept and one can notice spiders and other insects making a home in them. The garden was unkept and the plants were not taken care of."

The museum is particularly notable for its exquisite Parmar-era sculptures, ancient coins, weapons, and architectural remains. Highlights include a red-brick Vishnu temple model and a stunning sculpture of the Jain Tirthankara Adinath.\n\nThe museum consists of two galleries: one displaying prehistoric tools and ornaments, and another dedicated to Hindu mythological carvings and medieval sculptures. Despite its impressive collection, some visitors feel the museum could benefit from better maintenance and more detailed descriptions of the exhibits.\n\nEntry is affordable at ₹20 for Indians, and it’s a quiet spot to explore Indore’s cultural heritage.

Yet, I noticed many visitors were too focused on sneaking pictures, missing the actual beauty before their eyes. It felt like they were bound to their cameras, not present in the moment.\n\nI sincerely request you — when you visit, put your phone away and just look. Take in every corner, every detail. The mirror work inside is absolutely stunning — so eye-catching and extraordinary, it leaves a lasting impression on your heart.\n\nThis temple is not just about what you see — it’s about what you feel.\nTrust me, the memories you make with your own eyes will be far more precious than anything your camera can capture."

              "reviewText": "Constructed in 1904 by the acclaimed architect Charles Frederick Stevens from Mumbai, Gandhi Hall was initially named King Edward Hall. In 1905, the grand opening of the hall was officiated by George V, the Prince of Wales, with a total cost amounting to ₹2,50,000. The architectural style is Indo-Gothic, featuring white stones from Seoni and red stones from Patan, both in Madhya Pradesh.\n\nIn 1948, H. H. Yeshwant Rao Holkar II renamed the hall as Gandhi Hall in honor of Mahatma Gandhi after a gap of 50 years. The recent renovation under the ‘Smart City Indore’ project in 2021 restored the hall to its original grandeur. The interiors now boast marble flooring, a wooden stage, captivating paintings on the walls, and a meticulously restored clock tower."

The structure is single-leveled, but its beauty lies in the intricate details that adorn every part of it. The temple is supported by numerous finely carved pillars, each featuring beautiful architectural engravings that reflect traditional craftsmanship. Constructed entirely with white marble, the temple walls, pillars, and boundary are adorned with delicate carvings of various gods and goddesses, especially from the Malwa region’s artistic style.\n\nAt the heart of the temple resides the deity of Maa Annapurna. The inner sanctum offers a peaceful and calming environment, making it an ideal place for meditation or quiet reflection. The marble flooring adds to the soothing vibe, encouraging visitors to sit and absorb the divine energy of the space.\n\nFrom the outside, the temple is equally captivating. Especially during the evening, it is beautifully illuminated with white and blue lighting that gives the entire structure a divine and ethereal glow. The temple is not just visually impressive, but also thoughtfully designed for visitor comfort. A dedicated footwear stand is available to the left of the entrance for safekeeping.\n\nWithin the same temple complex, there are several smaller shrines, including one dedicated to Lord Shiva. I also noticed a covered well, suggesting that the temple has historical roots and has likely undergone renovations over time. Interestingly, the temple is usually not very crowded, which allows visitors to fully appreciate its spiritual and architectural charm in a calm and peaceful setting."

The temple is dedicated to the worship of Lord Krishna and Radha and is part of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) movement.\n\nLocated in the Nipania area, the temple is easily accessible from different parts of the city and is known for its peaceful atmosphere and devotional activities. The temple regularly hosts spiritual programs, kirtans, bhajans, discourses, and community services such as Anna-Dan Seva (free meal distribution). Major festivals like Janmashtami, Ratha Yatra, and Ekadashi are celebrated with great enthusiasm, drawing large numbers of devotees.\n\nThe images depict the temple’s deities adorned with elaborate blue attire and surrounded by a vibrant decoration of mangoes and mango leaves. This unique mango-themed decoration is a special offering, likely marking a seasonal celebration or festival, which is a hallmark of ISKCON’s festive traditions. The altar is beautifully decorated with fresh mangoes, garlands, and greenery, creating a visually stunning and spiritually uplifting environment.\n\nISKCON Nipania is praised for its well-maintained premises, positive spiritual ambiance, and welcoming environment for families and individuals seeking devotion and tranquility. The temple is open daily, with specific timings for darshan, and offers facilities for purchasing devotional items and prasadam.

And then there is ISKON!**\n\nOne look at the idol and you are completely mesmerized: you will feel as if Krishna is talking to you! Simply outstanding! We were so happy to attend the Aarti and felt truly blessed.\n\nHowever, finding an auto or cab can be challenging since the temple is located in the middle of town-like surroundings. Commute can be particularly difficult on the way back. Additionally, there was no one guiding or notifying about essential facilities like toilets, wash basins, and eating places.\n\nBarring these hiccups, it is a very beautiful temple. I would give it a 4.7 out of 5.\n\n**Hare Krishna!**"

We went with family in Friday and there could be around 500 people at the time but having more people visiting should not be excuse to maintain basic hygiene, the staff and management need to be more proactive to maintain the water park not just from outside but from inside as well. Hope it will improve. - thanks."

              "reviewText": "🌊 Crescent Water Park, Indore – A Fun Getaway for All Ages!\n\nI recently visited Crescent Water Park in Indore, and it was a refreshing and fun-filled experience! The park offers a good mix of water slides, wave pools, lazy rivers, and kid-friendly splash zones, making it ideal for families, groups of friends, and even solo visitors looking to beat the heat.\n\n✅ What I liked:\n\nThe slides are exciting, with options for both thrill-seekers and those who prefer gentler rides.\n\nThe wave pool was a highlight — clean, spacious, and well-maintained.\n\nLifeguards are present at key points, adding a sense of safety.\n\nThere’s ample seating and shaded areas to relax between rides.\n\nAffordable entry fee and locker facilities available at reasonable rates.\n\n📝 What could be better:\n\nChanging rooms and washrooms could be cleaner and better maintained.\n\nFood options inside the park are limited; quality is decent but can be improved.\n\nThe crowd management on weekends could be more organized.\n\n🎟 Tip: Visit on a weekday if you want to avoid the rush and enjoy shorter queues at the rides.\n\n💦 Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)\nSummary: Crescent Water Park is a fun destination in Indore for a refreshing day out, especially during the summer. With a little improvement in cleanliness and food services, it can easily become one of the top water parks in the region."

Originally built in the 7th century from rocks, its architecture intricately depicts Hindu mythological tales, blending ancient craftsmanship with traditional Indian temple design.\nThe temple's main deity is Lord Shiva, represented by a 12-foot Shiva Lingam, notably with the original submerged 12 feet underwater in a sunken shrine, and the present temple built above it. A unique feature is the \"Gomukh\" (cow's mouth) shaped water outlet through which water falls directly onto the Shiva Lingam. Known locally as Garuda Tirth, the temple holds immense faith for devotees. The serene atmosphere, filled with temple bells, hymns, and incense, draws both spiritual seekers and history enthusiasts. A grand fair is held annually on Mahashivratri, attracting numerous devotees."

This temple earns its name due to the size of Lord Ganesha's idol - at the height of about 25 feet from crown to foot, it is said to be one of the largest idols of the God in the world. The statue is made of a peculiar mixture of limestone, jaggery, bricks and sacred soil and water from the major pilgrim places in the country. Located at the end of a quiet lane in the city of Indore, the Bada Ganpati may be a modest-looking temple, but it holds significance simply based on the enormity of the Lord's statue.\n\nThere are conflicting accounts of how the sacred abode came into existence. Established in the year 1875 by Shri Dadich, the construction of Bada Ganpati Temple was brought about by the family members Holkar Dynasty, the rulers of the region then. The Queen Ahilya Bai Holkar undertook the project under her wing more than 100 years ago. Ganpati is said to be the bringer of happiness and prosperity. The Lord is worshipped at the beginning of any new event, venture, or pooja in the entire nation. Devotees from all over the world come to Indore to visit this statue which has a high religious significance.\n\nDevotees of Ganpati should definitely have this temple on their itinerary. It is especially ideal during the festive season when there is a constant celebration through poojas and sweet offerings to the Lord Ganesha in the hope of seeking blessings for peace, prosperity, and well-being.\nThe darshan timing for Bada Ganesh temple is 7:00 AM To 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, on Tuesday from 5:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM to 8:30 PM."

As someone who values precision and thoroughness, I paid close attention to the park’s layout, maintenance, and overall experience.\n\nHighlights:\nThe water slides provided a good variety of thrills, with some offering unexpected twists that added to the fun.\n\nThe wave pool was enjoyable, though slightly crowded at peak hours.\n\nThe affordability was a strong point—the entry fee felt reasonable for the activities offered.\n\nAreas for Improvement:\nHygiene: While the pools were functional, better upkeep and cleanliness would enhance the experience.\n\nStaff Coordination: Some staff members appeared indifferent to visitor concerns, which impacted the overall service quality.\n\nInfrastructure Maintenance: A few attractions showed signs of wear, making some rides feel slightly outdated.\n\nOverall, Mayank Blue Water Park offers a decent escape from Indore’s heat, but improvements in hygiene, maintenance, and staff responsiveness would elevate the experience. It’s a good option for casual fun, though those seeking top-tier water park experiences might find it lacking in refinement."

They only misguide and Mis behave with you specially Ms.Anusuya ( she Isn't even worth being called a doctor), NOt even basic manner of how they're supposed to treat their patients, Specially if they have such doctors like Anusuya, I think the doctors of this hospital need to sit with 1st- 2nd standard children to learn some basic manners & then they should think about looking for another job bcz ophthalmology(eye doctor) is surely not their cup of Tea. These doctors told me to wear ye glasses  (spectacles) , but when I went to other eye hospitals they clearly told me it's not needed at all!\nThank God I changed my eye doctor & went to another hospital"

Company will shut down on 31st 2020 March and this may be the last edit for this review. The time was really good with the company. I can see a clear sadness on my colleagues face, but I'm planning to leave Indore and join a new BPO in a new city (maybe Pune/Mumbai/Bangalore).

The team was very professional, and the new battery works perfectly—just like a brand-new phone.\n\nLater, I also got my cracked screen replaced, and they did an excellent job. The screen looks crystal clear, touch works smoothly, and everything was done within a very short time.\n\nWhat impressed me most was their honesty, quick service, and affordable pricing. They also have a good range of accessories, which makes it a one-stop shop for all mobile needs.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for reliable mobile repairing, battery replacement, or screen replacement services. 👍"
