The structure is single-leveled, but its beauty lies in the intricate details that adorn every part of it. The temple is supported by numerous finely carved pillars, each featuring beautiful architectural engravings that reflect traditional craftsmanship. Constructed entirely with white marble, the temple walls, pillars, and boundary are adorned with delicate carvings of various gods and goddesses, especially from the Malwa region's artistic style.\n\nAt the heart of the temple resides the deity of Maa Annapurna. The inner sanctum offers a peaceful and calming environment, making it an ideal place for meditation or quiet reflection. The marble flooring adds to the soothing vibe, encouraging visitors to sit and absorb the divine energy of the space.\n\nFrom the outside, the temple is equally captivating. Especially during the evening, it is beautifully illuminated with white and blue lighting that gives the entire structure a divine and ethereal glow. The temple is not just visually impressive, but also thoughtfully designed for visitor comfort. A dedicated footwear stand is available to the left of the entrance for safekeeping.\n\nWithin the same temple complex, there are several smaller shrines, including one dedicated to Lord Shiva. I also noticed a covered well, suggesting that the temple has historical roots and has likely undergone renovations over time. Interestingly, the temple is usually not very crowded, which allows visitors to fully appreciate its spiritual and architectural charm in a calm and peaceful setting.",

This temple earns its name due to the size of Lord Ganesha's idol - at the height of about 25 feet from crown to foot, it is said to be one of the largest idols of the God in the world. The statue is made of a peculiar mixture of limestone, jaggery, bricks and sacred soil and water from the major pilgrim places in the country. Located at the end of a quiet lane in the city of Indore, the Bada Ganpati may be a modest-looking temple, but it holds significance simply based on the enormity of the Lord's statue.\n\nThere are conflicting accounts of how the sacred abode came into existence. Established in the year 1875 by Shri Dadich, the construction of Bada Ganpati Temple was brought about by the family members Holkar Dynasty, the rulers of the region then. The Queen Ahilya Bai Holkar undertook the project under her wing more than 100 years ago. Ganpati is said to be the bringer of happiness and prosperity. The Lord is worshipped at the beginning of any new event, venture, or pooja in the entire nation. Devotees from all over the world come to Indore to visit this statue which has a high religious significance.\n\nDevotees of Ganpati should definitely have this temple on their itinerary. It is especially ideal during the festive season when there is a constant celebration through poojas and sweet offerings to the Lord Ganesha in the hope of seeking blessings for peace, prosperity, and well-being.\nThe darshan timing for Bada Ganesh temple is 7:00 AM To 10:00 AM and 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM, on Tuesday from 5:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM to 8:30 PM.",

It's also located in a busy market zone, so reaching it might feel chaotic.
