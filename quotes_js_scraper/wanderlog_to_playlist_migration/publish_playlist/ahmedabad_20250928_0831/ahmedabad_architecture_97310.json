Felt so happy we could visit this place and admire the beauty of it.\n\nStepwells are basically wells for washing, drinking and bathing purely for the ladies and it is very common in Gujarat and rajasthan area. The earliest step wells date back to 2nd century AD.\n\nOver time, these step wells became an architectural marvel and wonderful place to show case their talent, their intricate carvings, their stunning symmetry. It is a wonderful place not only  for history lovers but for photographers too.\n\nThe Rudabhai step well is a five storied step well, built in 1498 by the then king Rana veer singh but completed in record time by Mohammed Begda the muslim ruler who killed Rana veer singh in battle.\n\nLegend says, the queen Rudabhai tricked mohammed begda to finish the step well in record time on the condition that she will marry him, but when the step well was completed, she went back on her promise and killed her self in this step well.\n\nYou can also see some tombs on the step well and the legend goes that the mohammed begda killed the people who constructed such a fantastic step well in record time.\n\nDefinitely a must visit place if you are visiting Gujarat and in particular Ahmedabad. The place is more beautiful when you see it with your own eyes than in the photographs that you see on the net.",

We did go and pray and also enjoyed the way the temple was constructed so beautifully. The entrance to the temple was simply superb construction wise.\n\nThey say it was built in the 18th century, and the temple faces west.\n\nWe went in the early morning hence the sun was directly the mob camera making the photos totally dark.

This circular hill is built of yellow sandstone and features intricate carvings and sculptures of various gods and goddesses.\n\nLayout:\nPilgrims journey through a man-made cave to reach the main shrine at the top of the hill, replicating the experience of visiting the original temple.\n\nSignificance:\nIt's a popular destination, particularly during the Navratri festival, attracting large numbers of devotees who seek the blessings of Goddess Vaishnodevi.\n\nAccessibility:\nThe temple is situated approximately 19 km from Ahmedabad Junction and is well-connected by road, rail, and air.

Located just a short drive from Ahmedabad, this place is a true testament to India's rich heritage and architectural brilliance. If you have even the slightest interest in history, architecture, or photography, this is a must-visit destination.\n\nAs soon as we arrived, we were struck by the calm ambiance and the ancient charm that surrounds the area. Despite being centuries old, the stepwell is remarkably well-preserved. The detailed carvings on the stone walls, pillars, and ceilings are truly mesmerizing. From floral motifs to mythological scenes and intricate patterns, every inch of the structure tells a story. It's hard to believe such craftsmanship was done by hand so many centuries ago. You can actually spend hours admiring the work and still feel like there's more to discover.\n\nBuilt in 1499 by Queen Rudabai, the stepwell is not just an architectural wonder but also holds significant cultural and spiritual importance. It was originally built to provide water to the arid region and served as a resting place for travelers. What makes Adalaj Stepwell unique is its five-story depth, and the blend of Hindu and Jain architectural styles, which makes it a rare and visually stunning heritage site.\n\nOne of the things that stood out during our visit was how cool it felt inside the well, even when the outside temperature was high. It's no wonder locals used this place as a retreat during hot summers. The stepwell was designed to maintain a lower temperature inside, and it works even today.",

The complex houses beautiful tombs of kings and queens, showcasing amazing historical significance. I was particularly impressed by the grand and picturesque lake that enhances the serene atmosphere of this ancient site.\n\nThe architecture is fascinating with its unique stylistic elements. The open courtyard provides a wonderful space to appreciate the intricate details of the structure and offers great photo opportunities. The exquisite lattice work and carved pillars throughout the complex are truly mesmerizing, especially when sunlight filters through.\n\nImportant note: You must remove your footwear before entering the complex, which can be uncomfortable as the ground gets very hot and dirty. I strongly recommend wearing socks as mentioned in the guidelines. Also, avoid visiting during rainy days as the experience will be compromised, and extremely hot days can make the visit unbearable since you'll be walking barefoot on hot surfaces.\n\nDespite these minor inconveniences, Sarkhej Roza is definitely worth visiting for its historical significance and architectural beauty if you plan your visit during comfortable weather conditions.",

Its cave-like form was mesmerizing, not just for its concept but also for its unconventional construction techniques, particularly the use of ferrocement.\n\nColleagues who had worked at B.V. Doshi's office shared fascinating insights-Doshi, the visionary Pritzker Prize-winning architect, would often sketch directly on-site, and the team would build from those sketches. The steps leading to the Gufa's entrance, they say, were first marked directly on the ground, constructed, and only then documented into drawings.\n\nThe shimmering china mosaic domes were a source of fascination for students. It was commonly referred to as the \"Doshi-Hussain Gufa,\" though originally named \"Hussain-Doshi Gufa\" before it was dedicated to the people of Ahmedabad and rechristened \"Amdavad ni Gufa.\"\n\nAt the back, a door and pathway evoke images of Indus Valley Civilization structures unearthed at Lothal and Mohenjodaro, with a ramp descending into the earth. The intricate designs on the door grills add to its enigmatic charm.\n\nA building with no defined purpose-simply a place to sit, read, and reflect. M.F. Hussain had painted spontaneous, sketch-like figures on the interior domes, though nothing substantial. Some of his cutout drawings remain, adding to the ambiance. Children are particularly enthralled by the mysterious structure. For years, they were allowed to play atop the domes, but recently, this has been restricted to preserve the aging china mosaic.\n\nA marvel of architecture, the Gufa stands strong-though perhaps in the near future, it may require thoughtful restoration to preserve its legacy.",

Punyavijayji donated his personal collection of illustrated and un-illustrated manuscripts, bronzes and cloth paintings at time at the establishment of Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Indological Institute. With the passage of time the collection grew more and more prominent which created a need for an exclusive display of the artifacts. Thus, in 1984 a new building adjacent to the L.D. Institute of Indology was built by internationally acclaimed architect Shri. Balakrishna Doshi. The L.D. Museum was formally inaugurated by Shri. Brajkumar Nehru, the then Governor of Gujarat in 1985.\n\nLalbhai Dalpatbhai Museum is open from 10:30 AM in the morning till 5:30 PM in the evening on all days except for Mondays and public holidays. For group visits, the museum has to be informed earlier and can take a guided tour. There is no entry fee to visit Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Museum.\nThis houses a significant collection of Jain art, including sculptures, scrolls, manuscripts, and miniature paintings. Its architecture, designed by renowned architect Balkrishna Doshi, is notable for its integration of modernist and brutalist elements, with a focus on natural light and ventilation.\nThe Lalbhai Dalpatbhai (LD) Museum in Ahmedabad, India, is a case study in museum design and its connection to the preservation and display of cultural heritage\nOverall a very enriching experience.

It's a treat for architecture enthusiasts and photographers.\n•\tHidden Location: The site is well-hidden and not overly crowded, adding to its charm as a peaceful escape amidst the chaos of Manek Chowk.\n\nThings to Note:\n•\tNeglect and Maintenance: Unfortunately, the structures are not well-maintained, and the surrounding area can feel a bit neglected.\n•\tAccessibility: You can't take your car here-it's best to park on the main road and explore the area on foot. Walking through the narrow lanes of the old bazaar is an experience in itself.\n•\tAsk for Directions: Don't rely solely on Google Maps. It's better to ask locals for directions, as the area can be tricky to navigate.\n\nTips:\n•\tCombine your visit with a stroll through the old bazaar and enjoy the food and vibe of Manek Chowk.\n•\tBe prepared for some walking, and take your time exploring this hidden slice of Ahmedabad's history.\n\nIf you're a lover of history and hidden treasures, Rani no Hajiro is worth the visit despite its challenges. It's a glimpse into the city's rich past amidst its thriving present!",

Unfortunately, the experience was underwhelming.\n\nInstead of actively engaging with my project, Mr. Suthar seemed disinterested and suggested I seek services elsewhere. He then proceeded to offer unsolicited advice on validating materials like colors and plywood, which felt inappropriate and condescending.\n\nFurthermore, when I inquired about the estimated cost, he provided a blanket figure of 50L without even reviewing my floor plan.\n\nThis lack of due diligence and the subsequent suggestion that I may not be able to afford his services were highly unprofessional and left me feeling undervalued as a client.\n\nOverall, I am extremely disappointed with the interaction and would not recommend Mr. Suthar's Studio to others seeking interior design services.",

The craftsmanship is impeccable – every detail on the map is precise and beautifully finished. The wooden pieces are lightweight yet sturdy, making it easy to mount on the wall, and the 3D effect adds a striking depth to the decor.\n\nWhat I love most is how versatile it is; it works as both a conversation starter and a minimalist wall art piece. Whether you're a travel enthusiast or just looking for unique home decor, this map is a fantastic choice.\n\nDelivery was quick, and the product was securely packaged to ensure no damage during transit. The included instructions made installation a breeze.\n\nHighly recommend this to anyone looking to add a touch of elegance and personality to their home or office. A perfect blend of functionality and aesthetics!",

Built in 1411 by Sultan Ahmad Shah I, the founder of Ahmedabad, the fort once served as the royal residence of the Gujarat Sultanate.\n\nWe visited the fort during our family trip to Ahmedabad. After walking past the vibrant lanes near Lal Darwaza Market, filled with roadside vendors selling clothes, toys, flowers, and fresh produce, we reached the fort's entrance. It's just a short walk from the iconic Sidi Saiyyed Mosque.\n\nEntry is free, and though the place wasn't crowded inside, security allowed us to walk through the main gate. The fort has eight massive gates, and we could still see the strong outer walls and the old British-era clock tower attached to one of the walls. On the right side of the main path, the Bhadra Kali temple stands - historically preserved since the time of the Sultan. Though the inner door was closed, the temple is said to have a lamp that has been burning continuously for over 600 years.\n\nThere's also a small mosque inside, though its entrance was locked during our visit. The front area of the fort is currently used by some government offices.\n\nOverall, Bhadra Fort offers a great glimpse into Ahmedabad's medieval past. A calm and historical site amidst the chaos of the old city - definitely worth a quick visit if you're exploring the nearby markets or historical spots.",

However, the area outside the fort is bustling with a street shopping market, mainly catering to women. The market is huge but has its downsides.\n\nThe worst part is the pricing-there's no scope for bargaining, and the prices are unreasonably high. Considering the rates, it's better to invest in branded items instead.\n\nParking is another major issue. Cars have no chance here, and even for bikes, managing to find a spot is a struggle.\n\nOverall, it's not worth visiting unless you're specifically interested in exploring the market.",
