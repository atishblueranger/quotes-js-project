We did go and pray and also enjoyed the way the temple was constructed so beautifully. The entrance to the temple was simply superb construction wise.\n\nThey say it was built in the 18th century, and the temple faces west.\n\nWe went in the early morning hence the sun was directly the mob camera making the photos totally dark. So probably the good time to get good photos one must visit in the evening time say after 5 pm."

As soon as you step through its intricately carved entrance, a deep sense of peace envelops you, offering immediate relief from the noise and rush of the outside world.\n\nBuilt in 1848 by a Jain merchant, Sheth Hutheesing, this temple is dedicated to the 15th Jain Tirthankara, Shri Dharmanatha. Crafted primarily from white marble, the temple is a marvel of design, with its delicate carvings, domed ceilings, and latticed windows casting intricate shadows that shift beautifully with the daylight. The sacred chants that gently echo through the sanctum enhance the divine ambience, encouraging reflection and inner calm.\n\nThe temple’s courtyard, adorned with 52 smaller shrines, creates a feeling of being surrounded by layers of devotion. Monks and worshippers move quietly, and the scent of incense lingers in the air, reinforcing a deeply meditative mood. Despite being a popular tourist attraction, the sanctity and serenity of the temple are remarkably preserved.\n\nWhat truly sets Hutheesing Temple apart is the way it combines the spiritual and the aesthetic. The fine craftsmanship is not just art—it’s an expression of faith. Whether you’re religious or simply in search of a tranquil experience, the temple offers a moment of stillness and connection that lingers long after your visit.\n\nIn a world full of distractions, the Hutheesing Jain Temple provides a rare and beautiful pause. It is not just a place of worship, but a space where one can reconnect—with self, silence, and the divine."

It is in the old city of Ahmedabad, and the driver told us, that it would be good to visit this Masjid before 10 am. After that the market opens and there will be heavy traffic.\n\nBuilt by Ahmad shah in 1424 A.D, who is the founder of the city of Ahmedabad. The mosque is very beautiful to look at. As you stand at the small entrance from the road you can see how beautiful is the plan of the mosque.\n\nThere is the prayer hall, and then a large courtyard, which is covered on all 3 sides by corridors. As you go into the prayer hall you can notice the 15 wonderful high raise domes resting on 260 pillars. The buttress on either side of the main arch and as you enter the main arch the pillars are all beautifully carved.\n\nThey have put a green sheet to protect the people who come pray from the sun, but that sheet is definitely spoiling the beauty of the Masjid. They also say that this Masjid had lofty minarets similar to the jama masjid in Delhi but it collapsed in 1819.\n\nwe enjoyed the construction of the mosque and came out since we didn't want to be in the way of the people who were coming in to say their prayers."

Kasturbhai Lalbhai, a wellknown and prominent Ahmedabad based industrialist, and Jain Acharya Muni. Punyavijayji. Muni. Punyavijayji donated his personal collection of illustrated and un-illustrated manuscripts, bronzes and cloth paintings at time at the establishment of Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Indological Institute. With the passage of time the collection grew more and more prominent which created a need for an exclusive display of the artifacts. Thus, in 1984 a new building adjacent to the L.D. Institute of Indology was built by internationally acclaimed architect Shri. Balakrishna Doshi. The L.D. Museum was formally inaugurated by Shri. Brajkumar Nehru, the then Governor of Gujarat in 1985.\n\nLalbhai Dalpatbhai Museum is open from 10:30 AM in the morning till 5:30 PM in the evening on all days except for Mondays and public holidays. For group visits, the museum has to be informed earlier and can take a guided tour. There is no entry fee to visit Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Museum.\nThis houses a significant collection of Jain art, including sculptures, scrolls, manuscripts, and miniature paintings. Its architecture, designed by renowned architect Balkrishna Doshi, is notable for its integration of modernist and brutalist elements, with a focus on natural light and ventilation.\nThe Lalbhai Dalpatbhai (LD) Museum in Ahmedabad, India, is a case study in museum design and its connection to the preservation and display of cultural heritage\nOverall a very enriching experience.  Must visit."

The complex houses beautiful tombs of kings and queens, showcasing amazing historical significance. I was particularly impressed by the grand and picturesque lake that enhances the serene atmosphere of this ancient site.\n\nThe architecture is fascinating with its unique stylistic elements. The open courtyard provides a wonderful space to appreciate the intricate details of the structure and offers great photo opportunities. The exquisite lattice work and carved pillars throughout the complex are truly mesmerizing, especially when sunlight filters through.\n\nImportant note: You must remove your footwear before entering the complex, which can be uncomfortable as the ground gets very hot and dirty. I strongly recommend wearing socks as mentioned in the guidelines. Also, avoid visiting during rainy days as the experience will be compromised, and extremely hot days can make the visit unbearable since you'll be walking barefoot on hot surfaces.\n\nDespite these minor inconveniences, Sarkhej Roza is definitely worth visiting for its historical significance and architectural beauty if you plan your visit during comfortable weather conditions."

Built in the 15th century, it serves as a mausoleum for the revered Sufi saint, Sheikh Ahmed Khattu Ganj Baksh. The site is a serene retreat, characterized by its elegant domes, intricately carved pillars, and expansive courtyards.\n\nVisiting Sarkhej Roza feels like stepping into a tranquil oasis, away from the city's hustle and bustle. The intricate latticework and exquisite calligraphy reflect the artistry of the period, making it a photographer's delight. The peaceful atmosphere is perfect for contemplation and reflection.\n\nOne of the highlights is the large water tank, which enhances the beauty of the surroundings and offers a serene spot for visitors to relax. The combination of historical significance and architectural splendor makes it an important cultural landmark.\n\nWhile it can be less crowded than other tourist spots, this adds to its charm. Sarkhej Roza is a must-visit for anyone interested in history, architecture, or spirituality. It’s a place that invites you to connect with the past and appreciate the rich heritage of Gujarat."

              "reviewText": "Located just 8 km from Ahmedabad, Sarkhej Roza is a majestic 15th-century architectural complex nestled in the quiet village of Sarkhej. Revered as the \"Acropolis of Ahmedabad\", this site draws parallels to the Parthenon in Athens, not just in scale but in spiritual and architectural grandeur.\n\nCommissioned by Sultan Ahmed Shah for the esteemed Sufi saint Sheikh Ahmed Khattu Ganj Baksh, the complex houses his serene tomb along with royal mausoleums of Sultan Mahmud Begada, his queen Rani Rajabai, their sons, an open Jama Masjid, a historic water tank, and a library-museum preserving ancient coins and manuscripts.\n\nThe experience begins with a short walk from the parking area through arched stone gateways marked with history. Inside, one is greeted by massive sandstone pillars, cool marble flooring, and open courtyards. Despite the festive buzz of Eid, the complex retained a sense of calm and reverence.\n\nWhat stands out are the stone-carved walls, intricately decorated with Arabic-Indo geometric patterns—symmetrical, artistic, and beautifully weathered. Each section holds its charm:\n\nThe royal tombs of Begada and his sons lie under richly carved domes, though sadly, some areas show signs of neglect.\n\nThe tomb of Sheikh Ganj Baksh was active with local devotees in prayer and Quran recitation.\n\nA modest library and museum nearby, though disorganized, showcase old currency, documents, and artifacts.\n\nThe once-grand 17-acre water tank, visible through lattice balconies, now lies dry, used only during the monsoon. It was originally built to support gardens and local needs.\n\nUnfortunately, the complex lacks signage and proper maintenance. Still, the place leaves a strong emotional and historical impression—a powerful reminder of Gujarat's rich spiritual and architectural heritage.\n\nSarkhej Roza is not just a monument—it is a silent, crumbling manuscript of history, faith, and forgotten glory."

              "reviewText": "The Amdavad ni Gufa was built during my final years at CEPT, a time when it captured the imagination of every student. Its cave-like form was mesmerizing, not just for its concept but also for its unconventional construction techniques, particularly the use of ferrocement.\n\nColleagues who had worked at B.V. Doshi’s office shared fascinating insights—Doshi, the visionary Pritzker Prize-winning architect, would often sketch directly on-site, and the team would build from those sketches. The steps leading to the Gufa’s entrance, they say, were first marked directly on the ground, constructed, and only then documented into drawings.\n\nThe shimmering china mosaic domes were a source of fascination for students. It was commonly referred to as the \"Doshi-Hussain Gufa,\" though originally named \"Hussain-Doshi Gufa\" before it was dedicated to the people of Ahmedabad and rechristened \"Amdavad ni Gufa.\"\n\nAt the back, a door and pathway evoke images of Indus Valley Civilization structures unearthed at Lothal and Mohenjodaro, with a ramp descending into the earth. The intricate designs on the door grills add to its enigmatic charm.\n\nA building with no defined purpose—simply a place to sit, read, and reflect. M.F. Hussain had painted spontaneous, sketch-like figures on the interior domes, though nothing substantial. Some of his cutout drawings remain, adding to the ambiance. Children are particularly enthralled by the mysterious structure. For years, they were allowed to play atop the domes, but recently, this has been restricted to preserve the aging china mosaic.\n\nA marvel of architecture, the Gufa stands strong—though perhaps in the near future, it may require thoughtful restoration to preserve its legacy."

The combination of B.V. Doshi's design and M.F. Husain's artwork gives it a lot of cultural value, and it's great for people who are into modern art or unusual spaces.\n\nThe place felt a bit under-maintained, and there wasn't much context or information about the art inside. It's a quick visit - maybe 20-30 minutes - unless you're into taking photos or sketching. Also, the lighting inside can be too dim to properly appreciate the artwork.\n\nThe area around the Gufa is nice though, with a chill café and a creative vibe thanks to nearby students and artists."

It was clearly shown that the university had responded to the challenge of a massive population with such a massive university ground capable of fitting thousands of students. Its infrastructure allowed it to be a resting place many students could study at during both the winter and summer months, and it was quite amazing to see students hard at work. However, I will say the university could use more ramps for those who are challenged in walking up and down stairs, as it may prove hard to enter some of the upper floors without a ramp.\n\nWe were lucky enough that we visited when the architectural students were displaying their work, and we got first-hand experience in seeing what the assessments were like in a foreign country and contrasting it to our own. It was a fantastic experience and a must do if you are also a student."

Felt so happy we could visit this place and admire the beauty of it.\n\nStepwells are basically wells for washing, drinking and bathing purely for the ladies and it is very common in Gujarat and rajasthan area. The earliest step wells date back to 2nd century AD.\n\nOver time, these step wells became an architectural marvel and wonderful place to show case their talent, their intricate carvings, their stunning symmetry. It is a wonderful place not only  for history lovers but for photographers too.\n\nThe Rudabhai step well is a five storied step well, built in 1498 by the then king Rana veer singh but completed in record time by Mohammed Begda the muslim ruler who killed Rana veer singh in battle.\n\nLegend says, the queen Rudabhai tricked mohammed begda to finish the step well in record time on the condition that she will marry him, but when the step well was completed, she went back on her promise and killed her self in this step well.\n\nYou can also see some tombs on the step well and the legend goes that the mohammed begda killed the people who constructed such a fantastic step well in record time.\n\nDefinitely a must visit place if you are visiting Gujarat and in particular Ahmedabad.

You can find beautiful traditional clothes, jewellery, and accessories at very good prices.\nAfter shopping, I went to Manekchowk, which is very famous for street food.

              "reviewText": "“Rani no Hajiro: A Hidden Gem in Ahmedabad”\n\nRani no Hajiro is a beautiful yet underrated historical site tucked away in the bustling Manek Chowk food area. It’s a hidden gem surrounded by local residences and the lively old bazaar, offering a unique blend of history and everyday life.\n\nWhat Makes It Special:\n•\tIntricate Architecture: The beautiful windows with intricate carvings and neglected yet charming structures give it a timeless aura. It’s a treat for architecture enthusiasts and photographers.\n•\tHidden Location: The site is well-hidden and not overly crowded, adding to its charm as a peaceful escape amidst the chaos of Manek Chowk.\n\nThings to Note:\n•\tNeglect and Maintenance: Unfortunately, the structures are not well-maintained, and the surrounding area can feel a bit neglected.\n•\tAccessibility: You can’t take your car here—it’s best to park on the main road and explore the area on foot. Walking through the narrow lanes of the old bazaar is an experience in itself.\n•\tAsk for Directions: Don’t rely solely on Google Maps. It’s better to ask locals for directions, as the area can be tricky to navigate.\n\nTips:\n•\tCombine your visit with a stroll through the old bazaar and enjoy the food and vibe of Manek Chowk.\n•\tBe prepared for some walking, and take your time exploring this hidden slice of Ahmedabad’s history.\n\nIf you’re a lover of history and hidden treasures, Rani no Hajiro is worth the visit despite its challenges. It’s a glimpse into the city’s rich past amidst its thriving present!"

The historical monument itself appears somewhat shabby. However, look beyond the exterior and you'll discover a hidden gem for unique women's accessories.\n\nTreasure Trove of Trinkets\n\nThe area surrounding the tomb is a haven for budget-friendly shopping. Here, you'll find a variety of shops selling everything from stunning handcrafted accessories (starting as low as ₹50!) to beautiful dupattas and chaniya cholis. The selection is truly impressive, and I personally found myself drawn to the unique pieces, ultimately leaving with a collection worth ₹2,000.\n\nEssentials and Refreshment\n\nWhile exploring the shops, you'll also find refreshment stalls offering a quick pick-me-up. Public restrooms are available for a small fee, but be warned – their cleanliness might leave something to be desired.\n\nFood Paradise Nearby\n\nAfter your shopping spree, head to the nearby Manek Chowk, a foodie's paradise, for a delightful and well-deserved meal. Don't forget to put your bargaining skills to the test here as well!\n\nThings to Keep in Mind\n\nWhile Rano no Hajiro offers a unique shopping experience, there are a few things to consider:\n\nCondition of the Monument: The historical structure itself is not well-maintained and may appear neglected.\nBasic Amenities: Public restrooms are available but might not be the cleanest.\nRecommendation:\n\nRani no Hajiro is perfect for those seeking one-of-a-kind accessories at affordable prices. However, if you're expecting a pristine historical site, you might be disappointed.\n\nSo, if you're an adventurous shopper who can overlook the monument's condition, head to Rani no Hajiro and unleash your inner bargain hunter! Just remember to factor in a post-shopping meal at the vibrant Manek Chowk!\n\nTo know more detailed reviews about food, follow me on Instagram - foodwith_rumbumm and for travel rumbum_vlogs"

But unfortunately this place is not preserved properly, it's in very poor condition few people have encroached inside and outside of complex, kids playing cricket inside, people sleeping at entrance,\nHow will tourist come to such places ???\n\nno attention and proper information displayed by ASI despite the site is around 500 years old. It's shocking.\n\nWe need to preserve our history we can't change it. Even if we don't like it.\n\nMust visit for all. If more tourists come may be ASI will pay more attention,\nBest way is to charge 25 Rs as a entry ticket."

The design seamlessly integrates with the surrounding landscape, creating an inviting and inspiring ambiance. The blend of modernist principles, innovative design elements, and a deep understanding of the local context results in a campus that not only nurtures intellectual growth but also serves as a testament to architectural excellence.The dormitories, known as the Louis Kahn Complex, follow a modular design that prioritizes privacy, communal living, and functional simplicity. The exposed brickwork and minimalistic aesthetics create a sense of unity with the campus's overall architectural theme. The IIM Ahmedabad Library, another architectural marvel, features a circular design that allows for an uninterrupted flow of space. The circular reading room provides ample natural light and panoramic views of the surrounding landscape, creating an atmosphere conducive to focused study and research."

              "reviewText": "I recently visited Tagore Hall for official program organized by institute , and overall, it was a positive experience!\n\nArchitecture and Design: The hall, designed by B.V. Doshi, is a striking architectural piece. While the exterior is quite stoic, featuring a brutalist style with concrete and large columns, the interior offers a beautiful contrast. The renovated lobby is neat and aesthetically pleasing, creating a welcoming atmosphere. The spacious auditorium can comfortably accommodate around 700 to 1000 people without any obstructive columns, making it ideal for various events.\n\nFacilities: The seating arrangement is decent, although the chairs could use an update as they felt a bit worn. There’s plenty of parking available for both four-wheelers and two-wheelers, which is a big plus. The garden area is a lovely touch, providing a nice space for children to play.\n\nAmbiance and Experience: The environment was calm, and the acoustics in the hall are impressive. During our visit, we enjoyed exploring the vast space and even played around with the echo from the stage! I can only imagine how vibrant it would be during an actual performance.\n\nAreas for Improvement: While the facilities are generally good, the restrooms could be better maintained, and the absence of ramps for wheelchair accessibility is a concern. It also had a slightly musty feel, likely due to stagnant air, which could be improved with better ventilation.\n\nOverall Impression: Tagore Hall is an excellent venue for large events like dance shows, lectures, and seminars, especially with its proximity to the Sabarmati riverfront. If you appreciate architectural design or are looking for a spacious venue, I highly recommend visiting!"

              "reviewText": "Ahmedabad Textile Mill-Owner's Association Building or ATMA House as it is often called is one of my favourite buildings in Ahmedabad. A shining example of late Modernist Movement in Architecture, it makes Ahmedabad proud as being one of the four buildings designed by the Great Master Le-Corbusier here.\n\nIt is the Mill-Owner's Association's head-quarters, and was completed in 1954. Ahmedabad was very active in Textile trade at that time.\n\nThe building has various elements that form the manifesto of Le-Corbusier's \"Modern Architecture\". The building has a nearly clear structural grid, which creates a 'free plan'; the internal walls taking various shapes.\n\nWhat I liked most is the way the building opens up on the Sabarmati river-side. A quiet futuristic thought by the architect that someday the river would be brimming with water and sunlight  shimmering on its ripples. Much of the light in the building is from this open East side, offering a fantastic view of the river as well.\n\nThe second element I liked most is the front staircase which is like a sculptural piece jutting out of the Cube the building forms. The Red door and the framed doorway on the top at Second Floor Level is the most dramatic. You open this door to a huge free space and an open wall on the other end.\n\nMany fascinating elements and details have been worked out in this building which makes it amazing.\n\n*Right from the entry point, a ramp which sticks out like a long tongue from the building. It's railing which seems to be anthropometrically shaped welcoming the hand of the visitor.\n\n*A wicket window and seat at the top of the ramp, for may be the security guard looks dainty.\n\n*RCC (reinforced cement concrete) technology was new at that time in India. The use of wooden formwork is one more brilliant idea as you can even today, after 65 plus years see the grains of that wood imbibed in the concrete.\n\n*The terrace is like a grand finale to the architectural drama of the building. The shape  scoops up forming the amphitheatre on the terrace. Though not much used, it could form an interesting place for gatherings and debates in the late evening or night. The lift comes right till the terrace in this building.\n\nAll in all ATMA building is a classic example of Le-Corbusier's memorable work, inspiring Architects even today!!!"

They certainly displayed that modernist appeal, and I especially liked the ramp between the angled facade. It is large and suggests power to the textile factory. In the museum, I observed wooden louvred windows as well. I love the common use of it in building structures."

              "reviewText": "Corbusier’s Mill Owner’s building, although now disused and very difficult to enter without the appropriate reasons or documentation is an extremely open brutalist structure. Almost entirely the building is open to the natural elements, which would be due to the high heat range in Ahmedabad and it being 30 degrees every day even during the height of winter.\n\nThe window openings are very reflective of those in the palace of assembly entrance facade and create some stunning light play within the space. Although we were only there for about 10 minutes it was brilliant to soak up the concrete spectacle that has some of the most interesting light patterns I’ve seen in an architectural space."

              "reviewText": "The building sits between Ashram Road to the west and the Sabarmati River to the east. The side walls, to the north and south, are nearly blank and faced in rough stone with a brick exterior. The brises-soleil on the west facade are oriented diagonally to obstruct views from the street while permitting air and indirect sunlight to enter the space. Plants spill from the porous facade, activating the exposed concrete and supplementing the roof garden. At the rear of the building, the brises-soleil are perpendicular to the facade, allowing the breeze from the river to pass uninhibited through the shaded perimeter. Here, Le Corbusier designed the openings to frame views of the river below."

Unfortunately, the experience was underwhelming.\n\nInstead of actively engaging with my project, Mr. Suthar seemed disinterested and suggested I seek services elsewhere. He then proceeded to offer unsolicited advice on validating materials like colors and plywood, which felt inappropriate and condescending.\n\nFurthermore, when I inquired about the estimated cost, he provided a blanket figure of 50L without even reviewing my floor plan.\n\nThis lack of due diligence and the subsequent suggestion that I may not be able to afford his services were highly unprofessional and left me feeling undervalued as a client.\n\nOverall, I am extremely disappointed with the interaction and would not recommend Mr. Suthar's Studio to others seeking interior design services."

Ladies are not allowed inside the mosque.\n\nMosque is quiet small and compact, but highlights the beauty of the indo islamic architecture.\n\nBuilt in the year 1572-73 by an Abyssinian (person from Ethiopia) called Sidi Saiyyed, who served under the then sultan. This mosque is well known for the wonderful intricate carvings in stone and their unique semi circular tracery windows, depicting the tree of life.\n\nPaper cutouts were made of the carved screens from which two wooden replicas were made and these are now in museum in London and New york.\n\nThe driver was telling us that this mosque is still in use as the emblem of the Ahmedabad municipality.\n\nThe grave of sidi saiyyed is inside this mosque.\n\nThe mosque is in a congested area, hence parking is out of the question. Definitely worth a visit to admire the wonderful jalli work in the windows."

Built in the 15th century, it served as a crucial water reservoir during a time of drought and showcases remarkable engineering.\n\nHighlights for Visitors:\n\nArchitecture: The stepwell features intricate carvings, pillars, and arches, highlighting the craftsmanship of the period. The detailed stonework and geometric patterns are particularly impressive.\n\nHistorical Significance: It reflects the engineering ingenuity of the time and is a testament to the importance of water conservation in arid regions.\n\nPhotography: The unique structure, especially when illuminated by sunlight filtering through the arches, provides excellent photography opportunities. Photography not permitted inside the mosque.\n\nAtmosphere: Bai Harir Vav offers an environment, ideal for exploration on non crowded days.\n\nTips for Visiting:\n\nBest Time to Visit: Early morning or late afternoon is ideal for pleasant weather and better lighting for photos.\n\nAccess: Be prepared for many stairs, unsafe ledges and uneven surfaces, as it's a stepwell with multiple levels. Many restrictions in the mosque area.\n\nRespect the Space: As a historical site, visitors should maintain decorum and respect the site's integrity.\n\nEntry is free although a person inside asks for \"tips\" apparently.\nBeautiful architecture. Much of the stone work is still fully intact. The mosque alongside alos has amazing stone carving.\nIts a bit away from main sites and the location isn't the best, but definitely worth visiting. One of the few places to figure Sanskrit with Persian and Islamic motifs with images of hindu gods and bells. Free to visit.\nLovely place in the bustling city of Ahmedabad! It's a place not known by many. And probably that's good because there is little crowd there. But wait, it is crowded by lot of llangurs. Probably the most I have seen at any place.

              "reviewText": "Yesterday, I visited a beautiful temple, and I have to say—the location and the view felt truly royal. If you're thinking about going, the best part is that it's not crowded or chaotic. It's peaceful, and you can easily plan it as a one-day trip. You’ll be able to return the same day without any hassle.\nHere’s how I did it: I booked an Uber for the whole day. When you book, just select the \"intercity\" or \"outstation\" option and choose your pickup time, date, and return time (that part is required). Then, pick the type of cab you want—whether it's \"intercity\" or \"suden\" (the main difference is just the size of the vehicle). The driver will pick you up right from your location.\nOne very important thing to keep in mind: the temple is located near the Gujarat–Rajasthan border, in a place called Ratanpur. Now here’s the tricky part—when booking your cab, make sure to select Ratanpur, Gujarat. Even though it’s the same place, if you select Ratanpur, Rajasthan, the price might be higher because crossing state borders can increase the fare. Choosing Ratanpur in Gujarat keeps the cost lower.Also, if you want to explore nearby spots, Uber lets you add extra stops. After visiting Ratanpur, I added another destination: Dungarpur, which is just 30 km away. It’s a lovely town with a peaceful lake and the beautiful Uday Vilas Palace ,Samba ji (lord krishna)—definitely worth a visit if you have time.\n\nHope this helps you plan your trip smoothly!"

Highway which got proximity to ring road, Gandhinagar and the connectivity to Ahmedabad City area.\n\nOne concerning point is that the in-campus hostels get full early on, and the parents will have to opt for the PG & privaye hostels outside which are quite expensive."

Hence there is no enty for outsiders to the top of the  tower. Out of the 2.towers, 1 tower is destroyed by the British while their engineers checked to find out the mystery of the shaking towers.

              "reviewText": "Bhadra Fort is a historic gem located in the heart of old Ahmedabad, right next to the bustling Teen Darwaza Market. Built in 1411 by Sultan Ahmad Shah I, the founder of Ahmedabad, the fort once served as the royal residence of the Gujarat Sultanate.\n\nWe visited the fort during our family trip to Ahmedabad. After walking past the vibrant lanes near Lal Darwaza Market, filled with roadside vendors selling clothes, toys, flowers, and fresh produce, we reached the fort's entrance. It’s just a short walk from the iconic Sidi Saiyyed Mosque.\n\nEntry is free, and though the place wasn’t crowded inside, security allowed us to walk through the main gate. The fort has eight massive gates, and we could still see the strong outer walls and the old British-era clock tower attached to one of the walls. On the right side of the main path, the Bhadra Kali temple stands — historically preserved since the time of the Sultan. Though the inner door was closed, the temple is said to have a lamp that has been burning continuously for over 600 years.\n\nThere’s also a small mosque inside, though its entrance was locked during our visit. The front area of the fort is currently used by some government offices.\n\nOverall, Bhadra Fort offers a great glimpse into Ahmedabad’s medieval past. A calm and historical site amidst the chaos of the old city — definitely worth a quick visit if you're exploring the nearby markets or historical spots."

The fort itself is just a massive entrance with nothing much to explore inside. However, the area outside the fort is bustling with a street shopping market, mainly catering to women. The market is huge but has its downsides.\n\nThe worst part is the pricing—there's no scope for bargaining, and the prices are unreasonably high. Considering the rates, it's better to invest in branded items instead.\n\nParking is another major issue. Cars have no chance here, and even for bikes, managing to find a spot is a struggle.\n\nOverall, it's not worth visiting unless you're specifically interested in exploring the market."

Located just a short drive from Ahmedabad, this place is a true testament to India’s rich heritage and architectural brilliance. If you have even the slightest interest in history, architecture, or photography, this is a must-visit destination.\n\nAs soon as we arrived, we were struck by the calm ambiance and the ancient charm that surrounds the area. Despite being centuries old, the stepwell is remarkably well-preserved. The detailed carvings on the stone walls, pillars, and ceilings are truly mesmerizing. From floral motifs to mythological scenes and intricate patterns, every inch of the structure tells a story. It's hard to believe such craftsmanship was done by hand so many centuries ago. You can actually spend hours admiring the work and still feel like there’s more to discover.\n\nBuilt in 1499 by Queen Rudabai, the stepwell is not just an architectural wonder but also holds significant cultural and spiritual importance. It was originally built to provide water to the arid region and served as a resting place for travelers. What makes Adalaj Stepwell unique is its five-story depth, and the blend of Hindu and Jain architectural styles, which makes it a rare and visually stunning heritage site.\n\nOne of the things that stood out during our visit was how cool it felt inside the well, even when the outside temperature was high. It’s no wonder locals used this place as a retreat during hot summers. The stepwell was designed to maintain a lower temperature inside, and it works even today."

              "reviewText": "Adalaj ni Vav, also known as Rudabai Stepwell, is one of the most beautiful and historically significant stepwells in India. Located in Adalaj village, about 18 km from Ahmedabad, this architectural wonder was built in 1499 by Queen Rudabai, in memory of her husband Rana Veer Singh of the Vaghela dynasty.\n\nThe story behind the stepwell is touching—after her husband was killed in battle, the construction was completed by Sultan Mahmud Begada. Legend says he agreed to finish the stepwell after proposing to Queen Rudabai, but once completed, the queen chose to sacrifice herself rather than marry him.\n\nThe stepwell is five stories deep and features a unique blend of Hindu, Jain, and Islamic architectural styles. The carvings, pillars, and overall layout are simply mesmerizing. It’s also designed to keep the temperature inside cooler than outside—a brilliant example of ancient engineering.\n\nThe site is well-maintained, entry is free, and it's easily accessible by road from both Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar. Ideal to visit in the morning or evening to avoid the heat and enjoy great photos. A peaceful spot with a deep sense of history—highly recommended for history lovers and architecture enthusiasts!"

It’s a great spot to spend some quiet time and explore beautiful architecture and heritage.\n\nHowever, the area around the stepwell isn’t very developed — there aren’t many good food or outing options nearby, so it’s better to plan accordingly. That said, the stepwell is definitely worth visiting at least once for anyone who enjoys historical sites and serene spots."

It’s perfect for photography and exploring the craftsmanship of the past. However, despite its beauty and historical significance, the location feels surprisingly nondescript. While there are signboards, they are inadequate, and the absence of guides means visitors miss out on learning the rich stories behind this monument.\n\nHarir Bir Vav is a fine blend of Hindu and Islamic architectural styles, reflecting the rich cultural heritage of the Gujarat Sultanate. The stepwell features intricate geometric patterns, floral motifs, and carved pillars that showcase the unparalleled craftsmanship of the 15th century. Its multi-level structure includes descending flights of steps, open spaces, and shaded corridors\n\nThe symmetry and artistry of the carvings make it a photographer’s delight and an essential stop for anyone interested in history or architecture.\n\nThe site is similar in construction to the Adalaj Stepwell, another iconic site in Gujarat, but has its own unique charm and serene atmosphere due to the lack of crowds.\n\nThe presence of water at the bottom adds to the ambiance, but unfortunately, it is unclean. Cleaning the water would be a great way to show respect to the artisans who created this masterpiece.\n\nBuilt in 1499 AD by Bai Harir, a noblewoman and superintendent of Sultan Mahmud Begada's royal harem, this stepwell is a fine example of Indo-Islamic architecture.\n\nThe site is accessible via good roads, making it easy to include as part of a city tour in Ahmedabad. If you are in Ahmedabad, don’t miss the chance to visit this hidden gem and appreciate the artistry of the 15th century."

The craftsmanship is impeccable – every detail on the map is precise and beautifully finished. The wooden pieces are lightweight yet sturdy, making it easy to mount on the wall, and the 3D effect adds a striking depth to the decor.\n\nWhat I love most is how versatile it is; it works as both a conversation starter and a minimalist wall art piece. Whether you're a travel enthusiast or just looking for unique home decor, this map is a fantastic choice.\n\nDelivery was quick, and the product was securely packaged to ensure no damage during transit. The included instructions made installation a breeze.\n\nHighly recommend this to anyone looking to add a touch of elegance and personality to their home or office. A perfect blend of functionality and aesthetics!"

Living in Abu Dhabi, UAE, I was initially concerned about the delivery process and whether the product would arrive safely. However, to my pleasant surprise, the product was delivered within just 3 days of placing the order, and it arrived in a well-organized package.\n\nThe timely delivery of the product was particularly important to me, as I had planned to install the map on a special occasion. It just so happened that the delivery fell on the birthday of my wife and the death anniversary of my beloved father. This coincidence allowed us to begin the installation process around midnight, and we continued working on it until the early morning hours of my father's death anniversary. It was a poignant and meaningful experience, made possible by the timely arrival of the product.\n\nIn addition to the impeccable timing of the delivery, the quality of the product exceeded my expectations. Not only was the finishing perfect, but the colors of the maps were incredibly vibrant, adding a beautiful touch to our home decor. Additionally, the user manual provided was well-prepared and easy to follow, allowing us to install the map ourselves within just 2-3 hours.\n\nIn conclusion, my experience with The Map Store was nothing short of exceptional. From the seamless ordering process to the swift delivery and outstanding product quality, every aspect of my interaction with The Map Store was marked by professionalism and excellence. I wholeheartedly recommend The Map Store to anyone seeking high-quality maps and exceptional service."

The complex houses beautiful tombs of kings and queens, showcasing amazing historical significance. I was particularly impressed by the grand and picturesque lake that enhances the serene atmosphere of this ancient site.\n\nThe architecture is fascinating with its unique stylistic elements. The open courtyard provides a wonderful space to appreciate the intricate details of the structure and offers great photo opportunities. The exquisite lattice work and carved pillars throughout the complex are truly mesmerizing, especially when sunlight filters through.\n\nImportant note: You must remove your footwear before entering the complex, which can be uncomfortable as the ground gets very hot and dirty. I strongly recommend wearing socks as mentioned in the guidelines. Also, avoid visiting during rainy days as the experience will be compromised, and extremely hot days can make the visit unbearable since you'll be walking barefoot on hot surfaces.\n\nDespite these minor inconveniences, Sarkhej Roza is definitely worth visiting for its historical significance and architectural beauty if you plan your visit during comfortable weather conditions."

The intricate latticework and exquisite calligraphy reflect the artistry of the period, making it a photographer's delight. The peaceful atmosphere is perfect for contemplation and reflection.\n\nOne of the highlights is the large water tank, which enhances the beauty of the surroundings and offers a serene spot for visitors to relax. The combination of historical significance and architectural splendor makes it an important cultural landmark.\n\nWhile it can be less crowded than other tourist spots, this adds to its charm.

Revered as the \"Acropolis of Ahmedabad\", this site draws parallels to the Parthenon in Athens, not just in scale but in spiritual and architectural grandeur.\n\nCommissioned by Sultan Ahmed Shah for the esteemed Sufi saint Sheikh Ahmed Khattu Ganj Baksh, the complex houses his serene tomb along with royal mausoleums of Sultan Mahmud Begada, his queen Rani Rajabai, their sons, an open Jama Masjid, a historic water tank, and a library-museum preserving ancient coins and manuscripts.\n\nThe experience begins with a short walk from the parking area through arched stone gateways marked with history. Inside, one is greeted by massive sandstone pillars, cool marble flooring, and open courtyards. Despite the festive buzz of Eid, the complex retained a sense of calm and reverence.\n\nWhat stands out are the stone-carved walls, intricately decorated with Arabic-Indo geometric patterns—symmetrical, artistic, and beautifully weathered. Each section holds its charm:\n\nThe royal tombs of Begada and his sons lie under richly carved domes, though sadly, some areas show signs of neglect.\n\nThe tomb of Sheikh Ganj Baksh was active with local devotees in prayer and Quran recitation.\n\nA modest library and museum nearby, though disorganized, showcase old currency, documents, and artifacts.\n\nThe once-grand 17-acre water tank, visible through lattice balconies, now lies dry, used only during the monsoon. It was originally built to support gardens and local needs.\n\nUnfortunately, the complex lacks signage and proper maintenance. Still, the place leaves a strong emotional and historical impression—a powerful reminder of Gujarat's rich spiritual and architectural heritage.\n\nSarkhej Roza is not just a monument—it is a silent, crumbling manuscript of history, faith, and forgotten glory."

Felt so happy we could visit this place and admire the beauty of it.\n\nStepwells are basically wells for washing, drinking and bathing purely for the ladies and it is very common in Gujarat and rajasthan area. The earliest step wells date back to 2nd century AD.\n\nOver time, these step wells became an architectural marvel and wonderful place to show case their talent, their intricate carvings, their stunning symmetry. It is a wonderful place not only  for history lovers but for photographers too.\n\nThe Rudabhai step well is a five storied step well, built in 1498 by the then king Rana veer singh but completed in record time by Mohammed Begda the muslim ruler who killed Rana veer singh in battle.\n\nLegend says, the queen Rudabhai tricked mohammed begda to finish the step well in record time on the condition that she will marry him, but when the step well was completed, she went back on her promise and killed her self in this step well.\n\nYou can also see some tombs on the step well and the legend goes that the mohammed begda killed the people who constructed such a fantastic step well in record time.\n\nDefinitely a must visit place if you are visiting Gujarat and in particular Ahmedabad. The place is more beautiful when you see it with your own eyes than in the photographs that you see on the net."

This mosque is well known for the wonderful intricate carvings in stone and their unique semi circular tracery windows, depicting the tree of life.\n\nPaper cutouts were made of the carved screens from which two wooden replicas were made and these are now in museum in London and New york.\n\nThe driver was telling us that this mosque is still in use as the emblem of the Ahmedabad municipality.\n\nThe grave of sidi saiyyed is inside this mosque.\n\nThe mosque is in a congested area, hence parking is out of the question.

The textile heritage of the country has been preserved here unlike elsewhere in India. Despite being very old, the space was very neat and clean, odour free, lush green and peaceful. Even though it was a 2 hour guided tour, it was absolutely free of cost and at the end of the tour we were also offered a very tasty tea with boiled groundnuts which was a refreshing experience after 2 hour long tour. The lady guide was extremely passionate about the subject. The textile collection is diverse and representative of various states.\n\nNow, coming to improvements, the owners limit the number of visitors which seems to be in contradiction with the vision of owners to let the world at large know of the rich indian heritage. In the age of technology, manual guide seems like too monotonous and repetitive and less interesting. There are 3 different tours and you can't do all in one day. A visitor to a state doesn't like to come to the same place every day. It's a private museum and you need to book in advance and share lot of personal data and information which looks risky from the point of view of privacy in today's day and time. Not being able to take camera along is another dampener as you don't have any memories to take along for long time. While the tour is structured, every person has its own way of experiencing places like museums - so the timing may not be to everyone's liking"

If you have telescope then it's best, we had both and spotted many birds here including kingfisher.

For those seeking tranquility, an early morning visit at 6 AM or 6:30 AM is recommended to witness a breathtaking sunrise and the enchanting presence of majestic birds. A canteen on-site provides basic refreshments. Beware of mischievous monkeys roaming the area. Weekends, however, come with a downside as parking fees surge to ₹500, compared to the regular ₹400 on weekdays. Despite the maintenance issues and fluctuating prices, Thol's natural beauty and avian wonders make it worth considering for nature enthusiasts and early risers."

Nestled quietly along the banks of the serene Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad, this ashram—once home to Mahatma Gandhi from 1917 to 1930—is a living testimony to India's freedom struggle.\n\nThough Ahmedabad has grown into a bustling city, the path to the ashram still holds a certain calm. Passing through well-developed riverfront roads adorned with parks and gardens, we reached the 'Magan Gandhi Gate'—a quieter entrance. Despite being a weekend, the ashram remained calm and uncrowded, amplifying its aura of peace and simplicity.\n\nInside, the shady trees, humble buildings, and displays of Gandhi’s life and tools, especially inside Magan Nivas and Hriday Kunj, evoke deep reflection. Each corner, from prayer grounds to Gandhi’s study and sleeping quarters, feels sacred and grounded in history. Handwritten notes, rare photographs, and even traditional spinning wheels offer a quiet glimpse into the soul of the Mahatma.\n\nThe peaceful ambiance, chirping birds, and even the sight of graceful peacocks wandering in the lawns add to the spiritual feel of the place. It was deeply moving to walk through the places where Bapu meditated, wrote letters, spun khadi, and led a movement that changed the destiny of a nation.\n\nSpending around four hours immersed in Gandhi’s world was an enriching experience. For anyone visiting Ahmedabad, Sabarmati Ashram is a must-visit—not just to admire history but to reflect on simplicity, truth, and inner strength."

I was fascinated by how each one of them are maintained in spic and span conditions.\nIt easily takes 90 minutes to go through every car and observe the detailing. If you are an automobile design enthusiast you will cherish all the moments spent here. The venue is in private property which houses residence of the owner. The residence landscape is nicely maintained which adds to the charm. There is also a restaurant inside which I didn’t try.\nI have deducted one star for the rude behaviour of the staff.  They seem to be guiding as if we are going to ruin the displays. I understand that many would be doing that but they get to understand customer experience especially when they are charging Rs 100 entry ticket. And additional Rs. 100 for every photography device."

The museum has an incredible collection of cars dating back to the late 1800s and early 1900s. From bullock-cart type cars to classic beauties from prestigious global brands, every vehicle is displayed with proper details like the year, maker, and country.\n\nThey also have iconic Indian cars such as the original Tata Nano and Maruti 800, along with a few vintage motorcycles. As an automobile enthusiast, I absolutely loved walking through the history and evolution of four-wheelers. It was fascinating to see how massive and beautifully designed old cars were compared to today’s compact models. The craftsmanship and design truly reflect the art and engineering of their time.\n\nTickets are required both for entry and for using your mobile camera. Initially, I felt the pricing was slightly on the higher side, but after seeing the rare collection and the way they’ve maintained these vehicles, it felt worth it. Do note that only one phone is allowed per photo ticket, security guards are present at every corner, and video recording is not allowed.\n\n👉 Best time to visit is around lunchtime, as there is a Vintage Theam Restaurant inside the premises where you can enjoy a nice meal. That way you can easily spend an entire afternoon exploring cars and relaxing over food.\n\nOverall, it was a crazy and satisfying experience. A must-visit for families, friends, and especially petrolheads who will appreciate every detail. Highly recommended!"

Its aesthetic views, exotic eatables and their rich heritage, makes it one of the most visited locations.

This quiet place acts as a getaway from the hubbubs of the chaotic city, while being located in the heart of the city. This lake is surrounded with thick lustrous green garden and the river side are embellished with various stones. At various occasions the water from Narmada River is allowed to flow into this river.\n\nThe round pathway along the river attracts many health-conscious people for morning jog or workout. Vastrapur Lake also acts as the cultural hub of the city, as many cultural events are organized on the lustrous green lawn along the river bank.\n\nThis place is an ideal weekend visit for a family picnic or maybe a small outing in the evening. This place is also ideal for children as it offers a children park especially designed for the amusement of the small humans. The park is open to its visitors every day from 8 am to 10 pm, no entry fees are charged to its visitors."

We did go and pray and also enjoyed the way the temple was constructed so beautifully. The entrance to the temple was simply superb construction wise.\n\nThey say it was built in the 18th century, and the temple faces west.\n\nWe went in the early morning hence the sun was directly the mob camera making the photos totally dark. So probably the good time to get good photos one must visit in the evening time say after 5 pm."

Some construction is still going on, so some debris is there near the construction area. Well worth a visit for the visual beauty & the peaceful ambience.\nQuite a large temple, photography is prohibited, which is always a downer for me."

              "reviewText": "Hutheesing Jain Temple, Ahmedabad – A Sanctuary of Serenity and Spiritual Grace\n\nNestled in the heart of Ahmedabad, the Hutheesing Jain Temple stands as a timeless tribute to devotion, architecture, and spiritual tranquility. As soon as you step through its intricately carved entrance, a deep sense of peace envelops you, offering immediate relief from the noise and rush of the outside world.\n\nBuilt in 1848 by a Jain merchant, Sheth Hutheesing, this temple is dedicated to the 15th Jain Tirthankara, Shri Dharmanatha. Crafted primarily from white marble, the temple is a marvel of design, with its delicate carvings, domed ceilings, and latticed windows casting intricate shadows that shift beautifully with the daylight. The sacred chants that gently echo through the sanctum enhance the divine ambience, encouraging reflection and inner calm.\n\nThe temple’s courtyard, adorned with 52 smaller shrines, creates a feeling of being surrounded by layers of devotion. Monks and worshippers move quietly, and the scent of incense lingers in the air, reinforcing a deeply meditative mood. Despite being a popular tourist attraction, the sanctity and serenity of the temple are remarkably preserved.\n\nWhat truly sets Hutheesing Temple apart is the way it combines the spiritual and the aesthetic. The fine craftsmanship is not just art—it’s an expression of faith. Whether you’re religious or simply in search of a tranquil experience, the temple offers a moment of stillness and connection that lingers long after your visit.\n\nIn a world full of distractions, the Hutheesing Jain Temple provides a rare and beautiful pause. It is not just a place of worship, but a space where one can reconnect—with self, silence, and the divine."

The place is calm, the sound of the river waves is very soothing, and the cool morning breeze makes it even better.\n\nAhmedabad can be quite hot, so visiting this place in the morning felt really peaceful. There’s a metro station around 2 km away, so it’s also easy to reach. The main riverfront area is open 24/7, but if you want to visit the Atal Bridge or garden area, they open after 9 AM.\n\nThere are trees all around, and you can even find bicycles nearby to ride, though they are a bit costly. Still, it’s a good experience, especially for visitors from outside the city.\nOverall, a great spot for a quiet walk or just to sit and relax in the fresh air."

It is no mean achievement to go five to six stories underground and build something like an ornate mall-like structure in an era absolutely devoid of heavy machinery, earth movers and electricity. A treat to the eyes stands here built just purely relying on human ingenuity and hard labour. It truly is one of the architectural wonders and marvels. It is nice to see it's well preserved and also maintained despite the dense population surrounding it. It would be nice if the water in the well is used regularly so that it doesn't become stagnant and murky."

              "reviewText": "Bai Harir Vav, also known as the Bai Harir Stepwell, is a stunning example of Indo-Islamic architecture located in Ahmedabad. Built in the 15th century, it served as a crucial water reservoir during a time of drought and showcases remarkable engineering.\n\nHighlights for Visitors:\n\nArchitecture: The stepwell features intricate carvings, pillars, and arches, highlighting the craftsmanship of the period. The detailed stonework and geometric patterns are particularly impressive.\n\nHistorical Significance: It reflects the engineering ingenuity of the time and is a testament to the importance of water conservation in arid regions.\n\nPhotography: The unique structure, especially when illuminated by sunlight filtering through the arches, provides excellent photography opportunities. Photography not permitted inside the mosque.\n\nAtmosphere: Bai Harir Vav offers an environment, ideal for exploration on non crowded days.\n\nTips for Visiting:\n\nBest Time to Visit: Early morning or late afternoon is ideal for pleasant weather and better lighting for photos.\n\nAccess: Be prepared for many stairs, unsafe ledges and uneven surfaces, as it's a stepwell with multiple levels. Many restrictions in the mosque area.\n\nRespect the Space: As a historical site, visitors should maintain decorum and respect the site's integrity.\n\nEntry is free although a person inside asks for \"tips\" apparently.\nBeautiful architecture. Much of the stone work is still fully intact. The mosque alongside alos has amazing stone carving.\nIts a bit away from main sites and the location isn't the best, but definitely worth visiting. One of the few places to figure Sanskrit with Persian and Islamic motifs with images of hindu gods and bells. Free to visit.\nLovely place in the bustling city of Ahmedabad! It's a place not known by many. And probably that's good because there is little crowd there. But wait, it is crowded by lot of llangurs. Probably the most I have seen at any place. The architecture is beautiful and it has 5 storey to it. We could only go till the 3rd storey beneath the ground."

Kasturbhai Lalbhai, a wellknown and prominent Ahmedabad based industrialist, and Jain Acharya Muni. Punyavijayji. Muni. Punyavijayji donated his personal collection of illustrated and un-illustrated manuscripts, bronzes and cloth paintings at time at the establishment of Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Indological Institute. With the passage of time the collection grew more and more prominent which created a need for an exclusive display of the artifacts. Thus, in 1984 a new building adjacent to the L.D. Institute of Indology was built by internationally acclaimed architect Shri. Balakrishna Doshi. The L.D. Museum was formally inaugurated by Shri. Brajkumar Nehru, the then Governor of Gujarat in 1985.\n\nLalbhai Dalpatbhai Museum is open from 10:30 AM in the morning till 5:30 PM in the evening on all days except for Mondays and public holidays. For group visits, the museum has to be informed earlier and can take a guided tour. There is no entry fee to visit Lalbhai Dalpatbhai Museum.\nThis houses a significant collection of Jain art, including sculptures, scrolls, manuscripts, and miniature paintings. Its architecture, designed by renowned architect Balkrishna Doshi, is notable for its integration of modernist and brutalist elements, with a focus on natural light and ventilation.\nThe Lalbhai Dalpatbhai (LD) Museum in Ahmedabad, India, is a case study in museum design and its connection to the preservation and display of cultural heritage\nOverall a very enriching experience.  Must visit."

The coin gallery and wooden artifacts are also fascinating. The place is Quiet and uncrowded. Extremely clean and well-curated. If you are lucky, you might find some peacock 🦚.\n\nI was told that there were Free guided tours available (ask at the desk)\n\nNo photography in some galleries, so check signs.\nWhether you're a history lover or just curious, this museum offers a deep dive into Gujarat's artistic and spiritual traditions in a peaceful setting. Definitely worth a couple of hours!"

The surrounding gardens offer a peaceful and calming atmosphere, making it a great place for a reflective visit. The 3D laser show is a definite highlight, providing a powerful and engaging narrative of the independence movement.\nHowever, a notable issue that detracts from the experience is the problem of rainwater leakage. During my visit, it was apparent that the auditorium and some areas of the museum were not immune to water seepage during heavy rains, which is a concern for the preservation of the building and its contents. While the memorial is a must-visit, this particular maintenance issue should be addressed to ensure the long-term integrity of this important historical site. Despite this, the memorial is an excellent tribute and well worth the visit for its educational and historical value."

It is a significant cultural and historical museum dedicated to the life and legacy of Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of independent India, known for his role in integrating India and his leadership during the freedom struggle.\n\nHere is a detailed review of the museum:\n\nLocation and History\n\nThe museum is housed in a heritage building called the Moti Shahi Mahal, which was originally built in the 16th century by Shah Jahan. The palace was later renovated and repurposed as a memorial to Sardar Patel. The museum opened in 1978 and has since served as an important center for historical education about Sardar Patel and the Indian independence movement.\n\nExhibits and Collections\n\nThe museum has a vast collection of items related to Sardar Patel’s life, as well as the broader context of India’s independence movement. Some of the key features include:\n\n1. Sardar Patel’s Life and Contributions:\n\nThe museum showcases personal items of Sardar Patel, including his letters, photographs, and documents.\n\nIt covers his early life, political career, and his critical role in the integration of princely states into the Indian Union after independence.\n\nDisplays include a detailed account of his contributions to the freedom struggle and his leadership in post-independence India.\n\n2. Galleries and Exhibits:\n\nThe museum has several galleries dedicated to different aspects of India’s history, such as the Indian National Movement, and the Integration of Princely States.\n\nThe most prominent exhibit is the “Iron Man of India” section, which is dedicated to Patel's personality and leadership qualities.\n\nArtifacts from Patel’s political career, such as his correspondence with other leaders of the time (including Mahatma Gandhi), and historical documents are carefully preserved here.\n\n3. Interactive Displays and Audio-Visuals:\n\nThe museum has well-curated displays of photographs, sculptures, and paintings.\n\nThe museum employs audio-visuals to engage visitors and explain the historical events surrounding the life of Patel and his era.\n\n4. Sardar Patel's Role in the Integration of India:\n\nThere is an emphasis on Patel’s strategic role in convincing princely states to join the Indian Union post-independence. This exhibit is particularly insightful, explaining how Patel’s diplomacy and leadership ensured the political unity of India.\n\n5. The Role of the Police in Indian Freedom Struggle:\n\nThe museum also has an interesting section dedicated to Gujarat Police's involvement in India’s freedom struggle, showcasing the contributions of the police forces in maintaining law and order during the turbulent times.\n\n6. Personal Belongings:\n\nThe museum displays Patel’s personal belongings such as his clothes, accessories, and other memorabilia, which adds a personal touch to the exhibits.\n\n7. Relics from the Mahatma's Movement:\n\nThe museum features important documents and artifacts from the Gandhi Movement, particularly focusing on Patel's close collaboration with Mahatma Gandhi during the freedom struggle.\n\nArchitectural Significance\n\nThe museum is housed in a beautiful building that is itself a historical landmark. The Moti Shahi Mahal has a blend of traditional Gujarati and Islamic architectural styles. The intricately carved wooden windows, ornate arches, and a grand entrance make it an architectural marvel.\n\nThe building’s design includes wide courtyards, spacious halls, and high ceilings, creating a grand yet inviting atmosphere. The traditional architectural elements complement the artifacts inside and enhance the overall visitor experience.\n\nVisitor Experience\n\nThe museum is well-maintained and organized, offering a good flow for visitors to move through the exhibits without feeling crowded. The displays are well-labelled, and some sections are interactive, making it engaging for visitors of all ages.\n\nThe museum provides detailed and informat"

It’s a hidden gem surrounded by local residences and the lively old bazaar, offering a unique blend of history and everyday life.\n\nWhat Makes It Special:\n•\tIntricate Architecture: The beautiful windows with intricate carvings and neglected yet charming structures give it a timeless aura. It’s a treat for architecture enthusiasts and photographers.\n•\tHidden Location: The site is well-hidden and not overly crowded, adding to its charm as a peaceful escape amidst the chaos of Manek Chowk.\n\nThings to Note:\n•\tNeglect and Maintenance: Unfortunately, the structures are not well-maintained, and the surrounding area can feel a bit neglected.\n•\tAccessibility: You can’t take your car here—it’s best to park on the main road and explore the area on foot. Walking through the narrow lanes of the old bazaar is an experience in itself.\n•\tAsk for Directions: Don’t rely solely on Google Maps. It’s better to ask locals for directions, as the area can be tricky to navigate.\n\nTips:\n•\tCombine your visit with a stroll through the old bazaar and enjoy the food and vibe of Manek Chowk.\n•\tBe prepared for some walking, and take your time exploring this hidden slice of Ahmedabad’s history.\n\nIf you’re a lover of history and hidden treasures, Rani no Hajiro is worth the visit despite its challenges. It’s a glimpse into the city’s rich past amidst its thriving present!"

The historical monument itself appears somewhat shabby. However, look beyond the exterior and you'll discover a hidden gem for unique women's accessories.\n\nTreasure Trove of Trinkets\n\nThe area surrounding the tomb is a haven for budget-friendly shopping. Here, you'll find a variety of shops selling everything from stunning handcrafted accessories (starting as low as ₹50!) to beautiful dupattas and chaniya cholis. The selection is truly impressive, and I personally found myself drawn to the unique pieces, ultimately leaving with a collection worth ₹2,000.\n\nEssentials and Refreshment\n\nWhile exploring the shops, you'll also find refreshment stalls offering a quick pick-me-up. Public restrooms are available for a small fee, but be warned – their cleanliness might leave something to be desired.\n\nFood Paradise Nearby\n\nAfter your shopping spree, head to the nearby Manek Chowk, a foodie's paradise, for a delightful and well-deserved meal. Don't forget to put your bargaining skills to the test here as well!\n\nThings to Keep in Mind\n\nWhile Rano no Hajiro offers a unique shopping experience, there are a few things to consider:\n\nCondition of the Monument: The historical structure itself is not well-maintained and may appear neglected.\nBasic Amenities: Public restrooms are available but might not be the cleanest.\nRecommendation:\n\nRani no Hajiro is perfect for those seeking one-of-a-kind accessories at affordable prices. However, if you're expecting a pristine historical site, you might be disappointed.\n\nSo, if you're an adventurous shopper who can overlook the monument's condition, head to Rani no Hajiro and unleash your inner bargain hunter! Just remember to factor in a post-shopping meal at the vibrant Manek Chowk!\n\nTo know more detailed reviews about food, follow me on Instagram - foodwith_rumbumm and for travel rumbum_vlogs"

But unfortunately this place is not preserved properly, it's in very poor condition few people have encroached inside and outside of complex, kids playing cricket inside, people sleeping at entrance,\nHow will tourist come to such places ???\n\nno attention and proper information displayed by ASI despite the site is around 500 years old. It's shocking.\n\nWe need to preserve our history we can't change it. Even if we don't like it.\n\nMust visit for all. If more tourists come may be ASI will pay more attention,\nBest way is to charge 25 Rs as a entry ticket."

There's also a peaceful botanical garden and shaded picnic areas.\n\nThe walking trails and riverside views are relaxing, and the atmosphere is close to nature. It’s both informative and enjoyable. Do carry your own food and water, as food options are limited. Overall, a great place to spend 3–5 hours amidst nature."

This place is not just a park but also a education hub that offers past dinosour fossil and many more. The entry ticket price is not high only 8 rs per child and 30 rs for adults is affordable price for everyone. It is forbidden to carry anything inside the park except water bottles and there are no food and drink stalls inside. The best time to go is in the morning as there is a lot of walking which will tire you out. This zoo is well maintained by the staff and has created a safe and healthy environment for the animals. It will take approximately 3 to 4 hours to explore Nature Park thoroughly. If you are planning to gandhinagar than must visit this park. You will get the good vibes here n Good amazing destination for photographers also 📸\nHighly Recommended 📍"

The park offers an abundance of natural beauty, with greenery spread across vast areas, creating a calm and peaceful environment for visitors. The sight of peacocks freely moving around the park was truly delightful and added a unique charm to the surroundings. Additionally, the dinosaur sculptures were very impressive, well-designed, and engaging, especially for children, making the park both educational and entertaining.\n\nWhile the visit was enjoyable, I would like to share a few observations for improvement. One of the major concerns is the absence of a proper map or clear guidance for visitors. Without directional boards and signages at key points, it becomes difficult to navigate the large park area, which can sometimes cause confusion and inconvenience. A simple visitor map and more visible signboards would greatly enhance the overall experience.\n\nAnother aspect that could be reconsidered is the food policy. While I fully appreciate and support the ban on plastic, the restriction on carrying fruits or baby food creates challenges for families with infants and young children. Allowing baby food or basic fruit items, with proper checking, would make the visit much more convenient for parents.\n\nLastly, the staff support could be more approachable and visitor-friendly. A little more guidance, courtesy, and assistance from the staff would add immense value to the visitor experience.\n\nIndroda Park is undoubtedly a gem of natural and educational attractions, but with a few improvements in facilities and services, it can become even more visitor-friendly and enjoyable. I sincerely hope the management considers these suggestions for enhancing the comfort and satisfaction of future visitors."

              "reviewText": "The Amdavad ni Gufa was built during my final years at CEPT, a time when it captured the imagination of every student. Its cave-like form was mesmerizing, not just for its concept but also for its unconventional construction techniques, particularly the use of ferrocement.\n\nColleagues who had worked at B.V. Doshi’s office shared fascinating insights—Doshi, the visionary Pritzker Prize-winning architect, would often sketch directly on-site, and the team would build from those sketches. The steps leading to the Gufa’s entrance, they say, were first marked directly on the ground, constructed, and only then documented into drawings.\n\nThe shimmering china mosaic domes were a source of fascination for students. It was commonly referred to as the \"Doshi-Hussain Gufa,\" though originally named \"Hussain-Doshi Gufa\" before it was dedicated to the people of Ahmedabad and rechristened \"Amdavad ni Gufa.\"\n\nAt the back, a door and pathway evoke images of Indus Valley Civilization structures unearthed at Lothal and Mohenjodaro, with a ramp descending into the earth. The intricate designs on the door grills add to its enigmatic charm.\n\nA building with no defined purpose—simply a place to sit, read, and reflect. M.F. Hussain had painted spontaneous, sketch-like figures on the interior domes, though nothing substantial. Some of his cutout drawings remain, adding to the ambiance. Children are particularly enthralled by the mysterious structure. For years, they were allowed to play atop the domes, but recently, this has been restricted to preserve the aging china mosaic.\n\nA marvel of architecture, the Gufa stands strong—though perhaps in the near future, it may require thoughtful restoration to preserve its legacy."

The combination of B.V. Doshi's design and M.F. Husain's artwork gives it a lot of cultural value, and it's great for people who are into modern art or unusual spaces.\n\nThe place felt a bit under-maintained, and there wasn't much context or information about the art inside. It's a quick visit - maybe 20-30 minutes - unless you're into taking photos or sketching. Also, the lighting inside can be too dim to properly appreciate the artwork.\n\nThe area around the Gufa is nice though, with a chill café and a creative vibe thanks to nearby students and artists."

Literally nothing was visible, spotted the same animals over and over in different overcrowded cages.\n\nThere was no proper route guide, no staff in sight, nobody to guide.\n\nIn general. Please shut this place and relocate these poor animals to their natural habitat. I can’t see the animals, the animals live in poor condition and can’t see us. This is benefiting nobody."

Gujarat is synonymous with kite flying during the Uttarayan festival. During this time of the year, the sky is rendered colorful with kites flying all over the sky in unimaginable sizes, shapes, & color. Irrespective of caste, creed, or religion, Gujaratis fly kites during this festival. The museum is located within Sanskar Kendra, designed by Le Corbusier. It is mentioned that the thought of setting up such a museum came to Sri. Bhanubhai Shah when he gave away his collection of kites to Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, which also incidentally manages the place. The museum also has display of several historical aspects of kite flying since the ancient times. It's astonishing to read about the different types of kites from other parts of the world & how this art has evolved over the ages. The museum is easily accessible by different modes of transport. Overall, a beautiful place to visit with kids. 👌👌🇮🇳🇮🇳"

Its combination of brick and concrete creates a softened look which contrasts with the Brutalist Tagore Hall opposite the museum. Currently, the museum is closed due to a major need for restoration, as it is quite dilapidated, due to the concrete planters breaking off or having been pulled for safety reasons. It was poorly made at an early stage, so it wasn’t able to last long."

Housed in the historic Gool Lodge, once owned by Bachuben Nagarwala—the city's first trained beautician and hairstylist—this space offers a profound journey through various facets of discord and reconciliation.\n\nThe museum features several thought-provoking installations:\n\nConflict Timeline: Chronicles Gujarat's history of conflicts since 1960, providing deep insights into the state's past.\n\nGallery of Disputes: Utilizes animal allegories to depict societal conflicts, drawing inspiration from works like the 'Panchatantra' and George Orwell's 'Animal Farm.'\n\nEmpathy Alley: Showcases silhouettes of influential leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi and Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, accompanied by recordings of their impactful speeches.\n\nMoral Compass: Allows visitors to engage directly with a pre-1977 copy of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the importance of understanding our rights and duties.\n\nMemory Lab: Encourages guests to share personal stories of conflict, fostering a sense of community and understanding.\n\nSorry Tree: A poignant installation where visitors can leave notes of apology, promoting healing and forgiveness.\n\nLocated opposite R.C. High School of Commerce near Chalte Peer Ni Dargah in Mirzapur, visitors can conveniently park their vehicles at the nearby parking area and cross the road to reach the museum.\n\nThe Conflictorium is open from Tuesday to Sunday, 11:00 AM to 8:00 PM, and offers free entry. It's a must-visit for anyone interested in exploring societal issues through art and interactive exhibits.\n\nThis museum not only educates but also inspires introspection, making it a unique and invaluable experience in Ahmedabad.\""

He took the time to explain everything to me in great detail, ensuring I fully understood every aspect.During my visit, I also attended an event titled \"Lost and Found in Space,\" an interactive and performative session led by Abhishek Kukreja. This session delved into how we access spaces and how these spaces shape our beliefs, memories, desires, identities, and even our transgressions.Abhishek Kukreja has extensive experience teaching and conducting workshops in film, theatre, cultural studies, and creative arts. As an educator at the Conflictorium, he is dedicated to promoting critical thinking and art appreciation through engaging dialogues and workshops.I highly recommend that everyone visit this place to experience the thought-provoking events and workshops they offer.\n\nAnd above photo is From \"Field to Frame: Grounding Collective Practices in the Outdoors\" arrenging by Raju Patel from Vadodara and all other artists"

They have a staging area where they have an entertainment and then a food area with kitchen views.  It is outdoor restaurant with options to eat under a roof or open under a tree. The food was amazing not over spiced. Mostly indian restaurant have very spicy food to the point where we can't taste the food but this place had a beautiful blend of spices and many varieties."

It has a very authentic style, beautifully built in and around nature, giving it a cozy vibe of its own. Still, I won't go 5-stars because we found a tiny piece of dish-washing wire scrubber and hair in the soup."

For a place known for its cultural richness, a few more authentic items or seasonal specialties could’ve elevated the experience. That said, the ambiance is beautiful, offering a true feel of a Gujarati-Rajasthani village, with rustic decor and peaceful surroundings. It’s a great place to sit, relax, and soak in the traditional vibes after dinner. Worth a visit for the atmosphere, but hoping for more variety next time."

The food was absolutely delicious, with every item on the plate prepared authentically and served with warmth. The ambience of the place is another highlight – rustic, serene, and truly reflective of Gujarat’s cultural heritage.\n\nOne suggestion from our experience: the thali includes a wide variety of dishes, often more than one can consume in a single meal. While this generosity is appreciated, it can sometimes lead to food wastage, especially when diners are unable to finish everything. A thoughtful approach could be to serve a basic minimum set of dishes initially, and then offer additional items based on individual preference or request. This could help reduce food wastage without compromising the guest experience.\n\nOverall, it was a memorable dining experience – excellent food, great service, and a wonderful setting. Highly recommended for anyone who wants to relish authentic Gujarati cuisine in a traditional ambience."

The Kit Kat shake was also delicious and had a nice consistency. However, the mocktails were a bit of a letdown and could use some improvement in terms of taste and presentation. The ambiance was cozy, making it a nice spot to hang out. With a little work on the mocktails, this place has great potential!"

Not upto the price & mark in Ahmedabad, hope you work on the food quality rest talking about the ambience & extra games to play along is good but need to work on the food quality please 🫣"

The indoor environment is pleasant, enhanced by unique sealing lamps.\n\n--> Taste:- I would rate the food a 7.8/10. We ordered four items: classic Margherita, signature Cold coffee, watermelon juice, and chocolate pancakes with maple syrup (contains egg).\n\n• Classic Margherita: The thin crust was topped with large slices of tomato but lacked sufficient Szechuan sauce.\n\n• Signature Cold Coffee:- This was quite unremarkable.\n\n• Watermelon Juice:- Completely fresh and natural, I would rate it 5/5.\n\n• Chocolate Pancakes: Served with guava and apple pieces. Along with maple syrup and vanilla ice cream, these were enjoyable.\n\n--> Staff and Customer Service:- We really appreciated the demeanor of the manager and staff there. They spoke to us with a lot of humility and addressed our problems with a smile, providing solutions. The waiter who served our food appeared to be quite experienced and had excellent skills in interacting with customers. When my friend accidentally spilled juice, the waiter cleaned it up without showing any annoyance, simply saying, \"No worries, it happens.\" After cleaning, he even asked my friend if she was okay?, which truly brightened our day.\n\nWhile we found the prices a bit high for the taste, outstanding customer service definitely makes us want to visit again."

My friend wanted to try a brownie shake but was told all their brownies contain egg, so he went with another shake, which turned out to be overly sweet – we had to ask them to replace it.

              "reviewText": "The Blue Oven at Bodakdev delivers an experience that blends authenticity with a relaxed, cozy vibe. I visited recently, and the overall experience was delightful.\n\nThe place serves authentic Italian-style pizza, and you can truly feel the difference — right from the dough to the perfectly balanced toppings. The 'make your own pizza' option is a fun and interactive touch that makes the meal even more special.\n\n✨ Taste: Every bite feels fresh and flavorful. Their use of real Italian herbs, wood-fired base, and minimal oil makes the food both tasty and light.\n\n👨‍🍳 Service: Staff is polite, quick, and well-informed. They guide you well while customizing pizzas or picking from the menu.\n\n💰 Price: Reasonable for the quality and ambiance — around ₹600 for two. Not super cheap, but worth every rupee.\n\n🍝 Variety: From classic Margherita to Smoky Chicken or Pepperoni, their menu covers wide Italian bases — pastas, garlic breads, salads, and even refreshing beverages like Mint Mojito.\n\n✔️ Authenticity: This isn't your regular Indo-Italian fusion pizza. The crust, the cheese, and the sauces truly stand out as authentic Italian.\n\nA must-visit for pizza lovers who want something beyond the usual franchise taste!\""

I know it sounds cheesy but hey, that's what they serve.\n\nI honestly had the best Mozzarella and Parmesan at this place.\n\nService was phenomenal, they have this ring system where you just have to press a button and they will assist you, and it was necessary as this place has floors.\n\nLet's talk food - The Skinny Margherita has amazing balance of Marinara sauce, Mozzarella and basil leaves. Tear & Share garlic bread was a little bland but you can season it yourself a bit. 4 cheese pizza was just okay-ish. What won my heart was Penne Primavera and Avocado on Toast. Rich smooth texture of Avocado with crispy toast was wonderful and cherry tomato was literally cherry on top.\n\nBut Ambience is the reason why I'll visit again. You can enjoy your food and have a private conversation with your date or family. Soft lightning feels very cozy and makes you want to stay longer, although during peak hours it does get crowded a bit, for best first experience, visit by 7PM-8PM.\n\nOverall, I loved this place and I shall continue to try other items on menu as they seems to amaze me every time.\n\nRatings: 4.2/5. Loved it."

However, the service definitely needs improvement. Basic things like getting drinking water or extra plates took repeated reminders (3-4 times), which shouldn’t be the case in any dine-in experience. It felt like we had to manage a lot on our own.\n\nThe atmosphere was just okay. It was very crowded and quite noisy, so not ideal if you’re looking for a peaceful dining environment. The washroom was also disappointing unclean and with a strong smell, which brings down the overall experience.\n\nConsidering the per person cost is ₹500, I expected better hospitality and hygiene. Hope the management works on improving service quality and cleanliness. The food alone isn’t enough to bring customers back consistently."

The fries are different from the regular ones, as they are made with skin of the potato left, which adds to the crunch. Baked beans on toast is just excellent with a thick toasted bread and a generous amount of cream cheese.\n\nCoffee is good (though I'd have liked more options). The lotus biscoff cheesecake is something to die for. Too good.\n\nOverall, its an excellent breakfast spot."

The compact space makes the coffee smell spread like thin air every time they brew. I just loved the taste.\nWe ordered\n- Cappuccino ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n- Croissant ⭐️⭐️\n- Bocconcini Micro greens and Cherry Tomatoes Toast ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n\nThe toast with finger-lickingly delicious. I adored every single bite of it. The side salad was even better. It made me desire their salad, but well, perhaps the next time. The had crisp wedges which was a healthy option for the children.\nThe coffee was good too. Everything was value for money. However, the croissant was too soft and not up to the mark. I was particularly looking forward to this one.\n\nThe vibe picks up with the sunset. My friend mentioned how it reminds her of Pondicherry’s cafe culture. It is a good place to work too.\n\nThe service is good. The server was attentive to our needs."

It hurts to see that this garden which is situated in such a posh area has such poor management! There should be fine in producing waste and making the place dirty, there should be awareness on cleanliness. Every Sunday when there are maximum visitors, cleanliness drives should be held so that visitors and especially children understand the importance of cleanliness. There should be CCTV cameras so, that no one throws waste in the park. Increase Dustbins in the park."

However, the garden gets quite crowded in the evening. The nearby BRTS stop adds to the convenience of reaching the place easily. Overall, a great spot for relaxation and fresh air!"

She invited me to join a group of 50 students to explore the place and gain knowledge.\n\nThe visit was an enriching experience, offering a perfect blend of education and entertainment. The interactive exhibits, live demonstrations, and advanced science models made complex concepts easy to understand. The Space and Astronomy section was particularly fascinating, showcasing detailed information about the universe. The Aquatic Gallery and Robotics Exhibition were also highlights, providing an engaging and hands-on experience.\n\nThe infrastructure of Science City is well-maintained, with spacious galleries and well-organized displays. The staff was helpful in explaining various exhibits, making the learning process even more enjoyable. The students had an exciting time, actively participating in different activities.\n\nOverall, Science City is a must-visit for anyone interested in science and innovation. It serves as a great educational destination for students and adults alike, offering a fun way to learn about scientific advancements. I truly enjoyed the experience and would highly recommend it!"

I chose Combo 1, which cost around ₹345 per person and covered many key attractions (the app even has a built-in map that shows where to go next).\n\nI’d suggest reaching around 12–1 pm, especially since it’s a huge complex and there’s quite a bit of walking. If you’re not up for too much walking, they offer golf carts for a small fee—definitely useful.\n\nHighlights for me:\n•\tThrill ride—a fun, must-try experience.\n•\tAquarium—absolutely amazing, especially the shark tunnel and penguins.\n•\tRobotics gallery—great learning experience, interesting to see all the robot displays.\n•\tPlant section (Life Science Park)—so many species, really peaceful.\n•\tNature Park—incredible, but huge—I couldn’t cover everything in one go.\n\nPerfect place for kids to learn and explore—blend of fun, science, and nature. Highly recommend visiting!”\n\n⸻\n\nWhy This Works\n•\tPersonal & clear: It sounds conversational and easy to read.\n•\tActionable tips: Mentions buying via app with combos, timing advice, and golf carts.\n•\tHighlights variety: Covers rides, aquarium, robotics, plant section, and nature park.\n•\tInviting tone: Emphasizes it’s great for kids and families."

There are so many options for food and different cuisines offered so there is something for everyone. We ordered some dumplings, chilli oil noodles, veg sushi and buns. Everything was pretty good, but maybe not the best I've tried in the city. I would still recommend a visit if you and your party want to try something new and different."

We also tried the Sichuan Cracker Cottage Cheese Bao and Litchi Basil Tiki Tuki, and they were simply amazing! The chef’s dedication to quality and taste shines through every bite. The love and passion that the owner has poured into this place are evident in every detail. If you haven’t visited yet, you’re missing out on an exceptional culinary experience.

They also did not provide me a shezwan sauce. The quantity was so less that my stomach is half full. And if you order from Chinese wok in 250Rs same burned garlic rice 2 people can have easily. So I don't recommend this restaurant. It's waste of money."

While the atmosphere is delightful, the food quality varies not up to the mark. The pizza is underwhelming and lacks the expected flavors, while the self-made nachos fall short of expectations. However, the quesadilla is flavorful, and the avocado spaghetti is an absolute highlight with its creamy, rich taste. The Dora cake is another standout, perfectly balancing buttercream and cake for a satisfying dessert. Despite some inconsistencies, Maxicano by the Bay is suitable for one time  visit for its ambiance and select dishes."

Although nachos has that beans in it which I don't prefer much.\nSomehow quesadilla was not available in jain. Although my friends have ordered regular one- oozing grilled three cheese quesadilla and found okay.\nDrinks were normal.\n\nThe ambience was great but the atmosphere was little down despite of music as it was noisy due to the crowd.\n\nService was alright. It took reasonable time in serving all."

While the ambience was quite pleasant and the location near the riverfront makes it a great place to hang out after dinner, I found the food to be a bit bland in taste. It’s a nice spot if you’re looking for a calm dining experience with a good vibe, but the flavors could use some improvement"

However, this year has been quite disappointing. The sophistication and charm that once defined the club seem to have diminished. Since Covid, there have been few major events, and those that were organized lacked proper management.\n\nToday’s Sharad Purnima event (a paid one) was particularly disheartening. The atmosphere felt chaotic, with attendees crowding the food stalls as if it were a free food drive. It was a far cry from the well-organized and elegant events I’ve come to expect from the club prior to the pandemic. I’m unsure if the new management is to blame, but this experience is certainly not what long-standing members like myself have invested in. I wish the member see and analyze, is this the service we deserved after paying lacs for the membership. And the hilarious thing is the management at the front desk confidently says now the club has become 7 star. To be honest, this experience doesn’t even lead to getting 1 star for the club.\n\nI sincerely hope the management takes this feedback constructively and focuses on addressing these issues, rather than dismissing them. I am more than willing to pay for quality experiences, but this felt disrespectful to members who have supported the club for years."

This hotel was so nasty, the room was covered in dust and the pillows were stained yellow. Our bathroom had a blurred window which was scratched so someone can see straight into our shower, the bathroom always smells bad. The night stands were glued, door handles were rusted. Linens and towels were dirty. Overall it was pretty bad, nasty and smelly place. I would  not recommend this to anyone."

For many years, it was synonymous with lavish events, particularly weddings and grand receptions, setting a benchmark for elegance and exclusivity in the city's social calendar. There was a definite time when choosing the Golden Glory Hall meant you were guaranteed a top-tier, luxurious experience, marked by impeccable service and a prestigious address.\n\nThe hall itself remains impressively spacious, easily accommodating large gatherings, which is still a significant advantage for substantial events. The overall ambiance of Karnavati Club, with its established reputation and excellent amenities, certainly adds to the appeal of the Golden Hall. Its convenient location and ample parking facilities continue to be strong positive points, making it a practical choice for many.\n\nHowever, the landscape of event venues in Ahmedabad has transformed dramatically in recent years. A multitude of newer, purpose-built banquet halls and convention centers have emerged, boasting cutting-edge designs, state-of-the-art technology, and highly customizable spaces. When compared to these modern contenders, the Golden glory Hall, while still well-maintained, can sometimes feel a little dated in its decor and amenities. The sheer opulence and contemporary sophistication offered by some of the city's newer venues often outshine what was once considered peak luxury at the Golden glory Hall. They often feature more advanced audiovisual setups, innovative lighting, and fresh, trending aesthetic concepts that the Golden glory Hall, in its current form, might struggle to match.\n\nIn essence, the Golden Hall at Karnavati Club remains a reliable and functional venue, especially for those who value the club's esteemed legacy, reputation, and convenient location. It's a solid choice for traditional celebrations. However, for those seeking the very latest in modern luxury, cutting-edge facilities, and a truly contemporary, grand aesthetic, Ahmedabad now offers a wider array of options that might be more aligned with current trends and expectations. It's a good hall with a rich history, but the market has evolved with more contemporary and luxurious offerings."

The prices are of course on the higher side but the quality justifies the same.\n\nWe tried the most famous deep dish pizza for which we went for, along with farmer’s tear and share bread and many more other things. Worth visiting the place once."

We tried their Hot Chocolate, Cafe Latte, Mocha and Avocado Cheese Croissant. The croissant and its filling was soft, fresh, cheesy and decadent. We loved every bite of it as the ingredients used were clearly fresh and tasted great.\n\nThe Ambience and interiors are modern as well which adds to the mood. Overall a 4/5 star cafe. They have a large set of variety in snacks, beverages and deserts which I find to be appealing to a wide audience of differing food palette."

While bakeries pop up frequently, this one has truly carved a special place in my heart. For me, a visit here isn't just about the delectable pastries; it's about the joy of selecting a perfect treat to brighten a friend's day or bring a smile to a family member's face. It's an edible expression of love, and that's something truly unique.\nThe ambiance is wonderfully contradictory – a vibrant buzz fills the air, yet there's an undeniable sense of calm that allows you to relax and savor the moment. It's the kind of place where conversations flow easily amidst the happy chatter.\n\nYes, the prices lean towards the higher side, but honestly, the quality and the overall experience make it worth that occasional splurge. Think of it as an investment in a little slice of happiness, perfect for a monthly treat or a special occasion."

From the moment you step in, you're transported to a quaint French corner - full of charm, warmth, and artistic detail.
