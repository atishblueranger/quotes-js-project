Nestled quietly along the banks of the serene Sabarmati River in Ahmedabad, this ashram-once home to Mahatma Gandhi from 1917 to 1930-is a living testimony to India's freedom struggle.\n\nThough Ahmedabad has grown into a bustling city, the path to the ashram still holds a certain calm. Passing through well-developed riverfront roads adorned with parks and gardens, we reached the 'Magan Gandhi Gate'-a quieter entrance. Despite being a weekend, the ashram remained calm and uncrowded, amplifying its aura of peace and simplicity.\n\nInside, the shady trees, humble buildings, and displays of Gandhi's life and tools, especially inside Magan Nivas and Hriday Kunj, evoke deep reflection. Each corner, from prayer grounds to Gandhi's study and sleeping quarters, feels sacred and grounded in history. Handwritten notes, rare photographs, and even traditional spinning wheels offer a quiet glimpse into the soul of the Mahatma.\n\nThe peaceful ambiance, chirping birds, and even the sight of graceful peacocks wandering in the lawns add to the spiritual feel of the place. It was deeply moving to walk through the places where Bapu meditated, wrote letters, spun khadi, and led a movement that changed the destiny of a nation.\n\nSpending around four hours immersed in Gandhi's world was an enriching experience. For anyone visiting Ahmedabad, Sabarmati Ashram is a must-visit-not just to admire history but to reflect on simplicity, truth, and inner strength.",

There's a metro station around 2 km away, so it's also easy to reach. The main riverfront area is open 24/7, but if you want to visit the Atal Bridge or garden area, they open after 9 AM.\n\nThere are trees all around, and you can even find bicycles nearby to ride, though they are a bit costly.

Ladies are not allowed inside the mosque.\n\nMosque is quiet small and compact, but highlights the beauty of the indo islamic architecture.\n\nBuilt in the year 1572-73 by an Abyssinian (person from Ethiopia) called Sidi Saiyyed, who served under the then sultan. This mosque is well known for the wonderful intricate carvings in stone and their unique semi circular tracery windows, depicting the tree of life.\n\nPaper cutouts were made of the carved screens from which two wooden replicas were made and these are now in museum in London and New york.\n\nThe driver was telling us that this mosque is still in use as the emblem of the Ahmedabad municipality.\n\nThe grave of sidi saiyyed is inside this mosque.\n\nThe mosque is in a congested area, hence parking is out of the question. Definitely worth a visit to admire the wonderful jalli work in the windows.",

Felt so happy we could visit this place and admire the beauty of it.\n\nStepwells are basically wells for washing, drinking and bathing purely for the ladies and it is very common in Gujarat and rajasthan area. The earliest step wells date back to 2nd century AD.\n\nOver time, these step wells became an architectural marvel and wonderful place to show case their talent, their intricate carvings, their stunning symmetry. It is a wonderful place not only  for history lovers but for photographers too.\n\nThe Rudabhai step well is a five storied step well, built in 1498 by the then king Rana veer singh but completed in record time by Mohammed Begda the muslim ruler who killed Rana veer singh in battle.\n\nLegend says, the queen Rudabhai tricked mohammed begda to finish the step well in record time on the condition that she will marry him, but when the step well was completed, she went back on her promise and killed her self in this step well.\n\nYou can also see some tombs on the step well and the legend goes that the mohammed begda killed the people who constructed such a fantastic step well in record time.\n\nDefinitely a must visit place if you are visiting Gujarat and in particular Ahmedabad. The place is more beautiful when you see it with your own eyes than in the photographs that you see on the net.",

The complex houses beautiful tombs of kings and queens, showcasing amazing historical significance. I was particularly impressed by the grand and picturesque lake that enhances the serene atmosphere of this ancient site.\n\nThe architecture is fascinating with its unique stylistic elements. The open courtyard provides a wonderful space to appreciate the intricate details of the structure and offers great photo opportunities. The exquisite lattice work and carved pillars throughout the complex are truly mesmerizing, especially when sunlight filters through.\n\nImportant note: You must remove your footwear before entering the complex, which can be uncomfortable as the ground gets very hot and dirty. I strongly recommend wearing socks as mentioned in the guidelines. Also, avoid visiting during rainy days as the experience will be compromised, and extremely hot days can make the visit unbearable since you'll be walking barefoot on hot surfaces.\n\nDespite these minor inconveniences, Sarkhej Roza is definitely worth visiting for its historical significance and architectural beauty if you plan your visit during comfortable weather conditions.",

Situated within the Sidi Bashir Mosque complex, these minarets are renowned for their unique shaking phenomenon. When one minaret is shaken, the other starts shaking on its own despite being connected by intricate arches and corridors. This perplexing optical illusion has puzzled visitors for centuries and remains an unsolved mystery to this day.",

Its cave-like form was mesmerizing, not just for its concept but also for its unconventional construction techniques, particularly the use of ferrocement.\n\nColleagues who had worked at B.V. Doshi's office shared fascinating insights-Doshi, the visionary Pritzker Prize-winning architect, would often sketch directly on-site, and the team would build from those sketches. The steps leading to the Gufa's entrance, they say, were first marked directly on the ground, constructed, and only then documented into drawings.\n\nThe shimmering china mosaic domes were a source of fascination for students. It was commonly referred to as the \"Doshi-Hussain Gufa,\" though originally named \"Hussain-Doshi Gufa\" before it was dedicated to the people of Ahmedabad and rechristened \"Amdavad ni Gufa.\"\n\nAt the back, a door and pathway evoke images of Indus Valley Civilization structures unearthed at Lothal and Mohenjodaro, with a ramp descending into the earth. The intricate designs on the door grills add to its enigmatic charm.\n\nA building with no defined purpose-simply a place to sit, read, and reflect. M.F. Hussain had painted spontaneous, sketch-like figures on the interior domes, though nothing substantial. Some of his cutout drawings remain, adding to the ambiance. Children are particularly enthralled by the mysterious structure. For years, they were allowed to play atop the domes, but recently, this has been restricted to preserve the aging china mosaic.\n\nA marvel of architecture, the Gufa stands strong-though perhaps in the near future, it may require thoughtful restoration to preserve its legacy.",

It's a hidden gem surrounded by local residences and the lively old bazaar, offering a unique blend of history and everyday life.\n\nWhat Makes It Special:\n•\tIntricate Architecture: The beautiful windows with intricate carvings and neglected yet charming structures give it a timeless aura. It's a treat for architecture enthusiasts and photographers.\n•\tHidden Location: The site is well-hidden and not overly crowded, adding to its charm as a peaceful escape amidst the chaos of Manek Chowk.\n\nThings to Note:\n•\tNeglect and Maintenance: Unfortunately, the structures are not well-maintained, and the surrounding area can feel a bit neglected.\n•\tAccessibility: You can't take your car here-it's best to park on the main road and explore the area on foot. Walking through the narrow lanes of the old bazaar is an experience in itself.\n•\tAsk for Directions: Don't rely solely on Google Maps. It's better to ask locals for directions, as the area can be tricky to navigate.\n\nTips:\n•\tCombine your visit with a stroll through the old bazaar and enjoy the food and vibe of Manek Chowk.\n•\tBe prepared for some walking, and take your time exploring this hidden slice of Ahmedabad's history.\n\nIf you're a lover of history and hidden treasures, Rani no Hajiro is worth the visit despite its challenges. It's a glimpse into the city's rich past amidst its thriving present!",
