The natural beauty of the park provided a stunning backdrop for the event-open skies, fresh air, and just enough greenery to make the whole experience feel surreal.\n\nThe sound system was top-notch, delivering deep bass and crisp highs that carried beautifully through the open space. The lighting setup was equally impressive, with lasers, strobes, and ambient visuals that perfectly matched the vibe of the music. The DJs kept the crowd moving all night with a well-curated mix of tracks that ranged from melodic to downright intense.\n\nOne thing that stood out was how well-organized everything was. Entry was smooth, there were plenty of food and drink stalls, and the security team did a great job of keeping things safe without being overbearing. The crowd was diverse and friendly, and the overall atmosphere felt inclusive and welcoming.\n\nDancing under the stars to some of the best techno music I've heard live was an unforgettable experience. Everyone seemed to be in high spirits, and you could feel the shared appreciation for music and connection.\n\nLasser Valley Park proved to be an ideal venue for a concert of this scale. I genuinely hope this becomes a recurring event because it set a new standard for outdoor music festivals. Hats off to the organizers for pulling off such a fantastic night.",

It is an urban park offering a rose garden, picnic spots, a cafe and a fountain with musical water shows.\nThere is no entry fee to Leisure Valley Park . A musical fountain is operated in the evenings. It is at a short walking distance from the IFFCO Chowk Metro Station and is right opposite the Kingdom of Dreams .\nThe Leisure Valley Park is a pleasant green area surrounded by the city's concrete jungle.\nThis Park is quite popular amongst kids, youngsters and the locals.\nIt's open for the public from 5 AM in the morning to 9 PM in the evening, everyday. Outside the park, and near the entrance, several illegal kiosks have come up, selling eatables.\nThe park, however lacks good maintenance and upkeep. So many stray dogs roam freely inside.",

The entry fee is very reasonable, making it an affordable outing. Be prepared to pay a separate (nominal) fee for bringing your camera.\n\nWe were also fortunate enough to see deer, adding to the overall experience. The paths are well maintained and easy to walk.\n\nTo preserve the sanctuary's natural beauty and ensure the well-being of its inhabitants, please adhere to the following guidelines: no littering, do not feed the birds, maintain silence, and respect wildlife. Keep a safe distance from the animals and avoid approaching them too closely.\n\nOverall, Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary is a wonderful place to connect with nature and observe birds in their natural habitat. It's a must-visit for nature enthusiasts and families alike.",
