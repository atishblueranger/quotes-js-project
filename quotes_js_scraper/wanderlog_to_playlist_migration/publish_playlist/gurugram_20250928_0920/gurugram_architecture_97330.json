It's a prime location for businesses seeking a stylish and well-connected address.\n\nThe first impression is impressive - a modern, well-maintained structure boasting a prime spot on Golf Course Road. Inside, it caters to a professional environment with a focus on convenience.  Several business centers operate within Two Horizon, including WeWork and The Executive Centre, offering flexible office solutions and amenities like meeting rooms and co-working spaces.\n\nWhile there haven't been many reviews mentioning on-site restaurants, the location itself is surrounded by trendy cafes and eateries, making grabbing a bite or entertaining clients a breeze.\n\nThe biggest perk?  Two Horizon seems to excel in both work and commute.  On-site parking is available, and the Sector 42-43 Metro Station is within walking distance. This easy access makes it ideal for professionals who value a good work-life balance.\n\nIt's important to note that Two Horizon caters more towards established businesses or those seeking a premium workspace solution.  Pricing might be on the higher side compared to other office spaces in Gurugram.\n\nOverall, Two Horizon Center is a sleek and well-equipped option for businesses looking for a prestigious address with top-notch facilities and excellent connectivity in the heart of Gurugram's business district.  However, if you're on a tight budget, there might be more affordable options available.",

College and dean dont care about you at all in this pandemic situation. despite repeated requests of giving a short break because of 50% of the batch having covid they cant even postpone the submissions whereas other colleges understand and maintain a better faculty-student relationship and have postponed the submissions. All they care about is the fees in such a bad pandemic situation. Wouldnt recommend at all . Half of the reviews giving 5 stars you see here are by the faculty btw.",
