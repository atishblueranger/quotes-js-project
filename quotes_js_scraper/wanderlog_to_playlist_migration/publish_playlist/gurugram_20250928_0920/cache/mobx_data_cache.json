The entry fee is very reasonable, making it an affordable outing. Be prepared to pay a separate (nominal) fee for bringing your camera.\n\nWe were also fortunate enough to see deer, adding to the overall experience. The paths are well maintained and easy to walk.\n\nTo preserve the sanctuary's natural beauty and ensure the well-being of its inhabitants, please adhere to the following guidelines: no littering, do not feed the birds, maintain silence, and respect wildlife. Keep a safe distance from the animals and avoid approaching them too closely.\n\nOverall, Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary is a wonderful place to connect with nature and observe birds in their natural habitat. It's a must-visit for nature enthusiasts and families alike."

I spotted several migratory birds, including storks, herons, and egrets. The walking trails are clean and well-maintained, with watchtowers that give a great view of the lake and surroundings. It’s a great spot for photography and a quiet getaway from city life. Best time to visit is early morning, especially in the winter months. Highly recommended for nature lovers and families looking for a relaxing day out!"

Just one thing you need to carry binoculars. Without binoculars you can't see them properly. Because they are sitting very far in the water area . You can rent out the binoculars from the ticket counter as well.\nI need to notify  a few things:-\n1- any type of food is not allowed inside the bird park .\n2- no water available inside so carry your water bottle .\n3- carry the Caps or umbrella if you are going in summer / rainy season .\n4- no food cafe There is not inside nor outside the park so carry a few ready to eat snacks .\n\nMinus point - they didn't manage the parks beauty properly. At a few places it looked like a wasteland because of unmanaged trees and grass. They should beautify this amazing place and should start a few activities for kids...so they can enjoy their bird century experience."

The natural beauty of the park provided a stunning backdrop for the event—open skies, fresh air, and just enough greenery to make the whole experience feel surreal.\n\nThe sound system was top-notch, delivering deep bass and crisp highs that carried beautifully through the open space. The lighting setup was equally impressive, with lasers, strobes, and ambient visuals that perfectly matched the vibe of the music. The DJs kept the crowd moving all night with a well-curated mix of tracks that ranged from melodic to downright intense.\n\nOne thing that stood out was how well-organized everything was. Entry was smooth, there were plenty of food and drink stalls, and the security team did a great job of keeping things safe without being overbearing. The crowd was diverse and friendly, and the overall atmosphere felt inclusive and welcoming.\n\nDancing under the stars to some of the best techno music I’ve heard live was an unforgettable experience. Everyone seemed to be in high spirits, and you could feel the shared appreciation for music and connection.\n\nLasser Valley Park proved to be an ideal venue for a concert of this scale. I genuinely hope this becomes a recurring event because it set a new standard for outdoor music festivals. Hats off to the organizers for pulling off such a fantastic night."

It is an urban park offering a rose garden, picnic spots, a cafe and a fountain with musical water shows.\nThere is no entry fee to Leisure Valley Park . A musical fountain is operated in the evenings. It is at a short walking distance from the IFFCO Chowk Metro Station and is right opposite the Kingdom of Dreams .\nThe Leisure Valley Park is a pleasant green area surrounded by the city’s concrete jungle.\nThis Park is quite popular amongst kids, youngsters and the locals.\nIt’s open for the public from 5 AM in the morning to 9 PM in the evening, everyday. Outside the park, and near the entrance, several illegal kiosks have come up, selling eatables.\nThe park, however lacks good maintenance and upkeep. So many stray dogs roam freely inside."

We spent the whole day exploring the landscapes, watching the trains glide through tunnels and bridges, and enjoying the interactive exhibits. The staff was friendly, and the kids loved learning about how everything worked. It’s a perfect mix of creativity, craftsmanship, and fun!

At ₹750 per person, it's a bit on the expensive side, but the attention to detail and creativity in the miniature landscapes make it a worthwhile visit. Spending a few hours here is a delightful experience, and it's perfect for those looking for a unique and peaceful getaway. The owner’s passion and knowledge add to the overall enjoyment. While it's a bit pricey, the memories you'll create, and the joy of your inner child coming to life, make it a worthwhile visit for anyone seeking a smaller-scale adventure."

The place is relatively small but the collection is huge and more importantly, the items on display are rare, collected by no one else. Salute also to the Aryan family who are upholding the Indian folk art at personal expense.\nThe people I met at the museum were courteous and gentle and decent people. Visit is by prior appointment.

It's a typical Bunglow until you enter inside to find out that a whole different world is waiting for people unexplored by masses. The place is maintained and owned by Aryan family. The collection is entirely of Mr. K.C. Aryan, one of the most prominent historians of India. There are various idols, sculptures, paintings, artefacts, stones, ancient items, etc. Director of the place, Mr. B.N Aryan is a very intelligent and knowledgeable person he along with his sister Ms. Subhashini Aryan (Sorry If I'm wrong) guides people who comes to visit this museum. They personally met me and guided me around showing every artefact and telling about it in details I almost felt as if I'm actually witnessing the history connected to those things. I hope this place prevails in the future and all this cultural inheritance of India which is often neglected would remain safe and open for scholars, researchers and students. I recommend you to make a prior appointment before coming to avoid unnecessary hustle. Would love to visit again. Thank you for such an amazing tour of history."

The local people fo not even know that the place exists, so I got no help from them. There was a guard who told us to wait for 5 minutes for the owner, but they never appeared. If a human puts in time and effort to find this place they should atleast respect it and see us. We waited outside for 30 minutes. I was with an elderly person, for thwm to stand and wait for 30 minutes in the scorching heat of gurgaon summers is hard. Another important thing is that they have not put their timings properly on google. They also expect you to make appointments to visit, it is only open for all on sundays. The fact that they ask you to make appointments is not mentioned on google. Thats rude of you all.\nthe photos of this place also seem fake. They dont have a field or anything. It is an brick bungalow.This was a waste of time and money. I hope you see this review before trying to visit this place."

It's on the 3rd floor and the beer tastes good.\nThe only thing which I would like to highlight is the service. As I was the only one present at that time still they took around half an hour for 1 quick bite i.e. crispy fries."

The management's lack of customer friendliness was evident throughout my visit. One of the major letdowns was the minuscule portions of food we were served. The quantity was shockingly insufficient, leaving us unsatisfied and hungry. It felt like they were more concerned with cutting costs rather than providing a satisfactory dining experience.\n\nMoreover, the ambience on weekdays was far from pleasant. Instead of a cozy and inviting atmosphere, it resembled a noisy bar with blaring music. The excessive noise made it difficult to have a conversation or enjoy a relaxing evening. The overall vibe of the place was disappointing and did not match the expectations set by its name.\n\nAll in all, my experience at The Whisky Bar & Brewpub was average at best. I would not recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable dining experience. The subpar management, small food portions, and unpleasant ambience make it fall short of the mark. It's unfortunate to witness such a lack of attention to detail and customer satisfaction."

Wouldn't even consider it (no one knows why)\n\nAnd the music, the DJ must have taken your favourite tracks over the last ten years and mixed it with the worst possible post apocalyptic EDM. Can't express just how bad the music was.\n\nComing to measures taken against the pandemic. Only one person in the entire staff could be spotted wearing a mask. There was no social distancing done between tables even though the place was half empty.\n\nMaybe this is how it is on a Monday evening but it was enough to ruin the experience"

The pub had very limited options for both drinks and food, despite claiming at the time of booking that they had everything available. There was no premium whiskey, and the food choices were sparse—only 2-3 vegetarian options and a couple of standard non-veg dishes. The service was also subpar, with just one person serving all the tables, leading to long wait times just to place an order. I wouldn’t recommend this place, and I certainly won’t be returning."

Anyways, I attended a wedding, so I'll limit my feedback to that.\n\nThe approach is a bit tricky from the main road. You can see the building, but who's gonna tell a newcomer where the entrance is? Why can't you guys put up a board which shows where the entrance to the place is? So you figure out on your own by entering the residential area, and suddenly there's an entrance to the left.\n\nThe staff manning the food stalls were OK.\n\nThe food itself was mediocre but palatable, though I've had much better food at lesser known places.\n\nNot a single dustbin in the portico & parking area? If someone wants to dump a napkin, cigarette or any trash, where would one do that? At the reception?\n\nAll in all, as a wedding guest, my experience was less than average. The management needs to pull up their socks on some points, especially now as it's the wedding season."

The ticket price for aged people and kids below 4 feet are considerably low. Even the costumes here are available for cash purchase only, you can't get them on rent as compared to other water parks, that constituted quite a big drawback. Even the staff was not that cooperative. They said that we've to buy the costume without even trying. When I found one of our uncomfortable, I get back to them for change and was ready to pay the extra amount of other costume, they refused to change it and I had to talk to manager for that. Food was also quite expensive. The small plate of rajma rice was for RS 200 which one person can eat very easily. So if you'd be going with family it'll not cost you less than 1k for food only. This place is good for one time visit but it'd say that it was not worth money. Rather than going here you should visit WORLD OF WONDER water park and whose tickets are also cheap. In their super save pack you can get both amusement park and water park tickets for only 1100."

It was established in 1984 to commemorate the 1982 Asian Games, inaugurated on 19 November 1984 by the then Prime Minister of India, Shri Rajiv Gandhi.

However there is one drawback since it is surrounded by residents flats hence they stop music sharp at 10 PM which is not good as you know specially in these metropolitan cities where people starts coming by 8 or 8:30 and suddenly you came to know that they will stop music by 10 which is not good .rest ambience is good and location wise also it has advantage since it is on shona road which is not crowded.  Ample space for parking tennis court are inside the premises which is good. Pool is also clean however it in medium size good for parties where guests are limited . Decoration are okay okay type . Staffs specially seniors are rude and not supportive who are ready to listen your request."

The journey through Tikli village can be a bit challenging, but the destination is well worth it.\n\nWe visited for an office team day outing a couple of years back in December, which included a delightful continental lunch buffet served by the pool. The spread was impressive, with a variety of flavorful dishes. The setting by the pool only enhanced the experience, making it both relaxing and luxurious.\n\nRun by a foreign national, the property exudes a unique charm, blending international hospitality with local warmth. The house staff were exceptional—warm, attentive, and incredibly sweet. Their cocktail-making skills deserve a special mention; each drink was crafted to perfection, adding a fun twist to our day.\n\nOverall, this place is a perfect blend of natural beauty, great food, and warm hospitality. If you're looking for a quick getaway from Gurgaon, this Aravali retreat is a must-visit! Just be prepared for a slightly tricky drive to reach this slice of paradise."

Lunch provided was good.\nOne thing you should be ready for is:\nThe owner is quite rude and arrogant. He’s not from India, and he’ll show this in every conversation. For instance, when I gave the final payment in cash to him in evening, I asked him, would you like to count? His reply was, “unlike you Indians I trust people”. I was like, he could have answered a simple NO. Owner’s wife was better spoken."

The event was well-organized, with games during the day and live music, DJ, and dancing at night. The property is lush green, spacious, and very well-maintained, perfect for a big gathering.\n\nThe owner was extremely helpful and ensured we had everything we needed, including a large speaker and mic. The staff was available 24/7, making the experience smooth and hassle-free. Though the last 2 km stretch is a bit rocky, the beautiful ambiance of the property made it all worth it.\n\nPros:\n- Lush green and well-maintained property.\n- Huge lawn, ideal for large gatherings.\n- Helpful owner and 24/7 staff support.\n- Provided speaker and mic for events.\n\nCons:\n- The last 2 km stretch to the property is rocky.\n\nOverall, it’s a great choice for corporate events or any big occasion! Highly recommend it."

He behaved as if we were asking for free food, while it is our due right to taste the food so as to avoid any unpleasant experiences during the party.\nWhile we only had a small gathering of 40 people, we were forced by Mr. Minty, Head Manager, to pay for 50 pax and not even allowed to pack the food for some of our guests who left in hurry without eating or those who couldn’t eat properly as they were busy managing the guests.\nQuite disappointing and such rigid behaviour need to be corrected and noted by the staff for long continuance of business/services."

Your parking spot to the entrance to the DLF building, will be at least 500 m distance. It might not sound a lot, but these 500m will melt you in this scorching heat.\nMoreover, the guards and the SGV receptionist are unbelievably rude.\nHad my parents with me (60 and 61), asked them to let me drop them and spare them the walk in this heatwave. But the authoritative idiots didn't even listen to us, let alone accommodate us.\nGave this feedback to Mr. Rajesh from the admin team, although in vain. It happened the next time again."

              "reviewText": "Two Horizon Center in Gurugram isn't your typical office building. It's a prime location for businesses seeking a stylish and well-connected address.\n\nThe first impression is impressive - a modern, well-maintained structure boasting a prime spot on Golf Course Road. Inside, it caters to a professional environment with a focus on convenience.  Several business centers operate within Two Horizon, including WeWork and The Executive Centre, offering flexible office solutions and amenities like meeting rooms and co-working spaces.\n\nWhile there haven't been many reviews mentioning on-site restaurants, the location itself is surrounded by trendy cafes and eateries, making grabbing a bite or entertaining clients a breeze.\n\nThe biggest perk?  Two Horizon seems to excel in both work and commute.  On-site parking is available, and the Sector 42-43 Metro Station is within walking distance. This easy access makes it ideal for professionals who value a good work-life balance.\n\nIt's important to note that Two Horizon caters more towards established businesses or those seeking a premium workspace solution.  Pricing might be on the higher side compared to other office spaces in Gurugram.\n\nOverall, Two Horizon Center is a sleek and well-equipped option for businesses looking for a prestigious address with top-notch facilities and excellent connectivity in the heart of Gurugram's business district.  However, if you're on a tight budget, there might be more affordable options available."

There are several advantages (1.) away from the humdrum of other Gurgaon colonies located within easy access from the highway with a green patch so no noises of traffic heard (2.) most of them are upper middle class gentry. It’s a friendly and close knit colony (3.) no surface parking of cars and all cars are parked underground hence no car is seen outside which is a big plus (4.) it’s a green and clean colony and dog friendly (5.) all facilities including grocery shop, vegetables and even saloon attached to the colony (6.) all facilities like badminton, long tennis, swimming pool, indoor games available. (7.) safe and secure colony located in a good area. The surrounding sector 31 is an up keep area. The security in the colony of course is very good but the security in sector 31 is also good providing a good secure location. (8.) no other high-rises in the vicinity and only residential homes are located. As a result is an open space with very good breeze and ventilation"

The quality of the crowd has significantly dropped too. Now, this whole place is full of mobile phone repair stores and not much else. My advice? Give this place a wide berth if you want to do any actual shopping and are looking to get your money's worth. And also if you're looking for a nice restaurant or cafe. There are much better places to go to in Gurugram."

Found here some of those niche stores like : Nicobar, Ellementry Home to the Big Chill Cakery to Lo’opera , Barista, Khan Chacha, Le Marche and many more outlets, this place is a must visit for everyone.\nMy Find here was the “CRUDO JUICERY” a quite little place tucked in the far end is a special place for all those quiet admirers of healthy haven with their ohh so delicious juices menu and the latest addition of their Sattu, jaggery, til and seeds laddoos. I tried the Crudo delight which was extremely tasty. A must try for freshness favourite people.\nThank you."

The security facilities are good but not too heavy. Awesome architecture design...a marvel of modern engineering. This is a really beautiful constructed business park in Gurugram.\nIt has 12 floors and you can see gurgaon from the top floors. Highly recommended for those who are searching for an office (rent Or lease or even buying) in gurgaon.\nYou can reach it through the HUDA City Centre metro station. If you want to take sharing auto, then take it till Subhash Chowk, and from there it’s a 10 minutes walk down the straight road. Sharing-auto system is very popular especially amongst the daily-commuters who visit their offices from cities such as Haryana, Delhi, Noida, Faridabad, etc.\nYou can find eating joints and stalls at the front and back-side of the building. A great place to work with a professional environment and good networking opportunities. Much recommended for work!!\nBut water logging is horrible in monsoon."

College and dean dont care about you at all in this pandemic situation. despite repeated requests of giving a short break because of 50% of the batch having covid they cant even postpone the submissions whereas other colleges understand and maintain a better faculty-student relationship and have postponed the submissions. All they care about is the fees in such a bad pandemic situation. Wouldnt recommend at all . Half of the reviews giving 5 stars you see here are by the faculty btw."

Mr. Vaibhav Kulshreshtha, is the principal/ founder of this Firm and he is very ethical in his dealing. What I liked in his is his transparency with the client in respect to the choices and suggestion. He is very blunt with his views, which in fact is a boon for the client. The staff of the firm is very supportive and take pain in addressing even the minutest query of the client. While I was taking services of Shilpshala for construction and designing of my office, there were times when I called Mr. Vaibhav at odd hours in respect to my query, and every time, Mr. Vaibhav answered the call and addressed my queries. He doesn't have any air or arrogance and is very warm. I highly recommend Shilpshala."
