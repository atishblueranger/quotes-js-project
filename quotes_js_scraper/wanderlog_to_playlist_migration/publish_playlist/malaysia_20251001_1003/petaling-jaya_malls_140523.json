The mall itself is clean, modern, and generally has a nice environment with friendly staff and a good crowd. However, there are a few things I noticed that I think really need improvement.\n\nFirst of all, I was surprised to see that there isn't a supermarket or grocery store inside the mall. For a place in such a prime location with so many visitors, it's honestly disappointing. Many people – including tourists, families, and locals – often look for a place to grab essentials or do quick grocery shopping after dining or walking around. Not having that option makes the mall feel incomplete.\n\nAnother thing is the baby room. While I appreciate that there is one, it's really small and doesn't have hot or warm water, which is important for families with babies. If you're a parent and need to prepare milk or clean up, it's not very convenient. I really hope they consider upgrading this facility to better support family visitors.\n\nI like this mall and see its potential, but these small things make a big difference. A grocery store and better family-friendly facilities would make the mall much more useful and complete for everyday needs.",

One of the first things I appreciated was the variety of shops. Ranging from international brands to local favorites, which gave me plenty of options for both shopping and browsing. The food court was another highlight, offering a mix of Japanese, Asian, and Western cuisine. It was clean, well-organized, and had enough seating even during peak hours. I especially liked the presence of some niche eateries that are hard to find in other malls. What stood out to me the most was the attention to design and atmosphere. The interiors were aesthetically pleasing and there was a calm, relaxed vibe throughout. It didn't feel overly commercial or rushed, which made the experience more pleasant. I also noticed that the facilities were well-maintained. Restrooms were clean and there were plenty of places to rest or wait comfortably.",

But now, only the one on Level 1 remains-and it's not very big either. It gets extremely crowded on weekends.\n\nPlease consider bringing back more free play areas. They really encourage families with children, like mine, to shop and dine at your mall. In fact, the free play areas were the main reason we decided to visit in the first place.",

Sadly, in our opinion, this shopping mall has aged a lot since, and the shops therein looked \"tired and weary\" - except maybe the Don Don Donki outlet and the H&M outlet. We were also quite disappointed that there is a 50 Sen charge for using the public toilets here. For us, the only place worth visiting here is Hutong 10 - our favourite food court in KL.",

It is very hard to find street paid parking. Therefore, the cheapest and most convenient option is to park inside the starling mall. However, it is a bit tricky to find the entrance into the mall parking. You have to circle the building a bit and try to search for the word uptown7. I drove very slowly and went up the ram into the mall parking on the first floor. If you opt to park at the premier parking lot then you have to fork out extra money which from my inspection is RM4 for the first hour. This is because you only have to walk a bit to the mall entrance compared to the normal parking lots that need to walk a wee bit from the mall entrance but it is way cheaper. For the weekend and public holiday  normal parking lot rate is the first two hours is RM1 and then third and fourth hour is RM1 per hour and subsequently hour is RM2 per hour. The mall is more like specializing in eateries. The mall is the heaven for food hunters. Lots of nice restaurants and even their food court is full of diners and delicious foods!!! Definitely worth to pay a visit to the mall. The mall also has an event hall at level 5 that constantly has warehouse sales. For this weekend, there are Rohto Mentholatum sales. Most of the items were up to 80% discounted and the expiry date is about 1.5 years later. Therefore, it is still consider a good deal if you have a fans of skincare. Would definitely will visit this mall again in future. The only problem is the traffic outside the mall is horrendous.",

We noticed what looked like a gaming tournament or e-sports event happening while we were there, which might be exciting if you're into that scene.\n\nThat said, it wasn't really our style of shopping – quite busy, a bit older in feel, and more geared toward niche hobbies or bargain hunting than mainstream retail.\n\n✅ Worth checking out if you're into gaming, cosplay, or retro gadgets – otherwise, there are more modern malls nearby like Pavilion or Lot 10.\n\n📍Good central location in Bukit Bintang, with easy access from the monorail.",

You might end up in KL instead if you're not guided by Waze / Grab car / signage🥴\n\nThis is definitely a shopping 'stop' for the rich / T20 class. Unlike the regular malls around PJ & KL, you won't find the usual shopping atmosphere nor brands as the tenants within are very exclusive and tailored for the high net worth shoppers. From grocery to F&B, jewelry and even clothing, each outlet is exquisitely designed and housed in a personalized space where only the average shopper can feast their eyes or perhaps window shop merely for leisure. Every floor is unique and not the same, somewhat like traveling in a maze with shops positioned in unimaginable corners / space.🧐 Do refer to my photos attached for illustration.\n\nWell BSC has upscaled so much over time that you might just consider coming here every now and then or ocassionaly under invitation for a formal event.😂",

However, there are some exceptions that make the experience a bit daunting.\n\nIssues with the parents room include:\n\n1. The changing mat: I don't get why they use changing mats that can't be cleaned effectively which leaves previous baby poop and other stains all over them. There have been ants all over the changing station as a result of poor cleaning frequency. Also? I don't know how frequently this is cleaned through out the day. It's better to just lift the whole mat off and use your own but this is a problem if you didn't come equipped with a changing mat.\n\n2. The breastfeeding room doors- for the longest time this one door has not been repaired. I don't understand why it's so difficult to just fix the door and the locking mechanism.\n\n3. Temperature- when you go in the breastfeeding room and you are trying to nurse a very hungry baby, your body starts to sweat when you are seated like that for up to 40mins. Baby is also turning red from heat and constantly close against mommy. The air conditioner never works. Bring your own portable fan, since they clearly have no interest to fix this issue.\n\n4. Shoes- are all patrons of parents room supposed to take off shoes or only for the play area? They used to have a list of rules on the wall prior to renovations ( when it was a “mothers” only room). Now there's no clear indication of the rule regarding shoes.\n\nPerks to the parents room:\n\n1. Hot and cold water dispenser\n\n2. Clean toilet for parent and child\n\n3. Play area for older children with various toys\n\n4. Bright lighting and nice interior designs",

During my visit on a Monday afternoon, the mall was relatively quiet, which made for a pleasant and relaxed experience. Parking was hassle-free, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that the first three hours were free-a definite plus.\n\nThe mall features a good selection of F&B outlets, especially on the ground floor, while the other floors house a mix of retail stores with a familiar setup. While exploring, I noticed several stores offering clearance sales, with some moving out. Despite discounts of up to 80%, I found the prices still not quite justifiable, particularly for their dresses. Additionally, there were quite a few vacant shop lots, though the overall mall environment managed to conceal this well.\n\nI had lunch at Roberto's, which was a nice experience, and overall, I enjoyed my visit. While the mall is still developing, I see potential for it to thrive in the near future, especially if more businesses set up shop. It's a promising place for those who prefer a quieter shopping experience without overwhelming crowds.",

That sparked an idea - I'll definitely try recreating the dish at home!\n\nBefore heading back to JB, we also picked up some fresh-cut fruits for the road. Overall, a convenient and satisfying stop.

I had complete peace of mind throughout the flight, and even my 7-year-old child could participate with full confidence.\n\nBefore the flight, there was a detailed briefing where the instructor explained hand signals to communicate different movements, as the wind can be too strong to hear instructions clearly.\n\nThere are different flight options available, including standard low-altitude flying and high-altitude flying with the instructor. You can check with the counter to see which package best suits you. The staff were very friendly and never pressured us into choosing the more expensive options.\n\nHowever, please note that this activity may not be suitable for individuals with heart conditions. Personally, I felt a little dizzy after spinning multiple times, so it's something to keep in mind.\n\nOverall, I was extremely satisfied with the instructor's guidance. The entire experience was well-organized, and professional cameras captured every moment. If you like the footage, you can purchase it afterward. Highly recommended!",
