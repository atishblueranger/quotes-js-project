I have more time to select what I want to buy without disturbance.\nDuring my visit here, I bought a box of Hair Color Conditioner with Natural Herbs to darken gray hair 😄. Many types of hair color I've tried but this one is really effective 👍. I bought it from Guardian.\nEarlier I told the sales girl that I need hair color that can cover gray hair so she recommended me \"BIGEN\".\n\nIn this mall, many other businesses operates here. And while waiting for my daughters, I went down to 1st floor and walked around. I stopped by to order chicken floss cheese wafer and a cup of corn cheese and seated on a bench near a Cafe.\n\nStar City Mall provides many benches for customers to take rest after hours of shopping. It makes this place more convenient and suitable for everyone.\nAnything you can find here, boutiques, saloon, Digi Shop, Watson, Guardian, Bata, Sundry Shops, Food Court, Secret Recipe, KFC and many more shops.\n\nENJOY YOUR TIME DURING SEASON HOLIDAYS 😍😍😍.",

            "text": "⭐️⭐️⭐️ (3/5)\n\nA Mixed Bag of Convenience and Nostalgia\n\nStar City Mall has been around for quite some time, and it definitely carries that feeling of nostalgia for those of us who grew up seeing it evolve. Located in a fairly accessible area of Kota Kinabalu, it's not the flashiest or most modern mall in town, but it still offers a certain charm and serves its purpose for quick errands or casual visits.\n\nThe mall is relatively small compared to newer shopping centers, but it's straightforward to navigate. There's a decent mix of shops-ranging from small local businesses to mobile shops, salons, and some clothing stores. You can also find a supermarket inside, which is convenient if you live nearby and need to grab groceries without battling heavy crowds.\n\nOne of the best things about Star City is that it's usually not overcrowded, which makes it a peaceful spot to take a break. There are a few food and beverage outlets, although not many big-name brands. If you're not fussy and just need a place to relax and grab a bite, it does the job.\n\nThat said, the mall could use a facelift. Some areas look outdated and under-maintained, and a few units remain empty. Parking is generally easy, although the area can feel a bit quiet in the evenings.\n\nOverall, Star City Mall is more of a neighborhood convenience spot than a shopping destination. It's great for quick visits, simple needs, and a dose of old-school KK vibes. Just don't expect anything fancy.",

Set within the exclusive Kota Kinabalu City Waterfront (KKCW) development at the heart of the city, Oceanus Waterfront Mall is one of the city's trendiest urban lifestyle hotspots with a diverse range of shopping, dining, entertainment and leisure activities that guarantees something for everyone. Indulge in some of Kota Kinabalu's mouth-watering food and delight in its finest fashion as you explore the mall. At the end of the day, sit back, relax and take in the sight of the best sunset view the city has to offer right at our doorstep!\n\nWith ample parking spaces as well as convenient pick-up and drop off zones, Oceanus Waterfront Mall is easily accessible to tourists and locals alike! As you step into the mall, you are transported into a shopping haven that promises a marine experience. True to its name, the mall is tastefully decorated with the ocean in mind. While there, shoppers will have the opportunity to view the tallest hand-cut mosaic pillars in Malaysia, with each one featuring a marine animal that finds its home in Sabah waters.\n\nThe mall also caters to numerous events that guarantees a fun and memorable time for the family. With a great shopping experience, fun events and delectable dining, Oceanus Waterfront Mall is sure the place to be!\n\nIt all started with an idea to create an artwork that is awe-inspiring and at the same time portray a message that resonates with both locals and tourists alike. The artwork should embody the spirit of the Oceanus Waterfront Mall. It should hold great significance and it should be iconic.\n\nIconic it was. What resulted from a mere idea was the creation of four multi coloured hand-cut mosaic columns, known as the “Pillars of the Sea”. Each column is approximately 18.5 meters in height and spans four floors, from the floor of the concourse level to the ceiling of the second floor. The towering height of these columns earned it the title as “The Tallest Hand-Cut Mosaic Columns in Malaysia” by the Malaysian Book of Records.\n\nThe monumental task of building the Pillars of Colour was given to Penang-based Company, Sculpture At Work – the only UNESCO award winning company in the country to have done similar kinds of hand-cut mosaic projects. However, while the company has worked with pieces on flat surfaces, this is the first time it had dealt with a curved surface. The creation of the columns took 1 year from the conception of its idea to the piecing together of every cut mosaic tile on the pillar. The images were first drawn and then computer generated. Once done, the team had to mould and cast the pillars before attempting to stick on the hand-cut mosaic tiles piece by piece.\n\nEvery piece of mosaic tiles were well thought-out and positioned. When looked at as a whole, observers will notice that certain pieces of mosaic tiles are gleaming. This is deliberately placed in order to create a 3D effect of movement. It is to simulate the movement of the sea creatures underwater.\n\nEach column depicts one sea creature that finds its home in our waters – the dolphin, the turtle, the jellyfish and the stingray. The depiction of these sea creatures serve to create awareness about the problems our marine life are facing due to man-made problems of pollution, overfishing and illegal poaching.\n\nThe creation of these larger-than-life images serve to remind us that our waters are home to some of the most fascinating creatures in the world, and while we are lucky to see it in our lifetimes, it may not be the case for the generations to come if we do not continue our efforts to safeguard them.\n\nThe Pillars of the Sea are the pride of the Oceanus Waterfront Mall and the pride of the people of Sabah. They are iconic pillars that will be admired for many years to come!",
