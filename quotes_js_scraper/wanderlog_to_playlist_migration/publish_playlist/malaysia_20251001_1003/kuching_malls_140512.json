While not as massive as The Spring, VivaCity covers all the basics with a good mix of international brands, local boutiques, and entertainment options.\n\nThe food court is a major draw - try the Sarawak laksa at the heritage food section or grab bubble tea from popular chains. The cinema offers comfortable seating with reasonable ticket prices, making it a favorite local hangout spot. Family-friendly features like the indoor playground and arcade keep kids entertained for hours.\n\nParking is plentiful (and free!), a rare perk in urban Kuching. The layout feels spacious and never too crowded, even on weekends. Look out for seasonal decorations and events that really liven up the central atrium.\n\nSome stores feel a bit repetitive, and the luxury brand selection can't compete with downtown malls. But for everyday shopping needs or a casual day out, VivaCity hits the mark. The attached hotel adds convenience for visitors.\n\nRating: 4/5 - A dependable suburban mall that's worth the short drive from the city center. Not groundbreaking, but reliably good for what it offers.\n\nPro tip: Visit during weekday afternoons for the most relaxed experience. Don't miss the night market (pasar malam) in the parking lot area on select evenings for awesome local street food!",

The parking space is spacious, and when you enter, they scan your car's ID-so when you leave, the gate just opens up automatically. Love the techy smooth flow~\n\nInside, it's clean with a chill atmosphere. They've got tons of promos if you're a member (wish I had one, cryin' in non-member 😭). But here's the catch: you will need to queue at the cashier... and I'm not kidding, even at 00.00 there can still be a line -like, this place really be the hangout spot for midnight grocery runs.\n\nPrices are actually on the cheaper side, and they sell everything-groceries, produce, frozen goods, snacks, you name it.

The dim lighting, cracked floor tiles, and musty corridors scream 1990s nostalgia rather than modern retail comfort.\n\nWhat keeps it alive:\n- A stubborn cluster of phone repair shops that can resurrect any damaged device\n- Bargain-bin priced accessories (cases, chargers, cables) you won't find in glitzier malls\n- The occasional tech whiz who can source obscure electronic components\n\nThe food court on the upper level serves basic local fare - edible if you're desperate, but not worth a special trip. Prepare for questionable hygiene standards and aggressive aircon spots alternating with sweatbox zones.\n\nWeekdays feel like wandering through an abandoned tech bazaar, while weekends bring slight energy from bargain hunters. Don't expect English signage or tourist-friendly amenities.\n\nRating: 2/5 - Only worth enduring for two reasons:\n1) You need a phone fixed cheaply\n2) You're a urban explorer documenting dying Malaysian retail spaces",

There are gardening supplies, furniture, household items, plumbing, power tools, toiletries and more. Their furniture selection has more variety and competitive prices compared to Emart. The air cond reduces in strength at the upper floors. A few cons are not enough food courts. There is a Mr DIY and a clothing store. Ample parking space. Good place for people looking to bulk buy, DIY their houses or set up a catering business.",
