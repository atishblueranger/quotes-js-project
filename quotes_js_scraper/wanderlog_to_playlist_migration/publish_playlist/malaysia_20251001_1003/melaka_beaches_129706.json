You might see some wild animals like jungle cats and monkeys 🐒-just be careful and please don't feed them. Don't worry, they won't disturb you if you don't disturb them.\n\nA lot of people come here for jogging and walking, but when I arrived around 2 PM, it was still quiet. Usually, the crowd comes in from 4 PM to 7 PM 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️. There's plenty of parking space 🚗 and it's not far from the entrance.\n\nI came here in the afternoon riding an electric bicycle 🚴‍♀️-so nice and cooling! The whole track is covered with tall trees 🌲 so it's shady and cool, perfect for jogging or cycling. Just take note, the path is a bit hilly, so if you're on a bike, keep your brakes ready at all times ⚠️.\n\nAt the entrance, there's a small café ☕-great for relaxing or ‘healing' after your walk. At first, it may look like there's not much to see, but once you go further in, you'll find gardens, clean toilets 🚻, and some fun animal replicas 🦁🐘. Each trail also has clear direction signs to help guide you 🧭.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my time here. It's such a peaceful and beautiful place to exercise and unwind. Highly recommended for nature lovers! 🌿💚",

Just keep your eyes open - they blend in well! A quick tip: don't get too close to the monkeys or stare into their eyes - they can get a bit aggressive.\n\nIt's also a great spot for a picnic or just a quiet walk in nature. However, the place felt a bit abandoned or perhaps under maintenance when we visited - several areas were closed off, which was disappointing.\n\nStill, overall a great nature experience for those looking to disconnect and enjoy some greenery.",
