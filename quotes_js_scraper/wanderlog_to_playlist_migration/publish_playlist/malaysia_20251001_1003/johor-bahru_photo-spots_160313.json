No rush feeling and dont have to prepare in advance as make up, hair style and clothes are all prepared there evej man clothes. Very surprised they even have clothes that fit pregnant mummy. The staff and make up artist are very helpful. Even we are very new to selfie studio, they patient helped us and very friendly. Also patient towards my son, who is abit impatient during the process. I would say this service us very suitable for family especially with kids, so can take pic comfortably and rest in between. Can also see the result on screen so we know it is nice or not 🤣. Price also very reasonable because the result is super nice and make up also very professional, makes me look alot younger 🤭",

Visited during Sunday morning and it hasn open yet for public iktikaf. Some muslimah corner inside mosque isn't carpeted and is not air conditioned but we'll understand due to open air flow and giant fans provided, but i do expect better as it is linked to royal's mosque nevertheless the ablution and ladies room are well maintained and fully equipped.\n\nAnother low barred high expectation drop as the muslimah section was only separated by a wooden carved divider from the muslim section. Was expecting a better muslimah prayer corner or it could be they closed section on the day i visited. Anyways, kudos to both security guards as i feel like both of em being attentive towards non-stop visiting jemaahs that day.",

Right at the entrance (Zone 1), you're welcomed by parrots and cockatoos you can actually touch and take selfies with!They even had snakes here too. This was a major highlight and a unique, memorable experience.\nDespite its smaller size, we saw a satisfying range including elephants, chimpanzees, lions, tigers, the unique Malay tapir, camels, hippos, monkeys, and various birds spread across the zones",

            "text": "It was an unplanned visit to Zoo Johor during last weekend which turned up to be an incredible family trip for my 1y daughter.\n\n1) TICKET\nI just bought up the ticket via their official website the night before. And guess what, the website is exceptionally convenient. I finished my booking just within 5 minutes. It cost RM10/adult, RM30/foreigner and free for infant <2y. The idea of QR code is also obviously easier and faster access. As the cost given, they are very strict to see your honesty and will ask for your identification card & passport prior entrance. Don't forget to bring yours!☝🏻\n\n2) THE ANIMAL EXPERIENCES\nIt is a compact but still a fun to visit zoo! Most might say the zoo is small compared to other zoo. Yes, I will not denied it. But maybe because of the age (not so old 😌), it makes the journey shorter & less tiring even under the scorching sun AND carrying your 1y+ daughter all along. Even though they have less variation of animals, kids always happy whenever they watch animals. Hippopotamus is my fav one.🦛 Sadly, there was no giraffe at that time. Sometime, they have elephant show too. We managed to catch a memory with the birds.\n\n3) THE TRAIL\nIt's a 50-50 stroller friendly. 50% of the trail are accessible by stroller/tricycle especially the first trail over your right when you enter. Meanwhile, the other 50% will be a challenge to all parents as we need to climb the stairs, mainly over the tiger,lion,bear area. No tips. Just endure it!🙈\n\n4) FOOD\nYeah, the zoo is friendly to outside food! Inside the zoo, only vending machines available. Along the parking area, they provide foodtrucks too. Buckle up some food and water from home if you want to save up. After strolling, you can shade under a 'picnic' area beside the playground and enjoy your food.\n\n5) PARKING\nVery limited along the main road area. It depends on your luck. However, there is a free shuttle bus provided from Kota Jail's parking (if I'm not mistaken). Sorry, I have limited info since I managed to get a parking along the road.🤭\n\nHave a pleasant experience in Zoo Johor!",

It's a place where you can rub shoulders with locals, observe their daily routines, and experience the authentic heart of Johor Bahru.  The prices are generally reasonable, and bargaining is often expected and encouraged, adding another layer of engaging interaction to the shopping experience.\n\nHowever, be prepared for a sensory overload.  The sights, sounds, and smells can be intense, and the narrow walkways can feel cramped at peak times.  Navigating the market requires patience and a willingness to embrace the lively chaos.\n\nOverall, Johor Street Market is a must-visit for anyone seeking an authentic and immersive cultural experience. It's a place where you can discover unique treasures, savor delicious street food, and soak up the vibrant energy of a truly unforgettable marketplace.  Just remember to wear comfortable shoes and embrace the adventure!",

With high glass wall panel that protects you from feeling falling over and high winds, you can safely overcome those fears and at least once in your life gather those guts to walk those glass floors. Just dont look down, if you must, then take a peek. Like me. That said, online booking must be made first in advance.

Staff asked why do I want to refund and i said because it's been 50 minutes and he rudely asked me if i am able to see that he is alone. I told him that he didn't need to be so rude. I just wanted a refund since it looks like he has stacks of orders before making my order. On top of that he kept on taking new orders. I took his picture to inform owner of this wild behaviour but was given the middle finger. And still refused to refund me. Hope the owner can respond to my DM on instagram. I understand that he was alone but he said to wait “sekejap (for a bit)” after we made our purchase, not beforehand. 50 minutes is not “sekejap”. Plus i nicely asked to cancel. Maybe he was stressed but the response was really unnecessary. Please train your staff or better yet replace that staff. That staff gone case dah. Cuba ambil yang beradap sikit.",
