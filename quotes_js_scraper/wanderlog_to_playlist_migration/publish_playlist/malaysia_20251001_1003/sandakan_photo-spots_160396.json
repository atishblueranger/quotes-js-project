It is a very well maintained park, litter free. Nature treks and paved walkways available. I managed to see 3 rhinoceros hornbill and some monkeys :) Also found sepilok giant tree and kalibi monster tree (25m) with a bit of help from other park visitors. I was there from 830-12noon. Park was not crowded, I saw less than 10 other park visitors during my time there. And had the suspension bridge all to myself for 15 mins. Highly recommended if you go to sepilok. The bird watching towers have amazing views. I learnt that white is an alarm color for birds (and bright florescent colors). PS: I wasn't bitten by any mosquitos (shorts, no insect repellent)",

The church was partially destroyed during WWII and was rebuilt after the war.\nThe exterior is constructed with rugged stone walls and pointed arches. The roof is steeply pitched and covered with slate roof tiles.\nThe windows on both ends of the hall are adorned with intricate stained-glass designs, depicting biblical scenes and saints.\nAs I step inside, immediately noticed the cool, slightly musty scent of aged stone and wood. The interior is spacious and filled with light filtering through the tall glass panels.\nNear the entrance is a memorial plaque on the wall commemorating parishioners from the past.\nOverall, the ambience of the church is one of solemn beauty that fostering a deep sense of connection to tradition, spirituality, and the sacred.",

The result is you see a lot more wildlife than you would see in the primary rainforest was my experience.\n\nThat being said we saw Orangutans, all types of monkeys including proboscis, salt water crocodiles, otters and so many birds. This included hornbills, kingfishers, storks, egret. Unfortunately we did not see pygmy elephant.\n\nIf you have limited time in Borneo, this is the easiest way of viewing wildlife in their natural habitat. In terms of accommodation I recomend the Last Frontier Resort.\n\nThe best way to see this wildlife is via boat and most accommodation on the river provide guides and boat tours in both the morning and afternoon.",
