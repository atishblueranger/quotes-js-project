It worths it , I think.\n20 ringgit the entrance/ 40 for the boat in/ out to share with 4 other persons.\nTake electrolytes & water because you deshydrate very quickly there.\nPS: a part of the bridge after the junction to go to Jahur need to be fixed because very unstable.

The people there are nice as well & people will help you if you ever need it. I MOST DEFINITELY wouldn't recommend this hike to beginners/rookies. The first half of the hike can be done by walking but the last half of the hike will require you to use your upperbody strength as there's some rope/rock climbing elements to it at certain points.\n\nThe entrance starts at Taman Negara Santubong. You can park your vehicle by the roadside. Solo hiking isn't allowed for first time visitors. But don't worry if you don't have anyone to tag along with, you'll be able to join other groups of hikers.\n\nEntrance is free but you do need to register before 9am if you plan to hike to the summit. It takes at most 4 hours to reach to the SUMMIT, same as going back down. Timing depends on the individual. If you're too tired to head back all the way down, there's a short cut at F7 know as the Princess Trail. Follow that path & it'll lead you to a roadside. It takes about 30–60 min using that trail.\n\nOnce you're done with your hike, make sure you head back to the registration counter to cross out your name so that they know that you're back safely.\n\nGood luck! All the best! Be careful!!",

It's an epic trail but mainly rocks and tree trunks, especially the summit which is very steep, we couldn't use our hiking poles as we were using our hands to clamber up. Be prepared for a serious ascent and descent. However it's well maintained and we never felt unsafe. Those with serious fear of heights might feel nervous on the ladders\n- take loads of water. Some reviews said there was an honesty box at the top, we didn't see anything and the vending machine at the ranger station was coins only and didn't sell water (soft drinks only). We had 3.5L between two of us and ran out halfway down.\n- the emergency exit for the way down only is after the summit - so you have to come back down the really hard bit whichever way!\n- mandatory to register via ranger station (the hike is free) and you have to start between 8-9am\n\nBuuuut we saw proboscis and silverback monkeys on the way down the normal path, great views at the top, super memorable hike!

Besides that the waterfront has services area to take such as small, classic boat to rent and to cross the river. Moreover it's an acting hub for the Kuching river cruise to buy tickets and the departure/arrival area.

The rangers are very attentive to the safety of the primates and visitors.  At one point, we needed to move out of the area until 2 orangutans moved out of the visitor space. This is about 1 10 minute walk and a paid tram is available.  Most of the area is wheelchair accessible. Small souvenir area with water for purchase.  So awesome to see orangutans up so close.",

There is no guarantee of seeing the orangutan's but the rangers really work hard to try to get them to appear. We saw 3 in the fruiting season Jan/ Feb then it is more unlikely they will appear.

The electric bus, ( air-conditioned, free service and has complimentary wifi) that goes through nearly all attraction through Kuching city takes around 1 hr and 50 min to get to Semmongoh from water front. If you plan on using it download the Kuching metro app and abide by timings they recommend to start from water front to get to Semmongoh. The app unfortunately does not say exactly when it will show up in some of the other stops on its way. It took around 20-25 min from waterfront to viva city mall and about 40-45 min to airport. Do not use Google timings for this bus because they are incorrect or not updated.\n\nThe Nature reserve is a rehabilitation center for orangutans. It seems well preserved as a rainforest except for some occasional man made structure along the way until you get to the feeding area. Feeding times are between 9-10 am and 3-4 pm. There is no guarantee that the orangutans will appear at that time or appear at all. The rainforest does offer variety of food for them. The feeding is still being offered because the preserve does not always have the food orangutans need for a healthy diet. I did not get to see them but it was well worth the visit. If there is rainforest forecasted close to feeding time there is high chance they will not come.",

I mean it doesnt resonate laa.\n\nFood, I ordered carbonara seafood for RM23.90 and it was not it. Food presentation.. meh. Seafood aight, was expecting it to come with mussels, flower cut calamari but no.. sotong biasa 😭 so can u imagine how the carbonara tasted like? It tasted awful.. (tried to finish it but was a nightmare) served in a small plate which I think a bit funny xD the chicken chop, pretty decent, one slice of boneless chicken thigh, one piece of lettuce for RM26.90 hmmm lemme think about that\n\nService was tiptop! Very friendly and we were welcomed warmly hehe I like dat!\n\nI've come here once before, but the food was better and bigger last time. Maybe Carbonara Seafood was not for me. Shouldve ordered something else. Luckily got limau peng to wash everything down.",

You should wear hiking boots for all trails (I tried in sneakers,... not good,.. didn't get far),... and the trail also crosses the river a few times,... so be prepared to get a little wet (especially if it's been raining,... as it had been for me,... thunder storms overnight, and heavyrain in the morning).\n\nIf there have been heavy rains overnight, then it will most likely be that ALL trails will be closed the next day.\n\nIf you want to try the summit, you need to be at the start BEFORE 0900, and those for the loop... before 1200 noon. Trails/ park closes at 1600,... so you need to be done by then.\n\nI've posted a few notices (18MAR25) and pics (from the loop),..

But sadly, when I got there, only 2 out of 10 stalls were open, and most food was already gone. So yeah, we only got whatever leftovers were still there.
