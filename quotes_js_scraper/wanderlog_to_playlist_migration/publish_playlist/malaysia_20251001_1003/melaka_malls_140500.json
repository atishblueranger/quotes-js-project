However, the mall lacks a large grocery store, which can be inconvenient for extended stays or those needing everyday essentials. The dining and entertainment choices are relatively modest, and finding a parking spot could be frustrating. I found quite a long lower-floor alleyway with lots of interesting booths. The mall's design leans on the plain side, lacking the modern flair and lively atmosphere of more contemporary shopping centres. That said, it still serves well for a quick visit, whether after a simple snack, a casual browse, or just a place to rest your feet while exploring the city.",

The design seemed to be of Dutch Colonial themed or inspired, and they looked quite magnificent. I was impressed by the giant windmill located in the centre, which was a major attraction for the visitors. There was also a carousel or merry-go-round, but was not patronized somehow. Most visitors appeared to be contented to just sitting around, soaking in the festive atmosphere...\n\nThe Chinese New Year festive feeling was still in the air. Hence the patrons were mostly chinese families, who had come here as part of their holidays and celebrations. There was also a malay wedding ceremony happening at the Banquet Hall, with various mix of people attending the event.\n\nOther than that, I didnt see much shopping going on, or maybe it was because the CNY sale was already over?",
