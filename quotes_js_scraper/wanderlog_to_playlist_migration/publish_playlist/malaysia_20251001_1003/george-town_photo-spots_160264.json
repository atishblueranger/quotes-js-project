We didn't know that we could drive up to the different levels and pay parking there too. At base level, you can take the lift (funicular) at RM$3 per person to go up to mid level. RM$3 for the down ride. Total RM$6 person.\n\nThe 15 minute walk up to the mid level was not nice as there was no proper walking path or signage & the hot weather made it worse. You can drive up and park at mid level. From mid level, same thing applies. Lift (funicular) RM$3 per person to go up top level to view the large Goddess of Mercy. RM$3 to come down. Unfortunately, the Goddess of Mercy area was closed for upgrading works. At the top level, you get a nice view and there's a temple too. You can also drive up to top level and it's paid parking.\n\nThe pagoda area is worth a visit too. RM$2 per person. It's at the mid level and a short walk only.\n\nIt is a beautiful temple and a must visit place. We enjoyed ourselves and you can spend up to 2hrs there. Wear slip on walking shoes is best.\n\nEnjoy 🥳",

The lower tram isn't working so they put you in a mini van to get to the next level up, then a golf cart to the upper tram. There's no map or guide to help you, and signage is confusing. There's a walk up and through gardens that would have been better than the golf cart. There's no way for first time visitors to understand the layout.\n\nThey want you to go through the stores and you'll miss the best parts on the middle levels if you aren't careful. Take your time to explore all the directions.\n\nIt's quite commercialized. Selling stuff I the Temples seems a little weird.",

There was also a lively market happening at the time, with large variety of items for sale like artwork, plants, clothes, and even nostalgic finds like old books, tiffin carriers, vintage phones and records.\n\nFood options are available too, with a decent variety to suit different tastes.

Our experience at The Habitat was both wonderful (for the exploration & views) & horrific (dark, unsafe, unguarded during the evening)\n🤑💸 For Rm60 for entrance + rm18 for evening walk (per pax), this place is poorly managed in terms of customers safety & expectations. That explains why there were very few visitors entering here at that hour.(I am unsure for the other times of the day of other days)\n👻 Evening around 7.45pm, for about 10 mins walk out to the exit, with no one else in sight, just darkness (a few small little lights on the side walk), the jungle and its sounds, it was scary & spooky. Only saw more lights when we reahed the Langur way canopy walk.\n👎 Some areas were badly maintained & lighting was really bad. Probably they want to ensure the area is kept wild and dark for the animals' natural habitat, that is understandable.\n😰 However, there should have staff at checkpoints along the way to ensure visitors' safety & assurance that they are on the right path.\n👽 When we finally arrive at the entrance, the staff hut (ticketing place) was dark, empty & we saw the huge gate was closed! Suddenly a tall dark man appeared & we though he was another visitor or a guard who will tell us that we are at the wrong place for exit! To our relief, he was indeed a staff or a person guarding the gat& he opened the gate for us.\n🤩 Alhamdulillah, we made it out safely. I was a bit shake.\nAt this point, I would not recommend paying extra for the evening walk, unless there is a good crowd of visitors and proper guide along the way by the staff on duty.",

Both walks felt safe, well-maintained, and offered unique perspectives of Penang's ancient rainforest. It may seem a bit pricey at first, but the experience is totally worth the money for the views and the serenity.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone visiting Penang Hill!",

Most people didn't choose to go on the tour, so we had a small group, which helped to personalise it.\n\nStanley was our guide, and he was extremely good, very practiced and slick. He knew so much about the history of the building, and had a few jokes and personal anecdotes, that helped to make it come alive.\n\nThe house itself is a wonder, giving a real glimpse into the lifestyle of a wealthy Chinese leader of the time. Some of the artworks were exquisite, and while too ornate for present day tastes, they gave an idea of the opulent lifestyle that a small number of people had.\n\nThere were many interesting tales, they didn't sugarcoat difficult historical situations either, explaining about foot binding and opium use, amongst others.\n\nThe thing that impressed me most however, it quite blew me away, was the jewellery made from kingfisher feathers. It represented about 3 years work by a craftsman, is over 100 years old, and still looks fresh.\n\nHopefully that gives a small taste of what the visit was like. It was the most interesting thing we did in Malaysia and for me it would be a definite must see if you spend some time in Georgetown.",

Displayed were v detailed crafts by peranakans like beaded bags and shoes with super micro beads,  to antique furnitures which really brought us back to Little Nonya tv series site.\n\nThe Nonya kebaya rental, hairdo, makeup, photographers and museum ticket entry are at the little building opposite the museum.\n\nimportant note:\nEnsure your engaged photographer time slot is confirmed n written by staff onto your receipt before walking off Nonya Palazzo.\nWe learn it the hard way with a lot of time wasted.\nOur photographer was double booked at our stipulated timing due to the mistake by the staff at counter.\n\nWe were told a photographer slot 2 hours later from our kebaya rental, which we proceed to make payment n set hairdo.\n\nAfter loitering around at museum for 2 hours we came back for photographer and were told that his slot is for another couple.\nThe reason? Their procedure was to confirm timing after our hairdo and dress up so that the timing can be assigned. But this was NOT COMMUNICATED to us at all, and we were CONFIRMED AT STIPULATED TIME during payment. The staff still wrote my name on the list, but missed out writing in the timing.\n\nThe reassigned timing was 2 hours later from original time which by then would be 4 freaking hours wait just for photoshoot, due to front service staff mistake.\n\nBy then we were asking for full refund n ready to walk off, without the much anticipated photoshoot.\n\nSome discussion went on with their boss and photographer managed to squeeze out time  & slot us in after the couple's.\n\nThe photography session went well and the photographer SL handled professionally, despite the arrangement mishap.\nHighly recommend to have professional photographer as he will guide you for Nonya-applicable poses in museum :) which creates very good keepsake memory.\n\nTo museum front counter service staff, we respect your procedure but this isn't your insurance to keep telling customers only after things got screwed up and totally not mention at all prior.\nPlease communicate clearly to your customers, and ensure leave no stones unturned. People don't wait 4 hours just for a photography session when we could have arrange for other itinerary. If you had promised a certain timing, you don't flip your words and said that it was termed “estimated” afterwhich, when it's you missed out on writing down the time onto your sheet.  We went for payment after your confirmed photography time slot. And not “estimated” as claimed.",

The heat of the day had mellowed, and the golden rays of the setting sun cast a magical glow over the entire jetty. The wooden houses on stilts, the gently rippling water, and the silhouettes of boats in the distance made it feel like I had stepped into a postcard.\n\nWalking along the planks with the evening breeze brushing past, I felt completely at ease. There were fewer tourists at this hour, which gave us more time to soak in the peaceful charm and snap some really stunning photos without the crowds. The colors in the sky reflected beautifully off the water, adding to the calm, laid-back vibe of the place.\n\nIt's amazing how this historical clan jetty, with its rustic homes and narrow boardwalks, still stands strong amidst modern George Town. A mix of old-world charm and everyday life, all quietly coexisting over the water.\n\nDefinitely recommend coming around golden hour-it's cooler, calmer, and visually unforgettable.",
