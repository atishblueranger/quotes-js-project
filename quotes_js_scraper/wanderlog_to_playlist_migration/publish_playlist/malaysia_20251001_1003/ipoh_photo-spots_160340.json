Built in 1909 to honor James W.W. Birch, the first British Resident of Perak, the tower is a striking relic of colonial architecture. Located near the Ipoh State Mosque, it rises with Victorian grace, capped with a clock on all four sides and topped with a weather vane.\n\nWhat makes this tower especially unique are the elaborate panels at its base. They depict 44 notable figures-from Confucius to Darwin-marking the evolution of human civilization. At the top, four statues represent core virtues: prudence, justice, fortitude, and temperance, a symbolic reminder of values that transcend time.\n\nBeing here stirred a real sense of appreciation. It's more than just stone and symbolism-it's a lens into our shared, complex past. I truly hope more people, especially the younger generation, take the time to visit and learn from this monument. It's a piece of heritage that deserves to be remembered, talked about, and preserved.\n\nAppreciate you stopping by!

The trees and plants growing near some of the murals, added a fair amount of charm to it. It was very quiet as there were only the 2 of us visiting the time we did. Whilst it felt safe, I can appreciate that individuals visiting on their own may feel hesitant. So, worth coming along with someone.\n\nI enjoyed seeing how each mural represented the different cultural aspects and expressions of Malaysia. I do think that it would be great for the local/ state government have some focus in preserving a number of the murals.\n\nI would visit this place again. Mornings when the temperature is cooler is definitely a recommended time.",

Surprisingly, we also loved their mini zoo. They had a wide variety of animals like capybaras, ponies, zebras, giraffes, hippos, and guinea pigs. Our favorite was the bird zone, where you could walk inside a giant aviary and interact closely with the birds. They also have a tiger feeding show in the afternoon. However, just like many other theme parks in Malaysia, the park was super hot in the afternoon, the food options were limited and overpriced, and some water pools didn't seem very hygienic.",

Highlights and tips:\n- There is an entrance fee of RM4 for Malaysians with an identity card and RM12 for foreigners. Tickets are to be purchased at the entrance at a dedicated counter. Alternatively, can be purchased online 1 day before.\n- Boat ride fees are a separate fee.\n- To access the lake, visitors go through a tunnel to emerge at the lake. It is quite a sight to behold.\n- Once out of the cave, it can be pretty hot and humid. I highly recommend wearing airy clothes suitable for the area and if possible, visit early in the morning when it opens for cooler air.\n- The lake and surrounding areas is beautiful naturally. The area feels peaceful though when there are lots of people, it is still easy to get lost in its beauty.\n- There is quite a number of parking spots for Tasik Cermin 2 but it is also shared with the nearby cafe, Kin Loong Chang Jiang Cafe. When we came, there were almost no available spots and this was about lunchtime.\n- Data connection was quite spotty in the area.\n\nThere were a few things that fell short for this place:\n- With the number of boat rides, the beauty of the surrounding mountains, trees & limestone surfaces is not reflected well anymore.\n- Even on a weekday, it can get pretty crowded.\n- Not everyone is very understanding and can just stand in front of your frame or block you from taking photos.\n- It can get extremely hot.\n\nIt was a good visit and it did enjoy my time there except for some drawbacks. It would be a good first time visit though not quite sure with all the disrupted reflective views, it would require more for me to head back again.",
