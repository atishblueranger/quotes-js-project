There are also plenty of dining options, ranging from popular international brands to local delicacies, ensuring there's something for everyone.\n\nEven small details stand out here-like their uniquely designed washroom signboards, which add to the mall's creative and themed atmosphere.\n\nWith a great mix of luxury and mid-range retail stores, Sunway Pyramid is a must-visit destination whether you're shopping, dining, or just looking for a fun day out!",

            "text": "IOI Mall Puchong may not be the flashiest or most luxurious mall in the Klang Valley, but it holds a firm place in the heart of the local community. Strategically located right along the LDP Highway and directly connected to the IOI Puchong Jaya LRT station, this mall is one of the easiest to access - whether you're driving or taking public transport. For many Puchong folks, this is the go-to mall for daily shopping, dining, or just spending a laid-back afternoon.\n\nAccessibility & Convenience\nThe convenience of getting here is a big plus. If you're coming by LRT, there's a covered pedestrian link bridge that connects directly from the IOI Puchong Jaya station to the mall. For those who drive, parking is quite manageable with both outdoor and multi-level parking bays. The location along the LDP makes it very visible and accessible for residents in Puchong, Bandar Kinrara, and even Subang or Sunway.\n\nRetail & Shopping\nWhile you won't find high-end luxury brands here, the mall does cover a wide range of retail needs. There's a good mix of mid-range fashion outlets, sporting goods, accessories, electronics, mobile phone shops, and bookstores. The AEON department store and supermarket is a popular anchor tenant, offering everything from groceries and daily essentials to household items and clothing.\n\nWhat stands out in IOI Mall is the dedicated IT section - a whole area filled with computer shops, phone accessory vendors, repair kiosks, and tech gadget stores. Whether you're looking for a new laptop, computer parts, a printer, or just getting your phone fixed, this IT zone is quite comprehensive and convenient.\n\nFood & Beverage Heaven\nOne of the biggest reasons people love coming here is the food. IOI Mall has no shortage of dining options, catering to all budgets and cravings. There are more than three steamboat and BBQ restaurants inside or adjacent to the mall - including hotpot chains and Korean BBQ options. It's a great spot if you're craving something hearty and want to enjoy a group meal.\n\nBeyond that, the mall also hosts a Food Street-style zone offering local Malaysian dishes, snacks, and desserts. You'll also find well-known fast food outlets like McDonald's, KFC, Texas Chicken, Subway, and more.\n\nIf you're into coffee and drinks, IOI Mall has an impressive lineup of beverage brands. From big international names like Starbucks and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf, to local favourites like ZUS Coffee, Daily Coffee, HWC, and Chagee, there's no shortage of caffeine and bubble tea options. Whether you're looking for a quiet café to work from or just grabbing a quick drink, the choices are solid and spread across the mall.\n\nEntertainment & Atmosphere\nThe mall has a TGV Cinema that screens all the latest blockbusters, plus a family-friendly environment with arcades and children's play areas. On weekends, you'll see pop-up booths, exhibitions, or local craft markets at the central concourse.\n\nThe atmosphere here is more casual and community-focused than upscale. It may not have the modern polish of malls like Pavilion or The Exchange TRX, but it's comfortable, clean, and functional. Some parts of the mall are older, but general maintenance is decent. Escalators and restrooms are usually in good working condition, and the mall is air-conditioned throughout.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nIOI Mall Puchong is what you might call a “local hero” - a mall that may not try to be everything for everyone, but gets the basics right. It's practical, accessible, and offers a well-rounded mix of shopping, food, entertainment, and services. The added convenience of the LRT station, tech and IT zone, plus the growing number of trendy drink spots and steamboat restaurants, makes it very relevant even as newer malls pop up around the Klang Valley.\n\nWhether you're here for groceries, grabbing dinner, catching a movie, or just sipping coffee with a friend, IOI Mall provides a reliable and familiar space - one that continues to evolve without losing its neighborhood charm.",

It's slightly bigger than the existing one (Taurus & Bunny) as it offers indoor gokart as well (different price). The entrance fees are reasonable on weekdays but quite expensive on weekend/PH considering the place is not too big for the kids to explore. Other than that, it lacks facilities like toilets and baby rooms. However the staffs are helpful and kind, the place is clean too. Overall, recommended for families to have fun and enjoy their time together.",

With four levels of shops, you'll find a mix of fashion, lifestyle, and services, plus a food court on the Ground Floor offering a good variety of food options. Parking is also convenient and reasonably priced.\n\nHowever, there's room for improvement. At times, the mall gives off a bit of an old-school or heritage feel, especially with some lesser-known outlets. It would be great if the management could bring in more well-known brands to refresh the mall and attract more visitors.\n\nStill, it remains a charming and relaxing spot-especially if you're looking for something different from the typical mall experience.",

The mall itself is clean, modern, and generally has a nice environment with friendly staff and a good crowd. However, there are a few things I noticed that I think really need improvement.\n\nFirst of all, I was surprised to see that there isn't a supermarket or grocery store inside the mall. For a place in such a prime location with so many visitors, it's honestly disappointing. Many people – including tourists, families, and locals – often look for a place to grab essentials or do quick grocery shopping after dining or walking around. Not having that option makes the mall feel incomplete.\n\nAnother thing is the baby room. While I appreciate that there is one, it's really small and doesn't have hot or warm water, which is important for families with babies. If you're a parent and need to prepare milk or clean up, it's not very convenient. I really hope they consider upgrading this facility to better support family visitors.\n\nI like this mall and see its potential, but these small things make a big difference. A grocery store and better family-friendly facilities would make the mall much more useful and complete for everyday needs.",

If you're planning to buy clothes for your babies this is the place for you plenty of choices compare to other Aeons. I had a good experience during my last visit 17th March 2025 around 3pm until 5pm the cashier who attended me is very respectful and with a smile his name Mr Amir Iman kids dept I saw his name tag you can spot him in my pic I posted. Good service and happy customer but I disappointed with the info counter staff when I reach him to find a food stall Mr Pan Mee the male staff in the counter said go to the supermarket can find there and I went all the way to find but I couldn't find then I asked the opposite stall staff she said it's permanently closed it's bad to know the info counter is not updated. Otherwise all good. You may reach out their TikTok page (Aeon Taman Maluri) for the current updates. It's very easy for customers. Thank you",

Similar to the Exchange TRX, LaLaport Bukit Bintang City Centre has a nice rooftop garden plus a beautiful art deco style cinema ( GSC LaLaport BBCC) which many people say is the most Instagrammable cinema in Malaysia (very plush interiors). Whilst there, also check out the LED stairs and the excellent outdoor food street which has lots of super cheap lunchtime specials.",

One of the first things I appreciated was the variety of shops. Ranging from international brands to local favorites, which gave me plenty of options for both shopping and browsing. The food court was another highlight, offering a mix of Japanese, Asian, and Western cuisine. It was clean, well-organized, and had enough seating even during peak hours. I especially liked the presence of some niche eateries that are hard to find in other malls. What stood out to me the most was the attention to design and atmosphere. The interiors were aesthetically pleasing and there was a calm, relaxed vibe throughout. It didn't feel overly commercial or rushed, which made the experience more pleasant. I also noticed that the facilities were well-maintained. Restrooms were clean and there were plenty of places to rest or wait comfortably.",

But now, only the one on Level 1 remains-and it's not very big either. It gets extremely crowded on weekends.\n\nPlease consider bringing back more free play areas. They really encourage families with children, like mine, to shop and dine at your mall. In fact, the free play areas were the main reason we decided to visit in the first place.",
