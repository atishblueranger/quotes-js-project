Seafood were fresh taken from the ocean, I guess. Crab wasn't too oily and greasy, just perfectly cooked. Beverages were normal, nothing interesting. Loved it though. The price was affordable. Service was great and the staff was friendly and helpful. Would love to recommend to other people out there and I'd definitely will come again soon :D",

She took me to the kichen and showed us some fish from which I was able to choose which one we wanted. Had the fish in a hot and sour sauce which was great. Cheap beer here too, or at least seemingly cheaper than 7-11 at RM6.50 for a can of Tiger. I think the whole meal came to about £13 (RM 65) with 4 beers.\n\nWe enjoyed watching the kittens and aren't bothered about any other 'wildlife' that may or may not be scurrying around, I actually didn't see anything else that other people have mentioned in previous reviews, it's Asia, get over it!",
