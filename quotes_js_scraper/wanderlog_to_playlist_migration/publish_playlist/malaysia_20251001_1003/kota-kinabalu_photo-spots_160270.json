I chose to stay outside since I wasn't sure what to do inside a mosque. The heat was intense, and because the location is a bit far from the city center, it took longer than usual to hail a Grab or taxi. I had to look for shade while waiting. I stayed for about 5 to 10 minutes-just enough time to take a photo-then headed back.",

The place is clean, well-organized, and perfect for a family outing.\n\nThe monkeys were super fun to watch-full of energy and always up to something.\n\nThe elephants were calm and majestic. One even gave us a little water show with its trunk!\n\nLoved the colorful parrots-they were chatting away and added so much life to the aviary.\n\nThe tigers were stunning. Powerful, graceful, and just awe-inspiring to see up close.\n\nThe deer were gentle and came close enough to feed-such a peaceful experience.\n\nYou can tell the animals are well cared for, and the staff is friendly and informative. Highly recommend visiting if you're an animal lover or just looking for a great day out!",

It was annoying they have no bears anymore as they don't tell you that before you get the ticket.\n\nThey are doing some work to the elephant house so they have moved but are visible and quite close.\n\nThere's one tiger and one leopard. Both hide during the day so you might get a hidden shot of them laying down.\n\nThey do have feeding times for the animals, we didn't watch that but would imagine that would be good.\n\nYou'll spend a couple hours here. Annoyingly they close 1-2pm so you can't get food or get into buy any tickets. So prepare for that.\n\nIt's quite far out and we had to pay double for a taxi to pick us up - 40.",

            "text": "We visited this zoo and were quite surprised – most of the animals don't look very well, especially the tiger. He looked like he might be drugged or just very old. Honestly, we came here mainly to see the proboscis monkeys, and yes – they are here and they are amazing! I'm not sure if they just didn't like us or if they're not very friendly with people, but they didn't come close. Still, we managed to take a few nice photos.\n\nAs for the rest of the animals, there aren't that many, so don't expect to spend a full day here. You couldn't anyway – the park is open from around 9:30 am to 1:00 pm, then it closes for lunch and reopens at 2:00 pm. We went in the afternoon. Getting a taxi back was a bit stressful – no one accepted our booking for more than 20 minutes, and since it's over half an hour by car from Kota Kinabalu, we were worried we'd have to walk! So definitely have a backup plan for transport.\n\nThe zoo itself is quite small and can be walked through slowly in about an hour. We spent another 30 minutes just sitting and watching the proboscis monkeys. Other animals you can see here include elephants, tigers, bears, different kinds of birds (parrots, toucans – I think – and owls), orangutans (though they were barely visible and not active at all), otters, ostriches, cows, and a few others.\n\nEntrance is 20 MYR per person for non-Malaysians. A taxi from Kota Kinabalu costs about 20–35 MYR one way.\n\nOverall, is it worth it? Yes – but only for the proboscis monkeys. They are the main highlight. Otherwise, there isn't much to see, and sadly, many of the animals seem to be in poor condition, possibly because they're old or not well cared for. On site, there's a small snack shop with drinks and a souvenir store.",

There's a variety of local snacks and street food to try, but overall, the prices are quite pricey for what you get.\n\nIt's also very crowded, and there's no proper place to sit and eat - no tables, so it's not that comfortable, especially for tourists who might expect a more convenient dining setup.\n\nStill, it's worth a visit if you just want to soak in the atmosphere, try a few bites, and see what the locals have to offer.

This man was the first District Officer of Jesselton – KK’s colonial name – who sadly died at just twenty-eight years of age after having helped establish the city.",
