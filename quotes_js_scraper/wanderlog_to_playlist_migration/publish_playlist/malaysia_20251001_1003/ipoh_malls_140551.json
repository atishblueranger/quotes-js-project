There are a lot of parking spaces so for the most part you don't have to worry about finding a suitable parking space for your vehicle. In front of the mall near the entrance into the mall, you can find a lot of eateries offering different types of food and drinks.There are several fast food chains inside the mall such as Marrybrown, Subway, and Big Apple Donuts & Coffee. The mall is clean and tidy for the most part except there are a lot of vendors selling food products and clothes inside the mall so it could be overwhelming for those who don't like to be around a lot of stuff and things like that. One big thing that I noticed is that the mall is not as cold or frigid as others such as Lotus or Aeon so I don't know what's up with the air conditioning system inside the mall. The escalators are poorly maintained and they are making weird noises as you ride them. I have to give credits to the products that the mall is offering. There are a lot of Malaysian made products as well as international products inside the mall. The products that are being offered ranging from plastic products, canned foods, confectioneries, soft drinks to undergarments, shoes, personal care products and wooden furnitures. The prices are quite reasonable but some products could be a whole lot more expensive than others so make sure you know what you are buying. Best to go for all the discounted products for more bang for your buck but just watch out for the expiry date because those discounted products could reach their expiry date in a few months to come or more but not all. You can see the price tags being displayed on the racks and compare the prices yourself. Overall a great experience for me shopping at the mall with my family. Definitely will visit again in the future if I had a chance. I guess that's all that I want to say. 👍👍👍🇲🇾🇲🇾🇲🇾",

There were no trolleys available at the usual trolley bay, which caused visitors to go up and down between the ground floor and 1st floor, walking a long way just to look for one.\n\nLater I asked the staff and found out that all the remaining trolleys were placed at Shopping Lane 2, which is not the proper place to keep them. This is very inconvenient for customers.\n\nI hope management can improve the trolley arrangement so shoppers can easily find them at the designated trolley areas.",
