Parking is available along the road.\n\nFor my first trail, I hiked to the Raptor Nest. The path is well-covered with large rocks, making it easy to walk and beginner-friendly. Along the way, there's a small river with a jetty, kayak area, and a little café where you can enjoy a cup of coffee or even a Maggi cup. It's a great spot to rest and take in the scenery.\n\nAfter recharging, you can continue on to the next hill within Sireh Park. I started my hike around 8:00 AM and got back to the parking area by 10:00 AM. Be ready to sweat-it was a good workout!\n\nTotal distance: approx. 4.89 km\nCalories burned: approx. 1251 kcal",
