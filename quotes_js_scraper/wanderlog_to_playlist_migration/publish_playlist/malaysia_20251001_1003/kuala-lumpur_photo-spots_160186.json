Parking is normally affordable in the one level basement directly under the square and you can climb the stairs up easily. During the festival, only vendors were allowed to park there, so I left my car at Rumah Tangsi next to Bank Rakyat. It was very convenient and only a short walking distance to the square on event days.\n\nThe square is well maintained with a large open field that many Malaysian families use for picnics, games with children and enjoying the outdoors. It is also a popular spot for tourists, so expect it to be more packed on weekend evenings.\n\nThe food during the event was excellent, served from food trucks with many different choices. Portions were satisfying and the variety made it enjoyable for everyone. On most weekends there are events or activities happening here, so there is often something special to try.\n\nThe atmosphere at night is lively, with bright lights, music and people creating a festive mood. Entry is free and that makes it even better. Crowds and traffic are heavier on weekends, but it adds to the city experience.\n\nMerdeka Square is open all day and night. PARKING INFO ADDED\n\nThe best time to visit is in the evening when the surrounding heritage buildings, especially the Sultan Abdul Samad Building, are beautifully lit up.\n\nTip for visitors: bring a picnic mat so you can sit comfortably on the grass and enjoy the view.",

Walking around this area feels like stepping back in time, as the historical design blends so gracefully with the modern city around it. It's a spot that truly showcases the cultural heritage of Kuala Lumpur and makes you appreciate how much history is preserved amidst all the skyscrapers.\n\nThis was my first visit, and I was really excited to capture some beautiful photos and videos. Unfortunately, during my trip, part of the building was undergoing renovation. While it's great to see that efforts are being made to restore and maintain these historic structures, it meant that some sections were covered or inaccessible, and I couldn't get the perfect shots I was hoping for.\n\nEven so, I still enjoyed exploring the area and taking in the details of the architecture that was visible. I definitely plan to come back once the renovation is complete, because I can already imagine how stunning the building will look when fully restored. It's truly a must‑visit spot for anyone who loves history, photography, or simply appreciating the beauty of Kuala Lumpur.",

It looks super pretty if you come during the day with blue skies and clouds in the background, but it can get really hot and sunny, and there's not much shade. So bring an umbrella if you're visiting in the daytime.\n\nThere's a paid basement parking nearby.

Batu Cave is an absolutely breathtaking cultural and spiritual landmark in Malaysia. The towering golden statue of Lord Muruga is truly majestic and awe-inspiring, welcoming visitors with a powerful presence. Climbing the colorful staircase to the main cave is a rewarding experience, offering stunning views and a deep sense of peace and reverence. The temple inside the cave is serene and filled with vibrant Hindu traditions, making it a must-visit for anyone interested in culture, spirituality, or photography.\n\nThe entire area is well-maintained, with facilities and shops nearby for refreshments and souvenirs. The cave formations, combined with the religious significance, create a truly unique experience. Visiting early in the morning adds to the calm and allows for a more personal spiritual moment. A perfect place to admire natural beauty and cultural richness in one visit. Highly recommended.",

The weather is much friendlier before the sun gets too high, making your workout more enjoyable. There are tons of paths to explore, from wide-open walkways to more secluded trails where you can find a bit of solitude. I was also surprised to discover a concert hall within the park, which adds to its unique charm.\nThe park is beautiful and incredibly well-maintained.

This was my second time here and previously i went during the day, however i would recommended heading up before sunset , seeing sunset and then heading down after dark. It's absolutely beautiful to see the city in both daytime and nighttime. It is worth noting too that after sunset the observation deck did get a lot quieter. As someone who isn't fond of lifts it is over within a few minutes and staff are constantly monitoring them.",

The moment you stand in front of the entrance, you're struck by the colorful and detailed tower gate (gopuram) that rises high above the street. Covered in hundreds of intricately carved and painted deities, the facade is a masterpiece of South Indian Dravidian architecture.\n\nAs you step inside, the atmosphere changes instantly-peaceful, spiritual, and filled with the scent of incense. The interior is equally beautiful, with shrines dedicated to various Hindu deities, including Lord Ganesha, Lord Shiva, and Goddess Durga. Every statue is decorated with fresh flowers and silk garments, and the attention to detail is absolutely incredible.\n\nWhat I found especially touching was how the space is open to both worshippers and curious visitors. People were taking photos respectfully, while others offered prayers or lit incense. It felt like a sacred place that also welcomed cultural exchange.\n\nIf you're in Kuala Lumpur, this temple is a must-visit-not only for its visual beauty, but for the sense of serenity and cultural richness it offers. It's free to enter, but please dress modestly and be respectful of the rituals taking place. I truly appreciated the hospitality and the opportunity to learn more about Hindu culture through this beautiful site.",

Inside, the temple is just as beautiful, with richly painted ceilings, polished floors, and sacred shrines surrounded by fresh flowers and oil lamps.\n\nIt's a peaceful space with a real sense of devotion and tradition. You might even catch a short prayer ceremony while visiting. Don't forget to remove your shoes at the entrance and dress respectfully.

Getting there is easiest with Grab, but if you don't mind a short walk, the train is also an option. I went on a Wednesday, and it was pretty quiet, which made the atmosphere feel extra calm and peaceful.\n\nWhen it comes to the dress code, modesty is important. Women should avoid revealing clothes, but a light scarf works great if you want to cover up quickly. Long skirts or dresses are ideal, while men are fine wearing shorts.\n\nOne of the highlights was catching the sunset from the temple. I only got to see it for a brief moment, but it was absolutely magical. Other than that, the whole environment feels serene, peaceful, and just really chill-a perfect place to sit back, soak it all in, and enjoy the calm.",

Inside your should leave your shoes near the entrance.\n\nI really like this place even as a traveller, beautifully decorated, with many details, don't miss opportunity to walk inside and outside. There are many amazing zones for photographs\n\nInside you can get an answer on your questions using special number boards. Check the video to see see what you should do :)\n\nThere is a dress code inside (check one of the pictures)",

Parking was somewhat easy to find on a Saturday night but parking is expensive. Not much crowd here so it's nice to dine in & walk around with a big tree and nice view. But there isn't a lot of stores here. Most people come here to eat i would say. Overall a great nice plaza / mall to be. The toilets are also well maintained and smells decent. 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻",

The market is larger than I expected, bustling with energy, shops, and a wide variety of goods ranging from clothes and accessories to souvenirs and local street food.\n\nPrices are generally not expensive, but be prepared to negotiate-bargaining is absolutely essential here. One important tip: never reveal your offer price first. It's always better to let the vendors quote their lowest price before you start negotiating. With a bit of patience and good negotiation skills, you can score some great deals.\n\nThat said, the area could use some improvement in terms of cleanliness and overall hygiene. While the atmosphere is vibrant and lively, a bit more attention to sanitation would really enhance the visitor experience.\n\nOverall, it's a fun and colorful place to explore, especially if you enjoy street shopping and local culture. Just go in with the right mindset and be ready to haggle!",

This is the oldest Taoist temple in Kuala Lumpur, founded in 1864 by Yap Ah Loy, one of the city's early Chinese Kapitans. Tucked down a narrow alley off Jalan Tun H S Lee, the temple is a peaceful, atmospheric escape from the busy streets outside.\n\nInside, it's a sensory experience - thick incense, glowing red lanterns, and centuries-old wooden carvings. Every corner is filled with colour and symbolism, from the altar to the fortune-telling sticks and prayer offerings. You'll also find vibrant red and gold detailing, traditional tiled floors, and beautiful antique decorations that reflect a strong mix of Chinese-Malay heritage.\n\nWhether you're stopping in to soak up the atmosphere, take photos, or quietly reflect, this temple offers a unique glimpse into KL's early Chinese community and spiritual traditions. Don't miss the outdoor incense urns and side altars - and look out for the pineapple and fruit offerings!",

The entrance is quite hidden, but once you step inside, you're welcomed into a completely different world - a retro and stylish interior with a rustic charm. The slightly worn walls and wooden furniture create a warm, cozy atmosphere that makes you want to stay for hours.\n\nThe menu offers a creative mix of Asian and Western fusion dishes, all served in generous portions. The seafood pasta, loaded with prawns and clams, was especially delicious - creamy yet with a nice spicy kick that kept me coming back for more. The cheesy meatball gratin and crispy hot fries on the side were also very satisfying.\n\nDrinks are just as unique. I ordered a chocolate frappe that came with a whole donut on top - not only Instagram-worthy, but also rich and indulgent in flavor, almost like a dessert on its own.\n\nPrices are not the cheapest, as it's a popular tourist spot, but considering the ambiance and quality of food, it's definitely worth it. It's the perfect place to take a break while exploring Chinatown, and I recommend ordering a few dishes to share with friends. A must-visit café when you're in Kuala Lumpur!",
