It's not just a lake – it's a way of life for the people here.\n\nThe atmosphere is clean, refreshing, and perfect for photography. Whether you're a nature lover, a couple looking for a romantic getaway, or a family wanting to enjoy the calmness, Dal Lake has something for everyone.\n\nHighly recommended as a must-visit spot in Srinagar!"

Pari Mahal, which translates to \"Abode Of Fairies\" is a seven-terraced garden located atop the Zabarwan mountain range. This location offers tourists a stunning view of Srinagar and Dal Lake. It is said to have been developed by Dara Shikoh, showcasing exquisite Islamic architecture. Tickets can be purchased from the counter near the entrance gate. The beautifully preserved and decorated gardens of all seven terraces are sure to leave a lasting impression on tourists. The structures are remarkable to see, as they historically served as a library, an observatory for astrology and astronomy, and a place of residence. The site has neat and clean washrooms. Wheelchair access is doubtful and should be checked with the authorities. Parking is available in front of the main entrance. Overall, it is a lovely terraced garden well worth visiting. Great job by Archeological Survey Of India."

Perched atop Shankaracharya Hill, the temple offers the best 360-degree view of Srinagar, including breathtaking vistas of Dal Lake, Jhelum River, snow-capped mountains, and the entire cityscape.\n\nThe climb to the temple involves a series of well-maintained steps, and though it requires some effort for 250 steps to climb, but the serene ambiance and divine energy make it worthwhile. Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple holds deep historical and religious significance, as it is believed that Adi Shankaracharya meditated here in the 8th century. The architecture is simple yet spiritually powerful, creating a peaceful environment for prayer and meditation.\n\nSecurity is tight, and visitors are not allowed to carry mobile phones or cameras inside, so it’s best to soak in the experience without distractions. The best time to visit is early morning or evening when the weather is pleasant, and the view is especially magical.\n\nOverall, Shri Adi Shankaracharya Temple is an enriching experience for devotees, history enthusiasts, and nature lovers alike. A visit here provides not just spiritual fulfillment but also the most stunning panoramic view of Srinagar."

It's like, totally on top of this hill, you gotta climb a bunch of steps, felt like forever, man! But once you get to the top, the view is, like, whoa! You can see the whole Srinagar city and Dal Lake looking all shiny.\nThe temple itself is pretty old school, you know? Like something out of history class. There's this Shiva lingam inside, and it felt kinda peaceful, even with all the people around. My parents were all into the prayers and stuff, but I was mostly digging the view and imagining what it must have been like back in the day.\nIt's a bit of a trek to get up there, so wear your comfiest sneakers, for sure. And maybe bring some water, 'cause you'll get thirsty climbing all those stairs. Overall, it was a pretty cool experience, something different from the usual touristy stuff. Worth checking out if you're ever in Srinagar, ya know? Peace out!"

Nestled in the serene surroundings of Srinagar, this ancient temple over 2500 years old, radiates immense positive energy and divine presence.\n\nThe moment you step into the temple premises, you can feel a deep sense of peace and spirituality. The Darshan of the sacred Shivlingam is incredibly powerful, filling you with energy and inner calm. Equally moving is the Tapsya Sthal (meditation site) of Adi Shankaracharya, where the great sage has meditated. The atmosphere here is charged with devotion and positive vibrations, making it a must-visit for anyone seeking spiritual upliftment.\n\nWhether you're a devotee or a seeker, the Adi Shankaracharya Temple leaves a lasting impression on the heart and soul."

Perched atop Shankaracharya Hill, it offers breathtaking panoramic views of Srinagar city and the Dal Lake. The climb involves around 200+ steps, but the peaceful vibes and the scenery make it worth every step.\n\nThe temple itself is small but deeply spiritual, dedicated to Lord Shiva, with a history dating back over a thousand years. Photography is not allowed inside for security reasons, but the memories stay with you."

              "reviewText": "Chashme Shahi, also known as the Royal Spring, is one of the most beautiful and serene Mughal gardens in Srinagar, Kashmir. Built in 1632 by Ali Mardan Khan under the orders of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan for his son Dara Shikoh, this charming garden is the smallest among the three famous Mughal gardens in Srinagar, but it holds immense historical and natural beauty. The garden is built around a natural spring that was discovered by Rupa Bhawani, a revered Kashmiri saint, and is believed to have medicinal properties. Many visitors even bring bottles to take some of the spring water home. The layout of Chashme Shahi follows the traditional Mughal garden style with three terraced levels, each adorned with well-maintained flowerbeds, flowing water channels, and small fountains that create a soothing, musical ambiance. What makes this garden unique is the natural spring that flows through each level, adding to its charm and peaceful environment. Set against the backdrop of the Zabarwan mountains and overlooking the shimmering Dal Lake, the views from Chashme Shahi are absolutely breathtaking. During spring and early summer, the garden bursts into a riot of colors with blooming tulips, roses, and other flowers, making it a paradise for nature lovers and photographers. It’s a great place for a relaxing walk, a quiet picnic, or just some moments of peace amidst nature. The entry fee is minimal, and the garden is open from March to November, usually from 9:30 AM to 5:30 PM. Easily accessible from Srinagar city, it’s located near the Raj Bhawan and is often included in day tours along with Nishat and Shalimar Bagh. Overall, Chashme Shahi is a must-visit destination that offers beauty, history, and tranquility in one perfect package."

              "reviewText": "Chashma Shahi or Chashma i Shahi (translation: the royal spring), also called Chashma Shahi, is one of the Mughal gardens built in 1632 AD around a spring by Ali Mardan Khan, a governor of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as per the orders of the Emperor, as a gift for his elder son Prince Dara Shikoh. The garden is located in the Zabarwan Range, near Raj Bhawan (Governor‘s house) overlooking Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir\n\nHistory\nThe garden was constructed around the spring by the Mughal Governor Ali Mardan Khan in 1632. It was commissioned by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan for his eldest son, Dara Sikoh. In the east of Chashma Shahi the Pari Mahal (Fairy Palace) lies where Dara Sikoh used to learn astrology.The garden is 108 m long and 38 m wide and is spread over one acre of land. It is the smallest garden among the three Mughal gardens of Srinagar; the Shalimar garden is the largest and the Nishat garden is the second largest. All the three gardens were built at the right bank of the Dal Lake, with Zabarwan mountains (Zabarwan Range) at the backdrop.\n\nArchitecture and the spring\nThe garden presents Mughal architecture as used in different Mughal gardens. The artistically build garden has Iranian influence in its art and architecture and the design is based on the Persian gardens. It is built around a fresh water spring, which flows through its centre in terraces. The topography and the steepness of the land have led the formation of the garden. The main focus of the garden is the spring which flows down in terraces and is divided into three sections: an aqueduct, waterfall, and fountains. A two-storey Kashmiri hut stands at the first terrace which is the origin of the spring. The water then flows down through a water ramp (chadar) into the second terrace. The second terrace serves as a water pool and a large fountain stands at its centre. The water again flows down through a water ramp into the third terrace, which is a square five-fountain pool. It is the lowest pool at the entrance of the garden. The visitors are received through a flight of stairs on both sides of the terraces which leads up to the origin of the spring. The water of the spring is believed to have some medicinal properties. The former Premier of India, Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru, used to get the water of the spring to Delhi.\n\nAccess\nThe Chashme Shahi is located within the jurisdiction of Srinagar city, 14 kilometres (9 mi) in the northeast from the Srinagar Airport. It is adjacent to Rajbhawan (Governor’s house). The garden is connected by the Boulevard Road which passes along the banks of the Dal lake. There are many hotels and restaurants available for boarding and lodging near the garden. The garden remains open for tourists from March to November. The best time to visit the garden is from April to October. The garden is at full bloom during May and June."

Named after the four majestic Chinar trees that stand on the island, the place offers breathtaking views of the surrounding mountains and calm waters. It’s accessible by a shikara ride, which in itself is a peaceful and scenic experience. The island is small, but its charm lies in its simplicity and natural beauty. The tall, ancient Chinar trees provide shade and a sense of history, making it a perfect spot to relax, click pictures, or enjoy a quiet moment.\n\nWhile the island doesn’t have many modern amenities, it’s a great place to experience the raw, untouched side of Kashmir. Some visitors note that maintenance could be improved, but the natural charm more than makes up for it. It’s especially beautiful during autumn when the Chinar leaves turn golden and red. Vendors on shikaras often float by with snacks and souvenirs, adding to the unique experience. Overall, Char Chinar is a peaceful retreat in the heart of Dal Lake, ideal for a short stop while exploring Srinagar's beauty. You must mention this place in you bucket list"

Make sure to buy some of the traditional Kashmiri handicrafts and handlooms items and do try out few of the state’s world famous ‘Wazwan’ delicacies before returning from a memorable holiday in Kashmir.\nToday I came to visit Dal Lake  on in Srinagar Kashmi on 27 July 2025 and last year in 2024 i had also come in August month .\n\nDal Lake is a major tourist attraction in Srinagar, drawing visitors from around the world.\n\nDal Lake in Srinagar is also famous for its picturesque beauty, unique houseboats and shikaras, and vibrant floating gardens.

The botanical garden was set up in 1969 and fully established in 1987 in memory of India's first Prime Minister. The garden has a collection of about 150,000 ornamental plants and a huge collection of oak varieties with a lake that spreads over 17 hectares. Admission is 30rs for adults and 100rs for foreigners. An absolutely breathtaking and a beautiful place to spend the day with family and friends. I highly recommend"

The garden's design and layout are well-planned, making it easy to explore and discover new wonders.\n\nOne of the highlights of the Botanical Garden Chashme Shahi is its tranquil ambiance, which makes it an ideal spot for relaxation and contemplation. We spent hours strolling through the garden, taking in the sights and sounds of nature, and feeling rejuvenated and refreshed.\n\nThe garden is also a great place for nature lovers and photography enthusiasts, with plenty of opportunities to capture stunning images of flowers, trees, and wildlife. Whether you're looking for a peaceful retreat or a spot for nature photography, the Botanical Garden Chashme Shahi is a must-visit destination in Srinagar.\n\nOverall, we were impressed by the beauty and tranquility of the Botanical Garden Chashme Shahi, and we would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Srinagar.

There is a pretty big variety of plants in the garden, and although maybe not as photogenic as some of the other ones, I think it might be the best if you're looking for a good walk or a place to relax.\n\nThe price of admission was fairly reasonable for what you get (I think it was around 200 rupees for a foreigner). Would recommend if you're looking for a place for a relaxing stroll or you have some time to kill."

As soon as you enter, you’re greeted by an endless variety of flowers, trees, and perfectly manicured lawns — every corner worthy of a postcard.\n\nI spent hours walking along the winding paths, under towering chinars and blossoming magnolias, soaking in the fresh air and mountain views. The garden is vast, yet every part of it feels intentional — from the pine-scented breeze to the bursts of color that surprise you around every turn.\n\nIt’s not just for plant lovers. It’s for anyone who needs to press pause, to just sit and let time slow down. Families were picnicking, kids playing, couples strolling, all surrounded by the calm that only a place like this can offer.\n\nIf you’re visiting Srinagar, take a break from the tourist buzz and spend an afternoon here. Bring a book, bring a camera — or just bring yourself. This place has a quiet magic that heals."

It has a peaceful atmosphere and some variety of trees and plants, though it doesn't feel very well-maintained in parts. The layout is simple, and there are open green spaces which are good for a relaxed walk or a short break.\n\nThere isn’t much in terms of rare botanical attractions, and if you’ve seen other well-known gardens in Srinagar, like Shalimar or Nishat, this one may feel a bit underwhelming. Still, it's a calm place to unwind for a while, especially if you're looking for some quiet time away from the crowds."

It is also called \"the place of love.\" Emperor Jahangir built it first in 1619, and later his wife, Nur Jahan, made it bigger. Visited this amazing place in May 2024.\nThe garden looks amazing with three flat grassy areas and a long stream of water going down the middle. There are also lots of green plants everywhere. Inside, there are two old important buildings. One is called Diwan-e-Aam, where regular people used to meet the emperor. The other is Diwan-e-Khas, for private meetings. The buildings were under renovation then. Lots of people like taking pictures there. The garden feels magical and makes everybody happy. Kids of all ages enjoy coming to this garden. You need to buy tickets to go inside the garden. You can park your car there, and there are also parking spots on the street outside. Near the garden, there are many small shops selling things like quick food, ice cream, cold drinks, and snacks. It is a place you should definitely visit if you go to Kashmir."

This is a trend that you can see in almost all mughal gardens of Srinagar.\nThe park was clean and somewhat well maintained.\n\nI would suggest renting a digital camera yourself from home. The photographers here charge exorbant amounts for simple pictures. We took 2 group pictures. The price that the photographer quoted for printing 2 copies each of the photos was ₹800. That kinda price is unheard of. It should have costed ₹250 max."

Hari Parbat is also known as Kooh-e-Maran lies on the west of Dal Lake in Srinagar, in the UT of Jammu & Kashmir.\n\nThis Mughal structure was built by an Afghan Governor Atta Mohammed Khan in 18th century. Later a long wall was constructed in 1590 by Emperor Akbar. Surrounded by commendable structures from all religions, this fort sits at the top giving a spectacular view of Dal Lake.\n\nThe cost of entry is 50 Rs for Indians and 100 Ra for foreigners. It is a walk of about 20 minutes to the fort. You will be walking up a gradual incline as well as many steps to get to the fort so appropriate shoes should be worn.\n\nThere is a large military presence within the fort (30+ soldiers I counted) and a few checkpoints on the way but everyone is very friendly.\n\nThere is a mosque, masjid and mandir located in the fort which was a wonderful surprise.\n\nThis fort is maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and still stands impressive with old apartments and tall pillars. Hari Parbat provides a top view of Makhdoom Sahib shrine."

              "reviewText": "The fort atop the hill was initially fortified by the Mughal emperor Akbar in 1590, though the current structure was completed in 1808 by Atta Mohammed Khan, a governor under the Durrani Empire.\nAccording to Hindu mythology, the hill was formed when Goddess Parvati, in the form of a bird, dropped a pebble on the demon Jaledbhava, which grew into the hill we see today. The site is sacred to Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs, featuring a temple, mosques, and a gurdwara.\nEntry to Hari Parbat is quite affordable, with a nominal fee of 725 for Indian citizens and 750 for foreigners. However, due to its strategic importance, the site is under the protection of the Indian Army. Visitors need to obtain special permission from them near the gate to enter the place.\nOne of the highlights of visiting Hari Parbat is the panoramic view of Srinagar it offers. From the top, you can see the sprawling city, the serene Dal Lake, and the surrounding mountains. It's a perfect spot for photography enthusiasts and nature lovers alike.\nHari Parbat is home to several significant religious sites. The Sharika Devi Temple, dedicated to Goddess Jagadamba, is a revered spot for Kashmiri Pandits. Additionally, there's a gurdwara, Gurdwara Chatti Patshahi, which marks the place where Guru Har Gobind, the sixth Sikh Guru, stayed during his travels. The presence of these diverse religious sites makes Hari Parbat a symbol of communal harmony."

Located on a hill overlooking Srinagar, Hari Parbat holds immense religious and cultural significance. The fort itself is believed to have been originally constructed by the Mughal emperor Akbar in the 16th century and later fortified by the Durrani rulers. Today, it stands as a proud symbol of Kashmir’s rich heritage.\n\nReaching the fort is quite easy — it’s about a 10-minute trek uphill, and the path is pleasant, surrounded by greenery and scenic backdrops. Once at the top, you are greeted by breathtaking panoramic views of Srinagar city, Dal Lake, and the majestic Zabarwan range. The fort area is clean, peaceful, and well-maintained, offering the perfect mix of nature and architecture.\n\nInside the fort complex, you’ll find the revered Kali Mata Mandir, where devotees come to offer prayers and seek blessings. Right nearby is the historic Gurudwara Chatti Patshahi Sahib, believed to have been visited by Guru Har Gobind Sahib Ji, the sixth Sikh Guru. The coexistence of faiths here adds to the spiritual richness of this place.\n\nThe atmosphere is serene and deeply spiritual. Whether you’re a history buff, a spiritual seeker, or simply a traveler in search of picturesque spots, Hari Parbat offers it all.\nA peaceful escape from the city with soulful energy and stunning views.\n\nHighly recommended for every visitor to Srinagar."

              "reviewText": "Hari Parbat, also known as Hari Parvat Fort or Hari Parbat Palace, is a historic fort and palace located in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, India. The fort was built in the 18th century by Atta Mohammad Khan, a governor of Kashmir during the Afghan rule. Later, it was renovated and expanded by the Dogra rulers. The palace offers stunning views of the surrounding landscape and houses a Gurudwara, a temple, and a masjid, showcasing the region's cultural diversity.\n\nI visited Hari Parbat Palace in peak summer, when the temperature soared to 35°C. Walking up the 150 steps was challenging, but the scenic views from the palace made it worthwhile. The viewpoints offered stunning vistas of Eid Gah, Tulip Garden, and other notable spots. Security was tight, but it was understandable given the need to ensure everyone's safety. The locals were allowed easily inside. They also confiscate the Government ID at the entrance and return it upin exit to keep a record of people returning and not camping there. While the palace's historical significance and architectural beauty are notable, the restrooms were disappointingly unclean. I would not recommend visiting the areas nearby the restrooms. Despite this, the palace's views and historical importance make it a worthwhile visit."

The garden is located at the northeast of the world famous Dal Lake.\n\nThe Bagh was built by Mughal Emperor Jahangir in 1619. The Bagh is considered the high point of Mughal horticulture. It is now a public park and also referred to as the \"Crown of Srinagar\".\n\nYeah, Mistri was wonderful with many groups of young people, couples, and families roaming throughout the gardens. Admission is ₹30 and there was no wait. There is also parking available. The water is not flowing in the sprinklers and streams and the central pavilion is in very poor condition. I was actually disappointed at that fact. However, the grounds are maintained pretty well maintained and there was no garbage to be found anywhere. Overall, definitely worth a visit as it’s pretty cool to see a 400+ year-old garden that has aspects of its original grandeur preserved."

It was built by the Mughal Emperor Jahangir for his wife, Nur Jahan, in the 17th century. The garden is renowned for its stunning layout, intricate water channels, and vibrant flowerbeds.\n\nThe design of Shalimar Bagh is based on the Persian Charbagh style, which symbolizes the four flowing rivers of paradise. The garden is divided into three terraces, each representing a different purpose: the first terrace is for public gatherings, the second for the royal family, and the third for the emperor and his court.\n\nOne of the most striking features of Shalimar Bagh is the central canal, which runs through the garden and is lined with polished stones that shimmer in the sunlight. The garden is also adorned with beautiful pavilions, fountains, and meticulously manicured lawns.\n\nVisitors to Shalimar Bagh can enjoy a peaceful stroll amidst the lush greenery, listen to the soothing sound of water flowing through the channels, and marvel at the exquisite craftsmanship of the Mughal era. The garden's serene ambiance and historical significance make it a popular tourist attraction and a must-visit destination for those exploring the rich cultural heritage of Kashmir."

Spread over 30 hectares at the foothills of the Zabarwan Range, and overlooking the iconic Dal Lake, this garden is the largest tulip garden in Asia. Every year, during the spring season from late March to mid-April, the garden bursts into a mesmerizing display of color as more than 1.5 million tulips bloom across the terraces. With over 60 varieties of tulips in all shades imaginable – red, yellow, pink, white, orange, and purple – the sight is nothing short of magical.\n\nEstablished in 2007, the garden was created to promote floriculture and tourism in the valley. Since then, it has become a must-visit destination, especially during the annual Tulip Festival, which features cultural performances, Kashmiri handicrafts, local cuisine, and folk music. Apart from tulips, the garden also features other flowers like hyacinths, daffodils, muscari, and ranunculi that enhance the beauty of the landscape."

The gardens primary appeal is it's combination of water basins and cascading water falls that flow from the back of the garden to the front entrance. We visited on a week day in July and the garden was full of tourists enjoying the gardens, along with many young children swimming in the water basins.

There is a big sign at the entrance to the mosque which clearly states this (see photo #34). I found this extremely disappointing and exclusionary.\n\nThe mosque is an example of Kashmiri wooden architecture, and is decorated with papier mache. The mosque structure is a Monument of National Importance.\n\nThe mosque is situated on the right bank of the river Jhelum between the Fateh Kadal and Zaina Kadal bridges and was built in 1395 CE u\nSent the command of Sultan Sikendar in memory of Mir Sayyid Ali Hamadani."

Details of this can be googled.\nThere are 240 odd steps. The last about 20 steps are about one foot high. Those who have arthritis or leg pain keep off. Instead you can do seva at the Langar at the start point.\nTry to reach early as possible as it gets crowded. The traffic is kind of unorganized hence gets messy. Autos are preferred mode to travel. Need to bargain hard with them.\nEmpty your bladder before as the toilets are very unclean.\nIt's at the highest point in Srinagar, therefore, it's under military.\nFor an average person it will take about 20 minutes.\nDon't miss visiting the cave where the Shankaracharya did meditation."

This ancient temple deserves every bit of its 5-star rating.\n\nPerched atop the Shankaracharya Hill, the temple holds immense importance for Hindus. It is believed to have been built around 200 BC by the revered philosopher and scholar, Adi Shankaracharya. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, one of the most revered deities in Hinduism, and serves as a prominent pilgrimage site for devotees.\n\nThe significance of the Shankaracharya Temple lies not only in its architectural splendor but also in its spiritual aura. As I climbed the stone steps leading to the temple, I couldn't help but feel a deep sense of reverence and connection to the divine. The panoramic views of Srinagar and the surrounding valley only added to the sanctity of the place.\n\nInside the temple, I was greeted by a beautiful idol of Lord Shiva, radiating an aura of tranquility and divinity. The priest shared insightful stories and teachings associated with the temple, deepening my understanding of Hindu traditions and beliefs.\n\nThe architectural style of the Shankaracharya Temple reflects the rich cultural heritage of Kashmir and showcases intricate carvings and craftsmanship. It stands as a testament to the devotion and artistry of the past.\n\nFor Hindus, a visit to the Shankaracharya Temple is not just a spiritual journey but a reaffirmation of their faith and connection to Lord Shiva. It is a place where devotees seek blessings, solace, and guidance.\n\nI highly recommend visiting the Shankaracharya Temple to anyone traveling to Srinagar, especially those interested in exploring Hindu spirituality and the cultural heritage of Kashmir.\n\nOverall, my experience at the Shankaracharya Temple was unforgettable. It left me with a profound sense of spirituality and a deeper appreciation for the significance of this sacred place in Hinduism. It is undoubtedly a must-visit destination in Srinagar."

The state and tourism department must promote this museum as a must visit place in Srinagar. I’d think knowing history of the region will help any tourist’s experience in the valley much more enjoyable.\n\nRight on the bank of Jhelum, this museum is huge, but lacks few basic amenities. When we arrived, there was a power cut, and there was no power backup. All the galleries were almost dark and we had use our own torchlight to visit the galleries.\n\nOur luck - just when we were about to leave, power was restored and we had the opportunity to visit the archeology section. This was one of the best archeology galleries of this country.\n\nThe documentation could be slightly better. The restrooms are barely usable. No coffee shop or museum shop.\n\nThey charge nominal fees for taking photo and video is each of the galleries."

The exhibits provide a detailed insight into various generations and their traditions, making it a must-visit for history enthusiasts. The entry ticket is very affordable at just ₹20. However, if you want to take photos, there’s an additional charge of ₹260, and for videos, it’s around ₹1000. Despite the extra cost for photography, the museum offers a valuable experience and is definitely worth a visit!"

Away from the hustle and bustle of Srinagar's main city, this spot is ideal for those who enjoy watching artifacts, old coins, and historical relics. However, I wish they maintained it a bit better. Many exhibits had their lights switched off, making it hard to read the descriptions. Perhaps it was due to an event and staff were occupied. Overall, a good place for history buffs. The taxidermy section was my favorite."

Hence the name of the road on which it's placed is Residency road. After the British left this was converted into Art and Handloom emporium by the government.\nThere is a misconception that the place would be expensive but surprisingly I found that the rates were very competitive with the local market and in some cases cheaper also. For instance paper machie and walnut wood carving was a bit cheaper, plus they have a huge range and on top of it they give a 10% discount!\nThe surrounding huge lawns are so beautiful by themselves with centuries old Chinar and Deodhar trees. During the flowering season they are full of colourful and fragrant flowers."

Every item is clearly labeled, quality-checked, and priced fairly as per government norms — which means no haggling, no inflated quotes, and complete peace of mind.\n\nThe staff was extremely courteous and helpful, patiently explaining the details and craftsmanship behind each product. Their honesty and professionalism made the entire shopping experience comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nAlso, a word of caution: many of the negative reviews online are completely fake, often posted by disgruntled local shop owners who don’t want tourists to buy from the emporium. They lose business when people choose a fixed-price, government-backed store that guarantees authenticity.\n\nEven cab drivers may try to divert you to private shops, claiming the government emporium is closed, expensive, or not worth it — but that’s only because they get a commission from those stores. Don’t fall for it.\n\nIf you do visit local shops (and you probably will out of curiosity), just be aware:\n•\tThey often quote 2 to 3 times the actual price — so start negotiating from 40% of the quoted amount.\n•\tBe extra cautious about “Tush” shawls — sellers often try to pass off non pashmina items as Tush, even though Tush wool is banned, and what you’re being sold is fake.\n\nIn contrast, the Srinagar Government Emporium guarantees authentic, fairly priced products, with no sales pressure and a calm, respectful atmosphere. It’s the best place to shop in Srinagar if you value quality, trust, and a hassle-free experience."

Built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar in the late 16th century, it is one of two main entrances to the fort, the other being Sangin Darwaza. Kathidarwaza is an architectural masterpiece, reflecting the grandeur of Mughal design with intricate stone carvings and a traditional Persian style.\n\nThe gate offers panoramic views of the surrounding landscape, including Dal Lake and the sprawling city of Srinagar. The Hari Parbat Fort, of which Kathidarwaza is a part, is a significant historical and cultural site, tied to both Mughal history and local Kashmiri legends.\n\nThe fort and its gateway hold great religious importance as well, being closely associated with the goddess Sharika, an incarnation of Durga, whose shrine lies within the fort complex."

Our driver, Riyaz bhai, was an absolute gem—genuine, helpful, and always ensuring our trip went smoothly. He introduced us to authentic Kashmiri restaurants and stores, adding a real local touch to our experience.\n\nThe hotels provided were not only beautiful and hygienic but also very conveniently located. The home-cooked breakfast and dinner were incredibly tasty and healthy, and the hotel staff were attentive to all our needs.\n\nThe houseboat stay was another highlight—absolutely luxurious and perfectly located. Grue Holidays also went the extra mile to arrange Gondola ride tickets for us during peak season when we couldn’t get them online. Though we had to pay a bit extra, it was totally worth it.\n\nThe itinerary was well-planned and allowed us to cover almost all major tourist spots without feeling rushed.\n\nOverall, I am extremely satisfied with the accommodation, food, transportation, and hospitality provided by Grue Holidays. We’re heading back home with hearts full of wonderful memories. Thank you, Grue Holidays, for such a beautiful trip!"

You have the whole house boat to yourself with a nice view (more peaceful than the street view on the main section of dal lake) and there’s meal options if you want. Has hot water and the owner is very friendly and super helpful along with his family. Had such a lovely stay 😊"

From the moment we arrived, their warmth and attentiveness set the tone for a delightful experience. The boathouse itself was a masterpiece, showcasing a blend of comfort and nautical charm. The owner's passion for ensuring guests' comfort was evident in every detail, from the well-appointed amenities to the personalized touches that made our stay truly special. If you're seeking a unique and hospitable retreat, this boathouse and its owner are unparalleled."

Recipes are not standard. Hygiene is poor. The ambience is pathetic. There's so much of a mess in the approach road to these motels. I will only recommend it if you are low on the budget and in a hurry to go for lunch. Because the service is almost instant. All these cuisines are OTC and ready to be served."
