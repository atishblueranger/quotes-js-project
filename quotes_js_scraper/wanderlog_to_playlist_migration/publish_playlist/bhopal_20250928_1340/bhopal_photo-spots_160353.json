The name itself - meaning \"Crown of Mosques\" - is a fitting tribute to this majestic structure that stands tall not just in scale, but in grace, serenity, and historical importance.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was its grandeur and tranquility. One of the largest mosques in India, it rises proudly with its pink façade, massive domes, and soaring minarets - a reminder of India's rich Islamic architectural heritage. The mosque isn't just a place of worship, it's a living monument that carries centuries of devotion, resilience, and artistry.\n\nWhat stood out most to me was the warmth and openness of the people. I was greeted with respect and curiosity. There was no barrier of faith - only shared reverence. It reminded me of the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, who emphasized \"Na koi Hindu, na Musalman\" - that at the root of all spiritual paths is one universal truth and Creator.\n\nWhether you're spiritual, a lover of history, or simply someone seeking peace - I wholeheartedly recommend a visit to Taj-ul-Masajid. It's not just a mosque - it's a celebration of faith, culture, and the diversity that defines India.",

            "text": "The construction of the Taj-ul-Masajid was started by Nawab Shah Jahan Begum of Bhopal, in the newly built walled suburb of Shahjahanabad. The exact year when construction was started is unclear; Sharma estimated it to be 1871. The Bhopal-based journalist and the author of Masajid-e-Bhopal (transl. The Mosques in Bhopal), Aarif Aziz stated the date as 1887.\n\nAfter Shah Jahan Begum died in 1901, the mosque continued to be built by her daughter, Sultan Jahan Begum, till the end of her lifetime. The structure was planned in the midst of three water bodies, namely: Munshi Hussain Talab; Noor Mahal Talab; and Motia Talab. Hamidullah Khan helped construct one gate of the mosque on the suggestions of Shah Jahan Begum.\n\nThe construction work was later on led by Islamic scholar Imran Khan Nadwi, whose brother Salman Khan Nadwi, supervised the constructions. The construction was complete by 1958 at an expenditure of 20 million Indian rupees. The entrance of the mosque was renovated with motifs from 13th century Syrian mosques donated by the Emir of Kuwait in memory of his late wife.\n\nThe Taj-ul-Masajid largely takes inspiration from Mughal architecture. The mosque has a pink facade topped by two 18-storey high octagonal minarets with marble domes, an impressive main hallway with attractive pillars, and marble flooring resembling the likes of Jama Masjid in Delhi and the Badshahi Mosque of Lahore. It has a courtyard with a large ablution tank in the centre. It has a double-storeyed gateway with four recessed archways and nine cusped multifold openings in the main prayer hall. The massive pillars in the hall hold 27 ceilings through squinted arches of which 16 ceilings are decorated with ornate petalled designs.\n\nThe mosque also features a zenana, rare given that prayer from home was the norm for women at the time of the mosque's construction.",

Spread across a vast, scenic campus on Shyamla Hills, overlooking the beautiful Upper Lake, this museum isn't just a collection of artifacts - it's a celebration of India's incredible tribal, rural, and cultural diversity.\n\nWhat sets this museum apart is its open-air layout. You don't just see history in glass cases - you walk through it. Life-size tribal huts, traditional dwellings, agricultural setups, and village scenes from different states and communities across India have been recreated with amazing authenticity. Each corner of the museum tells a story - from the art and rituals to the lifestyle and survival methods of our indigenous communities.\n\nThe indoor galleries are just as impressive, showcasing rare photographs, folk art, musical instruments, ornaments, masks, and even spiritual beliefs of different tribes. Everything is well-labeled and explained in both Hindi and English, making it easy to understand and connect with.\n\nIt's not just educational - it's a peaceful, soul-touching journey through India's roots. Walking through the lush green paths, hearing the birds, and soaking in the tribal wisdom makes this place feel sacred.\n\nThe staff is helpful, the premises are clean and well-maintained, and there's enough space for families to enjoy without crowds. I highly recommend this museum for students, researchers, history enthusiasts, photographers, and anyone who wants to experience the real India beyond textbooks.\n\nTake your time when you visit - you'll leave with a deeper appreciation for India's cultural richness and the resilience of its people. A true national treasure! 🇮🇳✨",

Can visit this place either by ropeway or through own vehicle. However, the 1 km approach road to the top and parking is quite congested. Grand View of Bhopal city and landing/ takeoff of aeroplanes from the nearby airport is quite pleasing. it's a good place for 1-2 hours trip.",
