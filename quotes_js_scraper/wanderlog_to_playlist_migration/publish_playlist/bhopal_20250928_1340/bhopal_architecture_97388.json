The name itself - meaning \"Crown of Mosques\" - is a fitting tribute to this majestic structure that stands tall not just in scale, but in grace, serenity, and historical importance.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was its grandeur and tranquility. One of the largest mosques in India, it rises proudly with its pink façade, massive domes, and soaring minarets - a reminder of India's rich Islamic architectural heritage. The mosque isn't just a place of worship, it's a living monument that carries centuries of devotion, resilience, and artistry.\n\nWhat stood out most to me was the warmth and openness of the people. I was greeted with respect and curiosity. There was no barrier of faith - only shared reverence. It reminded me of the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, who emphasized \"Na koi Hindu, na Musalman\" - that at the root of all spiritual paths is one universal truth and Creator.\n\nWhether you're spiritual, a lover of history, or simply someone seeking peace - I wholeheartedly recommend a visit to Taj-ul-Masajid. It's not just a mosque - it's a celebration of faith, culture, and the diversity that defines India.",

            "text": "The construction of the Taj-ul-Masajid was started by Nawab Shah Jahan Begum of Bhopal, in the newly built walled suburb of Shahjahanabad. The exact year when construction was started is unclear; Sharma estimated it to be 1871. The Bhopal-based journalist and the author of Masajid-e-Bhopal (transl. The Mosques in Bhopal), Aarif Aziz stated the date as 1887.\n\nAfter Shah Jahan Begum died in 1901, the mosque continued to be built by her daughter, Sultan Jahan Begum, till the end of her lifetime. The structure was planned in the midst of three water bodies, namely: Munshi Hussain Talab; Noor Mahal Talab; and Motia Talab. Hamidullah Khan helped construct one gate of the mosque on the suggestions of Shah Jahan Begum.\n\nThe construction work was later on led by Islamic scholar Imran Khan Nadwi, whose brother Salman Khan Nadwi, supervised the constructions. The construction was complete by 1958 at an expenditure of 20 million Indian rupees. The entrance of the mosque was renovated with motifs from 13th century Syrian mosques donated by the Emir of Kuwait in memory of his late wife.\n\nThe Taj-ul-Masajid largely takes inspiration from Mughal architecture. The mosque has a pink facade topped by two 18-storey high octagonal minarets with marble domes, an impressive main hallway with attractive pillars, and marble flooring resembling the likes of Jama Masjid in Delhi and the Badshahi Mosque of Lahore. It has a courtyard with a large ablution tank in the centre. It has a double-storeyed gateway with four recessed archways and nine cusped multifold openings in the main prayer hall. The massive pillars in the hall hold 27 ceilings through squinted arches of which 16 ceilings are decorated with ornate petalled designs.\n\nThe mosque also features a zenana, rare given that prayer from home was the norm for women at the time of the mosque's construction.",

Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the temple houses an awe-inspiring 7.5-foot high lingam in its sanctum - one of the tallest in India. The sheer scale and architectural brilliance are enough to leave anyone spellbound.\n\nBelieved to have been constructed in the 11th century during the reign of the Paramara king Bhoja, the temple stands as a powerful testament to the vision and craftsmanship of that era. Despite its unfinished state, the Bhojeshwar Temple remains spiritually enriching and historically significant.\n\nWhether you're a history lover, a devotee, or simply seeking peace in a scenic setting, this temple offers a unique and humbling experience. A must-visit gem in the heart of Madhya Pradesh!",

The construction was commissioned by Chote Khan, a minister of Nawab Hayat Muhammad Khan Bahadur.A number of earlier wells were merged in this lake. The lower lake is beside a bridge named 'Pul Pukhta'. The lower lake has also been mentioned as \"Pukhta-Pul Talao\" in literature.\nThe Lower Lake suffers from pollution due to drainage from sewage-filled nullahs, lack of fresh water source and commercial washing of clothes.

Since now the palace is being converted to a heritage hotel so the caretaker does not allow anybody inside the palace. There are cctv cameras all around outside just to keep a watch that no one enters into the palace. The property now has become a private property. The architecture elements of Islamic architecture is well portrayed in this building. Great was the vision of our historical rulers and their infinite knowledge and also the highness of the craftsmanship at that time period.

It was very challenging since the existing layout was not fit for an office. To our disadvantage the client did kot give us enough freedom to break down existing walls and some fixtures to save on the cost.\nBut still, to our delight and surprise K Atelier managed to come up with so many creative ways to match the design intent with the least of demolition activity. We still were hesitant about the end result considering the control factors and boundations set by the client.\n\nBut as it approached the last stages of interiors the unfolding of the final look and feel was quite astounding not just to us but the client as well. The blending of interiors, colors, fixtures, furniture and especially the lighting was very soothing and carried a rich modern look. Part of it was a high-tech quality lab and a sample room which also merged with the theme with ease.\nA good design is not only how it looks but also how it functions, which could be experienced walking in this new office facility and exploring its features.\nWe would love to work with this firm again in the future and would strongly recommend their services, not only based on the result but also how smooth and professional their approach has been to work with!\nAll the best wishes to the Founder and the team!",
