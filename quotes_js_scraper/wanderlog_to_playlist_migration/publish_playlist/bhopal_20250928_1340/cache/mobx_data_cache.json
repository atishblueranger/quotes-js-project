Being hilly area houses are constructed in two floors. People prefer basements.  Multi storied Apartments are also there, but one need to have a motor driven vehicle to reach there and climb back to the Jail Road. Overall the visit was enjoying."

The name itself — meaning \"Crown of Mosques\" — is a fitting tribute to this majestic structure that stands tall not just in scale, but in grace, serenity, and historical importance.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was its grandeur and tranquility. One of the largest mosques in India, it rises proudly with its pink façade, massive domes, and soaring minarets — a reminder of India's rich Islamic architectural heritage. The mosque isn't just a place of worship, it's a living monument that carries centuries of devotion, resilience, and artistry.\n\nWhat stood out most to me was the warmth and openness of the people. I was greeted with respect and curiosity. There was no barrier of faith — only shared reverence. It reminded me of the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, who emphasized \"Na koi Hindu, na Musalman\" — that at the root of all spiritual paths is one universal truth and Creator.\n\nWhether you're spiritual, a lover of history, or simply someone seeking peace — I wholeheartedly recommend a visit to Taj-ul-Masajid. It's not just a mosque — it's a celebration of faith, culture, and the diversity that defines India."

              "reviewText": "The construction of the Taj-ul-Masajid was started by Nawab Shah Jahan Begum of Bhopal, in the newly built walled suburb of Shahjahanabad. The exact year when construction was started is unclear; Sharma estimated it to be 1871. The Bhopal-based journalist and the author of Masajid-e-Bhopal (transl. The Mosques in Bhopal), Aarif Aziz stated the date as 1887.\n\nAfter Shah Jahan Begum died in 1901, the mosque continued to be built by her daughter, Sultan Jahan Begum, till the end of her lifetime. The structure was planned in the midst of three water bodies, namely: Munshi Hussain Talab; Noor Mahal Talab; and Motia Talab. Hamidullah Khan helped construct one gate of the mosque on the suggestions of Shah Jahan Begum.\n\nThe construction work was later on led by Islamic scholar Imran Khan Nadwi, whose brother Salman Khan Nadwi, supervised the constructions. The construction was complete by 1958 at an expenditure of 20 million Indian rupees. The entrance of the mosque was renovated with motifs from 13th century Syrian mosques donated by the Emir of Kuwait in memory of his late wife.\n\nThe Taj-ul-Masajid largely takes inspiration from Mughal architecture. The mosque has a pink facade topped by two 18-storey high octagonal minarets with marble domes, an impressive main hallway with attractive pillars, and marble flooring resembling the likes of Jama Masjid in Delhi and the Badshahi Mosque of Lahore. It has a courtyard with a large ablution tank in the centre. It has a double-storeyed gateway with four recessed archways and nine cusped multifold openings in the main prayer hall. The massive pillars in the hall hold 27 ceilings through squinted arches of which 16 ceilings are decorated with ornate petalled designs.\n\nThe mosque also features a zenana, rare given that prayer from home was the norm for women at the time of the mosque's construction."

It is big, and when I visited, I saw many Jamaats means gathering or we  an say gathering of people who travel from one place to another to seek knowledge and spread messages of Islam among the community. It is quite a quiet place but always busy with people offering Namaz or just Jamatis sitting there. It is one of the landmarks in Bhopal and must be visited during the Bhopal trip."

Good for photos and a quick visit, but don’t expect real tribal atmosphere or original artifacts."

This place would help them experience our village culture.\nWould love to go again .\n\nPros: 1. Ticket charges is Ra. 10 per person plus Ra. 100 for mobile or camera photography.\n2. It is full AC, so summer time won't feel heavy.\n3. All architectures have been made with love\n\nCons: 1. Toilet and area surrounding it was stinking badly.\n2.

              "reviewText": "The Lower Lake is located to the east of the Upper Lake. An earthen dam separates the two lakes. The two lakes are built in a terraced manner, the lowest level of the Upper Lake is just below the highest level of the Lower Lake.\n\nThe Lower Lake has an area (water spread) of 1.29 , and its catchment area is 9.6 km2. The lake receives subsurface seepage from the Upper Lake. In the 1850s, the maximum and minimum depths of the lake were 11.7 m and 6.16 m respectively. As of 2011, the maximum depth was 10.7m.\n\nThe Lower Lake does not have any fresh water source; it receives seepage water from the Upper Lake and drainage from 28 sewage-filled nullahs. It drains into the Patra rivulet, which joins Halali River, a small tributary of the Betwa River.\nThe lake was built by creating in 1794 to beautify the city. The construction was commissioned by Chote Khan, a minister of Nawab Hayat Muhammad Khan Bahadur.A number of earlier wells were merged in this lake. The lower lake is beside a bridge named 'Pul Pukhta'. The lower lake has also been mentioned as \"Pukhta-Pul Talao\" in literature.\nThe Lower Lake suffers from pollution due to drainage from sewage-filled nullahs, lack of fresh water source and commercial washing of clothes. The entire lake is eutrophic, and its water is not suitable for drinking.\n\nHad a good and peaceful mindset."

              "reviewText": "Bhopal is home to a number of mosques, including the Moti Masjid. The Moti Masjid may be smaller than some of the other magnificent and historically significant structures in the ‘city of mosques,’ but its significance cannot be understated. It was constructed in 1860 by Sikander Jehan Begum, a descendant of Qudusiya Begum of Bhopal, and is one of India’s best-known historical landmarks.\n\nThis mosque in Bhopal looks a lot like Delhi’s Jama Masjid, except for one thing: it’s smaller. Two modest cupolas adorn the Moti Masjid’s white marble exterior. On each side of the main building are two stunning and interesting dark-red tower."

Perched majestically on top of the Arera Hills, the temple is a beacon of serenity that stands tall against the city's skyline. The moment you begin the ascent towards the temple, you can feel a shift in the atmosphere, a quiet calm that prepares you for the tranquility that awaits.\n\nThe temple itself is a masterpiece of architecture. The beautiful sandstone and marble structure glows with a soft, warm light, creating a visually stunning sight against the backdrop of the sky. The craftsmanship is evident in every corner, from the gracefully carved pillars to the magnificent spire that reaches upwards. It is a place that is clearly maintained with a great deal of love and care. The entire complex is spotlessly clean, which adds immensely to the sacred and pristine feeling of the environment.\n\nWalking into the main temple area, I was greeted by the beautiful idols of Goddess Lakshmi and Lord Vishnu. The spiritual energy within the sanctum is palpable, yet gentle and welcoming. It is not a crowded or overwhelming place, but rather a space where you can sit quietly, reflect, and feel a deep connection to the divine. The surrounding gardens are just as lovely, with manicured lawns and beautiful flowers that make for a pleasant stroll.\n\nOne of the most breathtaking aspects of visiting Birla Mandir is the panoramic view it offers of Bhopal. From this vantage point, you can see the entire city spread out below you, with the shimmering lakes creating a picturesque landscape. I spent a long time just soaking in this incredible view, feeling completely detached from the hustle and bustle of daily life. It is a view that truly soothes the soul.\n\nThe complex also houses the Birla Museum, which was an unexpected and delightful bonus. It contains a fascinating collection of sculptures and artifacts that offer a glimpse into the region's rich history. It adds another layer to the visit, combining spirituality with art and culture.\n\nMy time at Birla Mandir was a highlight of my trip to Bhopal. It is more than just a place of worship, it is a sanctuary of peace, a marvel of architecture, and a viewpoint that offers the most spectacular vistas of the city. I left feeling refreshed, spiritually uplifted, and with a lasting impression of its serene beauty. I would wholeheartedly recommend a visit to anyone traveling to Bhopal. It is an experience that will stay with you long after you have left."

Spread across a vast, scenic campus on Shyamla Hills, overlooking the beautiful Upper Lake, this museum isn’t just a collection of artifacts — it’s a celebration of India’s incredible tribal, rural, and cultural diversity.\n\nWhat sets this museum apart is its open-air layout. You don’t just see history in glass cases — you walk through it. Life-size tribal huts, traditional dwellings, agricultural setups, and village scenes from different states and communities across India have been recreated with amazing authenticity. Each corner of the museum tells a story — from the art and rituals to the lifestyle and survival methods of our indigenous communities.\n\nThe indoor galleries are just as impressive, showcasing rare photographs, folk art, musical instruments, ornaments, masks, and even spiritual beliefs of different tribes. Everything is well-labeled and explained in both Hindi and English, making it easy to understand and connect with.\n\nIt’s not just educational — it’s a peaceful, soul-touching journey through India’s roots. Walking through the lush green paths, hearing the birds, and soaking in the tribal wisdom makes this place feel sacred.\n\nThe staff is helpful, the premises are clean and well-maintained, and there’s enough space for families to enjoy without crowds. I highly recommend this museum for students, researchers, history enthusiasts, photographers, and anyone who wants to experience the real India beyond textbooks.\n\nTake your time when you visit — you’ll leave with a deeper appreciation for India’s cultural richness and the resilience of its people. A true national treasure! 🇮🇳✨"

There are many places for children to play here. You will also find the Taj Mahal here. You will also find the Red Fort here. You will also find the Taj Hotel here.And this place is more famous for children. You will get good food here. You will also find good places to visit here.\nI am a solo traveler. I just wanted to go here and see how this place is because I saw reviews on Google. There were a lot of positive reviews about it so I just wanted to come here for a visit. To be honest, its entry fee is ₹60. I can say that yes it is worth it for one time.\n\nThis place is not for repeated visits. This place is for one-time visits only. If you have children at home or you want to spend more time with your family, then you can come here again and again. You can come in the evening. You can enjoy comfortably and then leave. Otherwise, if you are a serious traveler, then it is okay for you to visit this place only once."

The standout feature is the collection of life-size replicas of world-famous monuments like the Taj Mahal, Eiffel Tower, and Statue of Liberty, offering great photo opportunities and a mini world tour experience.\n\nThe mall also houses a water park with attractions such as a swimming pool, wave pool, and various water rides, making it a fun spot for families. Additionally, there’s a multiplex cinema, gaming zones, and a variety of food outlets to cater to different tastes. ￼\n\nHowever, some areas could benefit from better maintenance. Visitors have noted issues like cleanliness in restrooms and the need for more active retail outlets. Despite these, the overall experience remains enjoyable, especially for those looking to spend a day exploring diverse attractions in one place.\n\nTip: Visit during the evening to see the monument replicas beautifully illuminated."

The place felt quite dingy and lacked basic hygiene. The food court was poorly maintained. I didn’t feel comfortable eating there and the washrooms were in terrible condition. Overall, I would not recommend visiting this mall. If you have time to spare in Bhopal, you're better off visiting the lake area instead."

The park offers a fantastic mix of water and amusement rides that cater to all ages, making it a great destination for both families and groups of friends.\nThe water park is a highlight, with thrilling slides and a lively rain dance area that kept everyone entertained for hours. The water quality was good, and the changing rooms were clean and well-maintained. The amusement park also has plenty to offer, from exciting thrill rides to more relaxed attractions.\nThe overall atmosphere is vibrant and fun, and the staff were friendly and attentive. We found the food court to be a convenient and tasty option for a quick bite. It's a well-managed park that prioritizes fun and safety. If you're in the area and looking for an amazing day out, I highly recommend Kanha Fun City.\""

The interface (or layout/setup) is intuitive, navigation is straightforward, and there’s minimal friction in achieving what you're trying to do. Even as someone who is not extremely tech-savvy (or experienced), I felt comfortable throughout.\n\nValue for Money:\nThis product/service offers great value. It balances quality and cost well, and it doesn’t feel like you’re compromising. For what you’re getting, the price seems fair and well-justified. There are pricier alternatives out there, but this option proves that excellence doesn't always have to break the bank.\n\nSupport & Communication:\nAny time I had questions or encountered issues, the support was timely, helpful, and respectful. It’s rare to find such a responsive and human customer support team these days. They genuinely care about the user experience and go above and beyond to ensure satisfaction.\n\nImprovements & Suggestions:\nNo product is without room for improvement. I would suggest minor tweaks or enhancements here and there (such as [insert personalized comment here]). These changes could elevate it from great to perfect.\n\nOverall Verdict:\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this to others. It’s a well-rounded, high-quality, and thoughtful creation that delivers on its promises. Whether you’re using it for personal, professional, or recreational reasons, it offers something valuable."

Since now the palace is being converted to a heritage hotel so the caretaker does not allow anybody inside the palace. There are cctv cameras all around outside just to keep a watch that no one enters into the palace. The property now has become a private property. The architecture elements of Islamic architecture is well portrayed in this building. Great was the vision of our historical rulers and their infinite knowledge and also the highness of the craftsmanship at that time period. Apart from Taj Mahal in Agra this is another Taj Mahal which is in Bhopal."

Located in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, it has suffered neglect over the years, with parts in ruins despite efforts for restoration. Once a symbol of regal opulence, it now stands as a reminder of fading heritage, needing urgent conservation. Recently it has been taken over by hotel company to build a heritage hotel"

              "reviewText": "The Taj Mahal at Bhopal was built as the Begum's residence, at a cost of ₹ 3,000,000. Its construction spanned over a period of 13 years, from 1871 to 1884.[1] It was one of the largest palaces of the world built at that time.\n\nThe building was originally named Raj Mahal (\"royal palace\"). The British Resident at Bhopal, highly impressed with the architecture, suggested that the palace be renamed the Taj Mahal, the Taj Mahal at Agra having been built by the Begum's namesake Shah Jahan. The begum accepted the suggestion and the palace was renamed to Taj Mahal.[3] The Begum is said to have ordered a three-year-long celebration called Jashn-e-Taj Mahal after the completion of the building.\n\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, Nawab Hamidullah Khan allowed Sindhi refugees to stay in the palace. They stayed in Taj Mahal for around 4 years, before shifting to Bairagarh. The palace suffered some damage during this period.[1] After India's independence, some members of the royal family of Bhopal stayed at the palace, but gradually moved away, as they had no money for the repairs. By 2008, large parts of the palace complex had collapsed.\n\nThe palace was declared a state heritage monument by the Government of Madhya Pradesh in 2005 and the state archaeology department carried out restoration in parts. However, it was de-notified in 2011. Until 2013, the Taj Mahal was under the archives department. In 2014 the monument was handled over to the Madhya Pradesh tourism department.[4]\n\nIn 2017, a private builder from Indore, was handed over the property on lease to develop the sprawling 19th century structure into a 120-room heritage hotel. As of 2023 the work is yet to be started.\n\nsource Refreshing Bhopal ❤️"

The name itself — meaning \"Crown of Mosques\" — is a fitting tribute to this majestic structure that stands tall not just in scale, but in grace, serenity, and historical importance.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was its grandeur and tranquility. One of the largest mosques in India, it rises proudly with its pink façade, massive domes, and soaring minarets — a reminder of India's rich Islamic architectural heritage. The mosque isn't just a place of worship, it's a living monument that carries centuries of devotion, resilience, and artistry.\n\nWhat stood out most to me was the warmth and openness of the people. I was greeted with respect and curiosity. There was no barrier of faith — only shared reverence. It reminded me of the teachings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, who emphasized \"Na koi Hindu, na Musalman\" — that at the root of all spiritual paths is one universal truth and Creator.\n\nWhether you're spiritual, a lover of history, or simply someone seeking peace — I wholeheartedly recommend a visit to Taj-ul-Masajid. It's not just a mosque — it's a celebration of faith, culture, and the diversity that defines India."

              "reviewText": "The construction of the Taj-ul-Masajid was started by Nawab Shah Jahan Begum of Bhopal, in the newly built walled suburb of Shahjahanabad. The exact year when construction was started is unclear; Sharma estimated it to be 1871. The Bhopal-based journalist and the author of Masajid-e-Bhopal (transl. The Mosques in Bhopal), Aarif Aziz stated the date as 1887.\n\nAfter Shah Jahan Begum died in 1901, the mosque continued to be built by her daughter, Sultan Jahan Begum, till the end of her lifetime. The structure was planned in the midst of three water bodies, namely: Munshi Hussain Talab; Noor Mahal Talab; and Motia Talab. Hamidullah Khan helped construct one gate of the mosque on the suggestions of Shah Jahan Begum.\n\nThe construction work was later on led by Islamic scholar Imran Khan Nadwi, whose brother Salman Khan Nadwi, supervised the constructions. The construction was complete by 1958 at an expenditure of 20 million Indian rupees. The entrance of the mosque was renovated with motifs from 13th century Syrian mosques donated by the Emir of Kuwait in memory of his late wife.\n\nThe Taj-ul-Masajid largely takes inspiration from Mughal architecture. The mosque has a pink facade topped by two 18-storey high octagonal minarets with marble domes, an impressive main hallway with attractive pillars, and marble flooring resembling the likes of Jama Masjid in Delhi and the Badshahi Mosque of Lahore. It has a courtyard with a large ablution tank in the centre. It has a double-storeyed gateway with four recessed archways and nine cusped multifold openings in the main prayer hall. The massive pillars in the hall hold 27 ceilings through squinted arches of which 16 ceilings are decorated with ornate petalled designs.\n\nThe mosque also features a zenana, rare given that prayer from home was the norm for women at the time of the mosque's construction."

It may be historical, but the location has been lost, and it is home of many people.  It is not a place to visit, and you will be disappointed if you do. Instead, there are two MAhals nearby, one of which is under renovation, and the other is GOUHAR MAHAL. Its infrastructure has been dismantled and is no longer maintained by anyone. It feels more like a home than a Mahal or an old house. I was very disappointed to put this on my list of places to visit. As a result, it is not necessary to pay a visit."

The sheer scale and architectural brilliance are enough to leave anyone spellbound.\n\nBelieved to have been constructed in the 11th century during the reign of the Paramara king Bhoja, the temple stands as a powerful testament to the vision and craftsmanship of that era. Despite its unfinished state, the Bhojeshwar Temple remains spiritually enriching and historically significant.\n\nWhether you're a history lover, a devotee, or simply seeking peace in a scenic setting, this temple offers a unique and humbling experience. A must-visit gem in the heart of Madhya Pradesh!"

It was commissioned by the legendary King Bhoja of the Paramara dynasty.\nKey Highlights:\nMassive Shiva Linga: The temple houses one of the largest Shiva Lingas in India — about 7.5 feet high and 17.8 feet in circumference, carved from a single rock.\nUnique Architecture: Though incomplete, the temple displays impressive stonework, with huge sandstone blocks and finely carved pillars.\nUnfinished Structure: Construction seems to have stopped suddenly, and the reasons remain unknown. Nearby quarries and unfinished carvings offer clues to the ancient building techniques.\nSacred and Scenic: Set on a hilltop overlooking the Betwa River, the site is both spiritually significant and scenically beautiful."

As a token of honour, his statue is also established in the lake. Apart from rich history, this lake is also an important water body not only for the residents of Bhopal for whom this is a water reservoir, but also ecologically for the environment due to which it has been included in the Ramsar list of Wetlands.

It is so desgined that the eastern winds coming will be cooled by the three lakes (teen seedhi talab) and the air entering the palace will always be cooler. It is an architectural and engineering beauty. At present it is not well maintained. In the nawab era Benazeer palace was also used as the royal guest house. In 1929 Mahatma Gandhi stayed in this palace and a meeting was held here for freedom of India from britishers."

              "reviewText": "(Translated by Google) Built in 1877 by Nawab Shahjahan Begum, who was as great a builder as her namesake, the Mughal emperor Shahjahan, the palace was designed as a pleasure pavilion. Opposite Motiva Talia, one of three spring-fed lakes that were created at the same time to collect runoff from the neighboring Idaho hills, Benazir Palace is now over 130 years old and, by all accounts, was rebuilt about thirty years ago Should have been treated as heritage property. But, no, it was never considered as a heritage property and very strangely it was in the possession of the local medical college. How it came into the possession of the college, which is only 57 years old, baffles everyone. Worse, the college, exercising its property rights, leased it to NCC, which in turn, reportedly leased it to Prakash Jha's film company for a sum of Rs 5 lakh. It is a strange case of a lessee sub-leasing his rights over a property which is essentially public property. Apparently, the district administration was aware of this transaction, as Prakash Jha was given permission to shoot in the Palace premises by the local District Collector.\n\nIt was only when the media and Bhopal Nagarik Manch created an uproar in this matter that the government realized the mistake. The medical college had no idea that what it had was a heritage property. It seems that he had no hesitation in selling Benazir Maidan to NCC for a nominal sum as he was engaged in construction work at a nearby site. When Prakash Jha arrived, the tenant must have thought it was a God-given opportunity to earn some money. Thankfully, after a major discussion in The Times of India, all the irregularities in the handling of the case were removed. The government granted additional time to prepare a notification designating the palace as a \"protected monument\". A small delegation of Bhopal Nagarik Manch got the opportunity to see it while meeting the Archaeological Commissioner. Notification would have been issued by now.\n\nIt is not just Benazir Palace where the state government has failed to protect Bhopal's heritage structures. Over the years, many such structures, including several gates of the former walled city of Shahjahanabad, have been allowed to be occupied by unauthorized people. Worse, the Taj Mahal Palace, which was lovingly built by Shahjahan Begum and which later earned praise from the British high and mighty, was most unwisely used as a refuge for migrants after independence from Pakistan. Permission was given. This one thoughtless act of the then provincial government almost destroyed the palace. Similarly, the Gol Ghar, which was once an aviary for the Begum and has now been mercifully restored and renovated, was also handed over to the police one after another, without taking care of it. The case of Benazir Palace is no different. It was allowed to be used as a college. Due to a fire in its laboratory, some parts of it were badly damaged.\n\nAccording to the report, it is not clear who owns the palace. However, now that the Archaeological Department is going to take it under its control, it is expected that it will be taken better care of. The Archaeological Commissioner has assured Citizen Forum that Prakash Jha's film will also be shot in the palace complex under the supervision of experts (possibly archaeologists).\n\nMaintenance of heritage properties in Madhya Pradesh has gone haywire because the state government has not yet formed heritage conservation committees in many cities and towns. Such committees should be formed under the rules for conservation of heritage sites, buildings etc. In the absence of such committees, many heritage sites of historical and cultural importance have been lost due to lack of identity and identity. It's not too late yet; Perhaps even now the culture department can initiate this process and form such committees at least for those cities where many heritage structures and sites are located in or around them.\nMahatma Gandhi addressed a rally here in 1929.\n\n(Original)\n1877 में नवाब शाहजहां बेगम द्वारा निर्मित, जो अपने नाम के मुगल सम्राट शाहजहां की तरह ही एक महान निर्माता थीं, महल को एक आनंद मंडप के रूप में बनाया गया था। मोटिवा तालिया के सामने, तीन झरनों वाली झीलों में से एक, जिसे पड़ोसी इदाहो पहाड़ियों से अपवाह इकट्ठा करने के लिए उसी समय बनाया गया था, बेनजीर पैलेस अब 130 साल से अधिक पुराना है और सभी के हिसाब से, लगभग तीस साल पहले इसे एक विरासत संपत्ति के रूप में माना जाना चाहिए था। लेकिन, नहीं, इसे कभी भी एक विरासत संपत्ति के रूप में नहीं माना गया और बहुत ही अजीब बात यह है कि यह स्थानीय मेडिकल कॉलेज के कब्जे में था। यह कॉलेज के कब्जे में कैसे चला गया, जो केवल 57 साल पुराना है, यह सभी को हैरान करता है। इससे भी बदतर, कॉलेज ने अपने संपत्ति अधिकारों का प्रयोग करते हुए इसे एनसीसी को पट्टे पर दे दिया, जिसने बदले में, कथित तौर पर 5 लाख रुपये की राशि में प्रकाश झा की फिल्म कंपनी को पट्टे पर दे दिया। यह एक अजीब मामला है कि एक पट्टेदार ने एक ऐसी संपत्ति पर अपने अधिकारों को उप-पट्टे पर दिया जो अनिवार्य रूप से सार्वजनिक संपत्ति है। जाहिर है, जिला प्रशासन को इस लेन-देन की जानकारी थी, क्योंकि प्रकाश झा को पैलेस परिसर में शूटिंग करने की अनुमति स्थानीय जिला कलेक्टर द्वारा दी गई थी।\n\nमीडिया और भोपाल नागरिक मंच ने जब इस मामले में हंगामा मचाया, तब जाकर सरकार को इस गड़बड़ी का अहसास हुआ। मेडिकल कॉलेज को इस बात का अंदाजा ही नहीं था कि उसके पास जो कुछ है, वह एक हेरिटेज संपत्ति है। ऐसा लगता है कि उसे बेनजीर मैदान को एनसीसी को मामूली रकम में बेचने में कोई हिचक नहीं थी, क्योंकि वह पास की एक जगह पर निर्माण कार्य में लगा हुआ था। जब प्रकाश झा आए, तो पट्टेदार को यह कुछ पैसे कमाने का एक ईश्वर-प्रदत्त अवसर लगा होगा। शुक्र है कि टाइम्स ऑफ इंडिया में बड़ी चर्चा के बाद मामले से निपटने में सभी अनियमितताएं दूर हो गईं। सरकार ने महल को \"संरक्षित स्मारक\" के रूप में दर्शाने वाली अधिसूचना तैयार करने के लिए अतिरिक्त समय दिया। भोपाल नागरिक मंच के एक छोटे प्रतिनिधिमंडल को पुरातत्व आयुक्त से मिलने के दौरान इसे देखने का अवसर मिला। अब तक अधिसूचना जारी हो गई होगी।\n\nयह केवल बेनजीर पैलेस ही नहीं है, जहां राज्य सरकार भोपाल की विरासत संरचनाओं की सुरक्षा में विफल रही है। पिछले कुछ वर्षों में शाहजहांनाबाद के पूर्व चारदीवारी शहर के कई द्वारों सहित कई ऐसी संरचनाओं पर अनधिकृत लोगों को कब्जा करने की अनुमति दी गई। इससे भी बदतर, ताज महल पैलेस, जिसे शाहजहां बेगम ने बड़े प्यार से बनवाया था और जिसने बाद में ब्रिटिश उच्च और शक्तिशाली लोगों से प्रशंसा अर्जित की, को सबसे बड़ी नासमझी से पाकिस्तान से स्वतंत्रता के बाद प्रवासियों के लिए शरण के रूप में इस्तेमाल करने की अनुमति दी गई। तत्कालीन प्रांत की सरकार के इस एक विचारहीन कार्य ने महल को लगभग नष्ट कर दिया। इसी तरह, गोल घर, जो कभी बेगम के लिए एक पक्षीशाला था और जिसे अब दयापूर्वक बहाल और पुनर्निर्मित किया गया है, को भी एक के बाद एक पुलिस को सौंप दिया गया, बिना इसकी देखभाल किए। बेनजीर पैलेस का मामला अलग नहीं है। इसे एक कॉलेज के रूप में उपयोग करने की अनुमति दी गई थी। इसकी प्रयोगशाला में आग लगने से इसके कुछ हिस्से बुरी तरह क्षतिग्रस्त हो गए।\n\nरिपोर्ट के अनुसार, यह स्पष्ट नहीं है कि महल का मालिक कौन है। हालाँकि, अब जब पुरातत्व विभाग इसे अपने अधीन करने जा रहा है, तो उम्मीद है कि इसकी बेहतर देखभाल की जाएगी। पुरातत्व आयुक्त ने नागरिक मंच को आश्वासन दिया है कि प्रकाश झा की फिल्म भी महल परिसर में विशेषज्ञों की देखरेख (संभवतः पुरातत्वविदों की) में शूट की जाएगी।\n\nमध्य प्रदेश में विरासत संपत्तियों के रख-रखाव में गड़बड़ी इसलिए हुई है क्योंकि राज्य सरकार ने अब तक कई शहरों और कस्बों में विरासत संरक्षण समितियां नहीं बनाई हैं। विरासत स्थलों, इमारतों आदि के संरक्षण के नियमों के तहत ऐसी समितियों का गठन किया जाना चाहिए। ऐसी समितियों के अभाव में न जाने कितने ऐतिहासिक और सांस्कृतिक महत्व के विरासत स्थल अपनी पहचान और पहचान के अभाव में खो गए हैं। अभी भी बहुत देर नहीं हुई है; शायद अब भी संस्कृति विभाग इस प्रक्रिया को शुरू कर सकता है और कम से कम उन शहरों के लिए ऐसी समितियों का गठन कर सकता है, जहां या उनके आसपास कई विरासत संरचनाएं और स्थल स्थित हैं।\nमहात्मा गांधी ने 1929 में यहाँ एक रैली को संबोधित किया था।"

Being a non Muslim, I was not sure whether I could enter or not, so I asked an elderly gentleman who was exuding the mosque. He said I could go in & escorted me in himself.\n\nThe mosque was brilliantly lit from outside. I did i was the only visor & had the whole mosque to sit in tranquility or peace. I took a few moments to disk in the atmosphere of the place.\n\nI would say this is among the more beautiful mosques in India & well maintained."

The Begums ruled Bhopal and shows how women had the power to rule and build something which stands till today. The Begum were very wise. Their knowledge on Islamic architecture is well portrayed in the elements of the entire building. The place is mostly deserted apart from tourists travelling there. I request others to upload the correct pictures of the Masjid as few people have Added Taj ul Masajid pictures. Beware of the wrong pictures. I am sharing few pictures when i visited there."

The two lakes are built in a terraced manner, the lowest level of the Upper Lake is just below the highest level of the Lower Lake.\n\nThe Lower Lake has an area (water spread) of 1.29 , and its catchment area is 9.6 km2. The lake receives subsurface seepage from the Upper Lake. In the 1850s, the maximum and minimum depths of the lake were 11.7 m and 6.16 m respectively. As of 2011, the maximum depth was 10.7m.\n\nThe Lower Lake does not have any fresh water source; it receives seepage water from the Upper Lake and drainage from 28 sewage-filled nullahs. It drains into the Patra rivulet, which joins Halali River, a small tributary of the Betwa River.\nThe lake was built by creating in 1794 to beautify the city. The construction was commissioned by Chote Khan, a minister of Nawab Hayat Muhammad Khan Bahadur.A number of earlier wells were merged in this lake. The lower lake is beside a bridge named 'Pul Pukhta'. The lower lake has also been mentioned as \"Pukhta-Pul Talao\" in literature.\nThe Lower Lake suffers from pollution due to drainage from sewage-filled nullahs, lack of fresh water source and commercial washing of clothes. The entire lake is eutrophic, and its water is not suitable for drinking.\n\nHad a good and peaceful mindset."

It is interesting how the building has almost no elevation from the entry road, preserving the beautiful views of the lake behind.\nThe place is rich with spaces like a permanent museum, a tribal art gallery, indoor and an outdoor auditorium, a library along with graphic or the lithography studio with both indoor and outdoor spaces.\nYou've got to be very lucky to be able to see it all in one visit. I visited it twice and was fortunate enough have an opportunity to meet one of the very senior artists there and get his insights on the Antarang (the auditorium), its design and evolution over time."

It was very challenging since the existing layout was not fit for an office. To our disadvantage the client did kot give us enough freedom to break down existing walls and some fixtures to save on the cost.\nBut still, to our delight and surprise K Atelier managed to come up with so many creative ways to match the design intent with the least of demolition activity. We still were hesitant about the end result considering the control factors and boundations set by the client.\n\nBut as it approached the last stages of interiors the unfolding of the final look and feel was quite astounding not just to us but the client as well. The blending of interiors, colors, fixtures, furniture and especially the lighting was very soothing and carried a rich modern look. Part of it was a high-tech quality lab and a sample room which also merged with the theme with ease.\nA good design is not only how it looks but also how it functions, which could be experienced walking in this new office facility and exploring its features.\nWe would love to work with this firm again in the future and would strongly recommend their services, not only based on the result but also how smooth and professional their approach has been to work with!\nAll the best wishes to the Founder and the team!"

A big differentiator vs conventional interior designers  is a more refined design , a more global orientation on fit/finish , color palettes & a skilled execution team - thus making it a delightful experience for us.\n\nKulveer and his team of young architects/ designers were extremely responsive throughout the project, their creativity coupled with utmost professionalism, responsibility and integrity reflects in the beautiful home they've build for us.  I was super impressed with their attention to detail and best was they was incredibly patient with me, making various tweaks, showing me a ton of different options, and super willing to find alternatives that were more in our price range.\n\nKulveer brings a lot of individual passion to the project infusing it with the life that every dream home needs !!\n\nThanks to him, we get great compliments for our home and look forward to working with him again!!"

But if you know the history behind it, you will find its value. It's the house of Rani Kamlapati and her son after her husband Nizam Shaw was killed with poison, so to protect herself and her son Rani Kamlapati exile to his Mahal and it's also the place where it is believed that she jumped out of the window of this Mahal(back side) and in the water and died. Later on her son was also killed.\nThis monument represents the part of history from the 18th century."

The entrance of it is nearer to upper lake, now a park has been made near the surrounding of the palace  The palace is named after Rani Kamlapati. The palace has been converted to a museum. All the heritage of the late queen and his King are well preserved. If one wants to know the history and heritage then can visit this palace. Beware of the thousands bats sitting on the trees on the approach road to the palace. A guard is there who would let you inside the museum. It is a small palace and the entrance and foyer have been converted to museum. Rest of the building is not accessible by public. Thr palace is protected under ASI India. Just beside the lake you will get an amazing view of the lower lake. Please check the pictures i have provided below. This will be worth visiting there."

Its construction spanned over a period of 13 years, from 1871 to 1884.[1] It was one of the largest palaces of the world built at that time.\n\nThe building was originally named Raj Mahal (\"royal palace\"). The British Resident at Bhopal, highly impressed with the architecture, suggested that the palace be renamed the Taj Mahal, the Taj Mahal at Agra having been built by the Begum's namesake Shah Jahan. The begum accepted the suggestion and the palace was renamed to Taj Mahal.[3] The Begum is said to have ordered a three-year-long celebration called Jashn-e-Taj Mahal after the completion of the building.\n\nAfter the partition of India in 1947, Nawab Hamidullah Khan allowed Sindhi refugees to stay in the palace. They stayed in Taj Mahal for around 4 years, before shifting to Bairagarh. The palace suffered some damage during this period.[1] After India's independence, some members of the royal family of Bhopal stayed at the palace, but gradually moved away, as they had no money for the repairs. By 2008, large parts of the palace complex had collapsed.\n\nThe palace was declared a state heritage monument by the Government of Madhya Pradesh in 2005 and the state archaeology department carried out restoration in parts. However, it was de-notified in 2011. Until 2013, the Taj Mahal was under the archives department. In 2014 the monument was handled over to the Madhya Pradesh tourism department.[4]\n\nIn 2017, a private builder from Indore, was handed over the property on lease to develop the sprawling 19th century structure into a 120-room heritage hotel. As of 2023 the work is yet to be started.\n\nsource Refreshing Bhopal ❤️"
