It houses an incredible collection of artifacts from ancient times, including sculptures, fossils, coins, textiles, and more. The Egyptian mummy and the grand Buddhist galleries are particularly fascinating.\n\nThe museum is quite large, so give yourself at least 2–3 hours to explore it properly. It can get a little warm inside during summer months, so I recommend visiting in winter for a more comfortable experience. Overall, it's an enriching and educational experience that offers a glimpse into India's vast and diverse heritage.",

The collection is vast and incredibly diverse, showcasing historic items and antiques from across time and geography. The star attraction is the 4000 year old Egyptian mummy in the Egypt Gallery, which is truly fascinating. Apart from that, the museum also houses remarkable Buddhist archaeological treasures from Gandhara (present-day Kandahar, Afghanistan), along with fascinating galleries on fossils, zoology, birds, geology and what not. The Botany Survey of India is also part of this museum, adding to its richness and diversity. I would recommend keeping at least 2–3 hours aside to explore properly. This museum is a journey through both history and culture, and an absolute must visit.",

Established in the 18th century by Raja Nabakrishna Deb, a key figure in Kolkata's early history, this grand mansion has witnessed everything from British colonial soirées to Durga Puja celebrations that date back over 250 years.\nThe Rajbari's famous Durga Puja, first organized in 1757 after the Battle of Plassey, is one of the oldest and most prestigious in Kolkata. Legend has it that Lord Clive himself attended the puja as part of his efforts to win over Bengal's elite. Unlike modern pujas, the idol follows the \"Daaker Saaj\" tradition, adorned with shimmering silver foil, reflecting the regal aura of the Deb family.\nArchitecturally, the massive courtyard (Thakur Dalan), towering pillars, and faded yet elegant Indo-European design transport visitors to an era when zamindars dictated Kolkata's social and cultural landscape. Despite the passage of time, the Rajbari remains an active center for heritage events, attracting history buffs and culture lovers alike.\nInteresting fact: The Sovabazar Raj family played a crucial role in the Bengal Renaissance, with stalwarts like Raja Radhakanta Deb championing social reforms and education.\nVerdict: A timeless gateway into Bengal's regal past.\nPro tip - Visit during the Durga Puja to witness the magic of age-old traditions, where history and devotion merge in the grandest fashion.",

It's in one of the busiest routes of North Kolkata region.\n\nHall or Movie place-6/10 this was previously well in shape and maintained but over last few years we are finding the AC systems inside the hall is not at all good when the hall is full of people then the ACs installed inside the hall didn't serve it's purpose owing to lack of proper maintenance by the team. During the movie people of all ages were finding difficulties inside due to heat or summer situation but there was no proper solutions to it from the management side which is one of the biggest drawback seen recently\n\nTicket Service-9/10: tickets can be purchased online as well as there is a small box office from where also you can take advance tickets if you are not comfortable with online process.\n\nIn hall service- 8/10: inside the hall there are some vendors providing service for food and drinks and you can order from your seat as well and pay using UPI or cash as per your convenience. The food quality and quality were found to be good enough\n\nIn hall amenities- 8/10: the sound systems of the hall were found to be good woth surrounding systems and seats were also more or less comfortable although the management must work on some seats as some seats are in worn out conditions as well. There is ample space in the passage to reach your seat and ample space between chairs as well to commute in between. The screen is large enough and bright as well\n\nOverall Experience- 7/10\nOwing to the tremendous Heat or summer conditions now, looking into the AC conditions I would recommend to get any other movie hall as well if location is not your constraints. If you want to stay in North Kolkata region only then this is one of the best out here. Parking facilities are also available at back side of the place and after watching movie if you want to have a good dinner or lunch then there multiple options available in and across as well as on top of the place serving you good food of all sorts",

Built between 1840 and 1844, it is named after Sir Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, who served as the Governor-General of India in the 1830s. He was known for his liberal policies and for supporting freedom of the press, which earned him great respect.\n\nThe hall was designed in the Greek Revival style, with 30 massive Corinthian columns, giving it a neoclassical look that resembles ancient Greek temples. Initially, it housed the Calcutta Public Library and later the Imperial Library, which eventually became the National Library of India. Today, it serves as a heritage center showcasing Kolkata's cultural and historical evolution.\n\nMetcalfe Hall is a peaceful and beautifully preserved colonial-era building, perfect for history buffs and architecture lovers. The exhibitions inside are curated to reflect Kolkata's past, with displays on literature, freedom movement, and cultural transitions. It's not a typical tourist hotspot, so it's less crowded-making it ideal for a quiet, reflective visit. Entry is usually free, and photography is allowed inside. It's especially recommended if you enjoy heritage walks or want a break from the city's usual hustle.",

            "text": "Standing tall in the heart of Kolkata, Shaheed Minar is more than just a monument - it's a silent storyteller of history, rebellion, and resilience. Originally built in 1828 as the Ochterlony Monument to honor a British general, it later shed its colonial past and was renamed Shaheed Minar in 1969, paying tribute to the martyrs of India's freedom struggle.\nWith its unique blend of Egyptian, Syrian, and Turkish architectural styles, this 158-ft tall structure dominates the skyline near Esplanade. If you have the stamina to climb its 223 steps, you'll be rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of Kolkata - though public access to the top has been restricted for safety reasons.\nBeyond being a historical landmark, Shaheed Minar is also a rallying point for political meetings and protests, earning it the nickname \"Kolkata's Speaker's Corner\". From Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose to modern-day political leaders, this place has heard fiery speeches that shaped Bengal's socio-political landscape.\nInteresting Facts:\n1. Originally named after **Sir David Ochterlony, it was renamed Shaheed Minar by the West Bengal government in honor of Indian martyrs.\n2. It is one of the tallest structures in Kolkata, standing at 158 feet (48 meters).\n3. The monument has seen historic political rallies, including speeches by Netaji and Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nVerdict: A monument that has seen colonial rule, independence, and democracy in action.\nPro tip: Visit during sunset when the monument is beautifully illuminated!",

Both sites attract scholars, devotees, and tourists interested in Indian spirituality and history.

The price of ticket for tge museum is only 10 rupees & I forgot about tge price for the show. You will find the show rack on your left from the main entrance. The most important thing is photography and videography is strictly prohibited inside the house. You are allowed to take your mobile-phone with you, but you shouldn't try to take photos or videos, and it's better to keep your phone on silent mode. You should also maintain silence inside the house. To visit the whole house, you must have enough time in your hand. If you are in a hurry, I would suggest you not to visit, because to understand everything, you have to read the captions of everything i.e. paintings and the materials. You should avoid visiting there while there is hot weather as they don't have air conditioning inside the museum.",

Housed in the stately Belvedere Estate, this is India's largest library, holding over 2.2 million books, manuscripts, and rare documents that whisper stories from centuries past. If walls could talk, these would recite forgotten tales of colonial rulers, literary giants, and countless students lost in the labyrinth of knowledge.\nWalking through its grand corridors feels like stepping back in time, where the scent of old books lingers like nostalgia. Whether you're a scholar hunting down a rare manuscript, a bibliophile seeking solace, or just someone who loves the idea of getting lost in endless bookshelves, the National Library is a haven. The silence here isn't intimidating - it's the kind that nurtures thought.\nLegends say the library is haunted, but the real ghosts are the books left unread. And if nothing else, the sprawling green estate offers a peaceful escape from Kolkata's clamor.\nVerdict: A paradise for book lovers and history buffs.\nPro tip - Carry an ID, wear comfortable shoes, and let yourself get lost in its literary maze. Who knows what forgotten gem you might discover? 📚✨",

Established in 1862 under the Indian High Courts Act of 1861, it serves as the highest court for West Bengal and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nIts architecture is inspired by the Stadt-Haus in Ypres, Belgium, giving it a distinctive and historic appearance. Over the years, the court has been instrumental in shaping Indian law, handling landmark cases related to constitutional issues, civil rights, and administrative matters.\n\nThe court has both appellate and original jurisdiction, meaning it hears appeals from lower courts and also takes up cases directly. It deals with civil, criminal, and constitutional matters, making it a key pillar of the Indian judiciary. It consists of multiple benches, including a Chief Justice and several other judges who preside over cases.\n\nIn recent years, the court has been actively involved in high-profile cases, including political disputes, educational reforms, and social justice matters. It has made decisions on various legal challenges, such as teacher recruitment issues and freedom of speech cases.\n\nDespite its esteemed status, the court faces challenges such as case backlog, delays in proceedings, and administrative hurdles. However, it continues to play a crucial role in upholding justice and ensuring fair trials.",

Originally built by the British East India Company to house junior clerks (or “writers”), this red-bricked giant evolved from a mere workplace into the epicenter of Bengal's political drama.\nArchitecturally, it's a stunning blend of French Renaissance and Greco-Roman influences, complete with massive Corinthian columns, arched windows, and statues of Greek gods silently judging the bureaucrats inside. But don't be fooled by its regal exterior - this place has seen enough action to put a Bollywood thriller to shame.\nMost famous is the Chittaranjan Das-led revolution of 1930, when three young freedom fighters - Benoy, Badal, and Dinesh - stormed the building, assassinated Colonel N.S. Simpson (a ruthless British officer), and fought till their last breath. The spot, now marked as \"B.B.D. Bagh,\" stands as a tribute to their bravery.\nToday, the Writer's Building is the seat of the West Bengal state government, though its corridors echo with both political power and the occasional ghost story! Yes, some believe the spirits of former clerks still linger, probably waiting for overdue paperwork.\nVerdict: A historical gem wrapped in bureaucracy. Pro tip - visit during daylight - with the appropriate permissions - for the best view, unless you enjoy ghostly whispers of unfinished files! 🏛️📜👻",

The decor is posh but not glittery. The restaurant is housed in an old bengali residence and it honors and preseves the vibe in a delightful.manner. The colors are muted purposefully.\n\nComing to the food, they have chosen to go the fusion route, blending common bengali dishes with international cuisines and the result is quite satisfying. I wouldn't say I was blown away, but the quality of ingredients and the taste did impress me.\n\nLast but not the least, the service I received was top notch.

The movement gained further momentum when the photographer Manish Golder founded the Instagram account Calcutta Houses (@calcuttahouses) to document these old residences in an attempt to preserve their memories and records before they disappear. “When I photograph a house, it's like taking a portrait of a person,” he says, “as a house also has its distinct personality and a story.” The model and poet Karuna Ezara Parikh started using the old homes as backdrops for her fashion shoots, amassing nearly 100,000 Instagram followers.",

            "text": "Amidst the architectural splendor of Kolkata's historic district stands the iconic Town Hall, an imposing neoclassical structure that has witnessed the city's transformation from the capital of British India to the cultural epicenter of modern Bengal. Built in 1813-14 during the British Raj, Town Hall was once the beating heart of intellectual discourse, elite gatherings, and civic events. Today, it remains a significant landmark, echoing tales of Kolkata's rich past while embracing its evolving future.\n\nAn Architectural Masterpiece\nDesigned by Colonel John Henry Garstin, the Town Hall is an impressive Greco-Roman structure, featuring tall Doric columns, grand staircases, and a vast central hall. The building's majestic façade, made of chunar sandstone and brick, exudes an aura of colonial elegance, making it one of the finest examples of 19th-century British architecture in India.\n\nThe hall, spanning 12,000 square feet, was originally built to serve as a venue for European aristocrats, bureaucrats, and merchants to host balls, banquets, and official meetings. However, over time, its role evolved, and it became a hub for public discourse, political debates, and literary events.\n\nA Storied Past\n- Town Hall's early days: It was exclusively meant for the British elite, with Indians largely restricted from entering.\n- Freedom Movement connections: By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Town Hall became a meeting ground for Indian intellectuals, reformists, and nationalist leaders, discussing ideas that shaped the independence movement.\n- Post-independence evolution: After India gained independence, the hall transitioned into a civic and cultural center, hosting exhibitions, conferences, and public events.\n\nFascinating Facts About Town Hall\n- In 1897, Swami Vivekananda delivered a powerful lecture here after his triumphant return from the West.\n- Kabiguru Rabindranath Tagore, along with other literary and political figures, frequently attended discussions at this venue.\n- The Town Hall Museum, added in the 21st century, showcases a digital archive of Kolkata's history, featuring rare maps, documents, and photographs.\n\nA Historic Treasure in Need of Attention\nDespite its historical significance, Town Hall has faced periods of neglect, with structural wear threatening its grandeur. However, in recent years, restoration efforts by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation have revived its lost charm, ensuring that this colonial jewel continues to stand tall.\n\nToday, Town Hall remains a symbol of Kolkata's intellectual and political legacy, a place where history whispers through its walls, urging the present to remember its past.",

Later on he created ‘Adi Bramho samaj' which become very popular to elite class Bengalees. Rammohan has been best remembered for his pioneer work to stall ‘satidaha' where young bride had to sacrifice her life in case of husband's death. It is said he was upset when he saw his elder brother's wife become a victim of this cruel social norm.\nThe museum building was originally occupied by Ram Mohan Roy when he came to Kolkata.\nOne young lady is giving ticket and also explaining life of Ram Mohan to visitors. She studied museology and very passionate about her job. I suggested that they should upgrade exhibits to audio-visual for better interest of visitors. She said there is fund crunch. There is very little aid from state government. All regular maintenance , electricity charge, staff salary, comes from selling tickets to visitors. Anirban Ganguly, chairman of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee foundation helped them to get grant of 20lacs. The state government acquired the building in 1984 and opened it in 2010.",

While parts of the house remain residential, the rest is open to the public (with prior permission). It's a rare window into 19th-century aristocratic Bengal, filled with marble floors, chandeliers, antique clocks, grand statues, Western and Indian paintings, and even a private zoo.\n\nUnlike modern museums, this place isn't polished or curated - it's a time capsule. Dusty, grand, mysterious, and unforgettable.\n\n🖼️ Interior Attractions & Collection\nArt Collection:\n\nPaintings by European masters like Rubens, Murillo, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Titian\n\nIndian artists like Raja Ravi Varma\n\nA gallery of sculptures, including busts of Greek gods, Queen Victoria, and Napoleon\n\nMany items are originals and rare, though some may be disputed reproductions\n\nFurniture & Decor:\n\nLuxurious Victorian-era furniture\n\nHuge Belgian glass mirrors, grand chandeliers\n\nAntique clocks, urns, vases, and stained-glass windows\n\nArchitecture:\n\nOver 90 varieties of marble from Italy and India\n\nLavish courtyards, open halls, and winding staircases\n\nCorinthian pillars and rococo flourishes contrast with the Bengal-style interiors\n\nPrivate Zoo / Aviary:\n\nIndia's first private zoo (now more like a bird sanctuary)\n\nYou can spot peacocks, hornbills, toucans, deer, storks, and other exotic species in the gardens\n\n📷 Photography & Entry Policy\nPhotography is strictly prohibited, even outside the building\n\nEntry is free, but you must get a written permit from the West Bengal Tourism Information Bureau at BBD Bagh at least one day before\n\nGuided tours are compulsory – a member of the household or staff usually accompanies you\n\n⏰ Timings\nOpen: 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM\n\nClosed: Mondays and Thursdays\n\nVisit duration: ~1.5 to 2 hours for a full tour of the museum and garden\n\n✅ Positives\nRich, Rare Collection\nThe blend of Western art with Indian tradition makes this place unlike any other palace or museum in India.\n\nAuthentic Ambience\nIt's not renovated in a modern way - and that's what makes it atmospheric. It's a little dusty and faded, but that adds to the antique charm.\n\nCalm & Offbeat\nCompared to touristy places, it's quiet and crowd-free, making it perfect for a reflective visit.\n\nArchitecture\nThe stunning marble work, pillars, and symmetrical structure make it a favorite for history and design lovers.\n\n⚠️ Negatives\nPermit Process\nGetting the entry permit is inconvenient and may discourage spontaneous visitors. You can't just walk in.\n\nStrict No-Photography Rule\nNot being able to capture the visual richness can be frustrating for modern-day tourists.\n\nLimited Accessibility\nNo ramps or lifts; not suitable for wheelchairs or elderly people with mobility issues.\n\nLack of Professional Museum Experience\nSome artifacts aren't labelled, and the guided tour is informal. Don't expect modern museum curation or A/V displays.\n\nMaintenance Issues\nSome visitors feel the place needs better upkeep - dusty galleries, poor lighting in areas, and wear on antiques are common complaints.\n\n🧭 How to Reach\nNearest Metro: Girish Park (10–12 minutes walk)\n\nBus/Auto/Taxi: Located in a narrow North Kolkata lane; easiest to reach via cab or app-based ride\n\nParking: Very limited; not recommended to drive a private vehicle",

The staff was well-behaved and attentive, ensuring a smooth experience.\n\nThe food was tasty, but the portion sizes felt small compared to the high prices. Additionally, the coffee was over-extracted, likely due to old beans, and there was no cappuccino option on the menu. It would be great if they introduced more café-style items like croissants and brownies, which pair well with coffee. A complimentary cookie with coffee would also enhance the experience.\n\nA few improvements could be made, such as adding a washbasin on the first floor for convenience and serving cutlery with meals. Introducing gluten-free options in the menu would also be a welcome addition.\n\nOverall, a good place with potential, but a few refinements would make it even better.",

Bagh, this imposing white-domed beauty has been delivering drama, bills, love letters, and legal summons with equal flair since 1868.\n\nA Post Office With Serious Posture\nDesigned by Walter B. Grenville (clearly a man who didn't believe in subtle entrances), the GPO is a Neoclassical masterpiece, flaunting Corinthian pillars, giant clock towers, and a dome that could give the Capitol Building a complex. It's more regal than most palaces and about as efficient as your grandma with birthday reminders.\n\nWalk through its grand colonnades and you're instantly transported to an era where pigeons were considered rivals and the postman was the OG influencer.\n\nBeneath the Glamour, A Bit of Ghost History\nHere's a juicy nugget: the GPO was built right over the ruins of the Old Fort William, razed after the Battle of Plassey. A small plaque near the eastern steps marks the “Black Hole of Calcutta” - yes, \"that\" infamous dungeon. Now, that's some deep post-colonial subtext.\n\nFun ‘Post-al' Facts:\n- It's the largest post office in India by volume of mail handled.\n- The GPO houses a Philatelic Bureau that's a haven for stamp collectors, aka the hipsters of the postal world.\n- Still operational and elegant, it's where the past and present shake hands - in triplicate.\n\nWorth a Visit?\nAbsolutely. Whether you're sending a postcard, buying a commemorative stamp, or just gawking at the colonial grandeur, the GPO delivers - literally and metaphorically.\n\nFinal Stamp of Approval?\nThe Kolkata GPO is not just about postage - it's about poise, purpose, and nostalgia sealed in an envelope and dropped into the past. In a world of WhatsApps and DMs, it still stands proud, reminding us that sometimes, a letter in hand is worth two emails in spam.",

The food was delicious, with a great mix of flavors, and the cocktails were expertly crafted. The service was warm and attentive, adding to the overall experience. Whether you're looking for a relaxed evening with friends or a lively night out, this place has it all. Highly recommend!\n\never, while the place is quite happening, the DJ arrangement could use some improvement. The dance floor in front of the DJ is just okay, but the music selection feels outdated and lacks the energy needed to keep the crowd engaged. Updating the playlist with more trendy and upbeat tracks could significantly enhance the vibe. Definitely a lot of scope to improve on this front!",

The movement gained further momentum when the photographer Manish Golder founded the Instagram account Calcutta Houses (@calcuttahouses) to document these old residences in an attempt to preserve their memories and records before they disappear. “When I photograph a house, it's like taking a portrait of a person,” he says, “as a house also has its distinct personality and a story.” The model and poet Karuna Ezara Parikh started using the old homes as backdrops for her fashion shoots, amassing nearly 100,000 Instagram followers.",

Located on the Hindustan Road, it is on a small alley beside the big Kanishka's saree shop and the guard was kind enough to tell us where the gallery is.\n\nOnce you are inside, you will be transported to a whole different world. The hustle and bustle of the city outside will cease when the beautifully curated and displayed art covers your senses. Happened to us when we visited with the Afrah Shafiq exhibition.\n\nGo and check the gallery out. There are different shows that keep on happening and this is one gallery that is trying to keep things different in the City of Joy.",
