The white marble architecture looks stunning, especially during sunrise or sunset when the light hits the domes. The vast gardens around it are well-maintained and perfect for a peaceful walk or to sit and relax.\n\nInside, the museum offers a fascinating glimpse into colonial history, with impressive paintings, artifacts, and sculptures. The collection is quite large, so it’s worth taking your time to explore each gallery.\n\nDo plan to spend at least 2–3 hours here to fully enjoy both the museum and the surrounding gardens. There’s also a light and sound show in the evening that brings the history of the memorial to life.\n\nOverall, a must-visit place in Kolkata that combines history, architecture, and nature beautifully!"

It’s got everything—gorgeous lakes, vibrant gardens, and even mini Seven Wonders to snap pics with (just INR 30 to see ‘em)! 🚤 Boating’s a blast (INR 50–300), and I love renting a cycle (INR 70–150) to zip around. The musical fountain at night? Total magic! 🌟\n\nIt’s super family-friendly, though I wish there were more kid facilities. Everyone from toddlers to grandparents can enjoy it, but it’s not the best for wheelchairs. The park’s pretty eco-conscious with solar lights and recycling, but those plastic food stall cups bug me. ♻️ Entry’s only INR 30 (kids INR 15), and most activities are dirt cheap. Go early to dodge the weekend crowds! Pack water, sunscreen, and maybe a picnic—Eco Park’s perfect for making memories! 😄"

Spread across a vast area, it offers something for everyone—beautiful gardens, themed zones, a large lake, and plenty of open space to relax or take a long walk. The landscaping is well-maintained and the variety of attractions, like the replicas of the Seven Wonders and boating on the lake, make it an ideal spot for both families and solo visitors. I especially enjoyed the peaceful vibe away from the city’s hustle. It’s a great place to unwind, click pictures, or just spend time close to nature. Clean, spacious, and thoughtfully designed—definitely worth a visit!"

For seven wonders you can get a entry for Rs 30. Also a huge rain forests area can be ur attraction. Mist garden is another attraction. Boating specially during evening is attractive after lights come out. Island and solar done is added attraction. But need to have patience for walking."

Spread over a vast area with a huge waterbody at its center, it provides a refreshing escape from the city’s hustle and bustle. The park is thoughtfully designed with different themed gardens like the Rose Garden, Butterfly Garden, Mask Garden, and Bonsai Garden, each adding a unique charm to the experience. The Seven Wonders replica section is a major attraction, giving visitors a glimpse of world monuments in one place.\n\nFor those who enjoy outdoor activities, Eco Park offers boating, cycling, and a children’s play area, making it ideal for families. The greenery, clean walkways, and well-arranged sitting areas make it equally enjoyable for morning walkers and evening strollers. Food stalls inside the park serve quick snacks and beverages, ensuring visitors don’t need to step out for refreshments.\n\nEntry fees are reasonable, and the place is well-managed with proper security and cleanliness.

If you are thinking for investment purposes it's a perfect place. But for now it's not a good residential place.. But if you have a car then communication is not an issue. Extended bypass is there."

              "reviewText": "📍 Location: 46, Muktaram Babu Street, Chorbagan, North Kolkata\n🎯 Built in: 1835 by Raja Rajendra Mullick — a wealthy Bengali merchant and patron of the arts\n💠 Architectural Style: Neoclassical exterior with traditional Bengali inner courtyards\n\n🎨 Overview: A Palace Frozen in Time\nMarble Palace is a privately-owned mansion, still occupied by the descendants of the Mullick family. While parts of the house remain residential, the rest is open to the public (with prior permission). It's a rare window into 19th-century aristocratic Bengal, filled with marble floors, chandeliers, antique clocks, grand statues, Western and Indian paintings, and even a private zoo.\n\nUnlike modern museums, this place isn’t polished or curated — it’s a time capsule. Dusty, grand, mysterious, and unforgettable.\n\n🖼️ Interior Attractions & Collection\nArt Collection:\n\nPaintings by European masters like Rubens, Murillo, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Titian\n\nIndian artists like Raja Ravi Varma\n\nA gallery of sculptures, including busts of Greek gods, Queen Victoria, and Napoleon\n\nMany items are originals and rare, though some may be disputed reproductions\n\nFurniture & Decor:\n\nLuxurious Victorian-era furniture\n\nHuge Belgian glass mirrors, grand chandeliers\n\nAntique clocks, urns, vases, and stained-glass windows\n\nArchitecture:\n\nOver 90 varieties of marble from Italy and India\n\nLavish courtyards, open halls, and winding staircases\n\nCorinthian pillars and rococo flourishes contrast with the Bengal-style interiors\n\nPrivate Zoo / Aviary:\n\nIndia’s first private zoo (now more like a bird sanctuary)\n\nYou can spot peacocks, hornbills, toucans, deer, storks, and other exotic species in the gardens\n\n📷 Photography & Entry Policy\nPhotography is strictly prohibited, even outside the building\n\nEntry is free, but you must get a written permit from the West Bengal Tourism Information Bureau at BBD Bagh at least one day before\n\nGuided tours are compulsory – a member of the household or staff usually accompanies you\n\n⏰ Timings\nOpen: 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM\n\nClosed: Mondays and Thursdays\n\nVisit duration: ~1.5 to 2 hours for a full tour of the museum and garden\n\n✅ Positives\nRich, Rare Collection\nThe blend of Western art with Indian tradition makes this place unlike any other palace or museum in India.\n\nAuthentic Ambience\nIt’s not renovated in a modern way — and that’s what makes it atmospheric. It's a little dusty and faded, but that adds to the antique charm.\n\nCalm & Offbeat\nCompared to touristy places, it’s quiet and crowd-free, making it perfect for a reflective visit.\n\nArchitecture\nThe stunning marble work, pillars, and symmetrical structure make it a favorite for history and design lovers.\n\n⚠️ Negatives\nPermit Process\nGetting the entry permit is inconvenient and may discourage spontaneous visitors. You can’t just walk in.\n\nStrict No-Photography Rule\nNot being able to capture the visual richness can be frustrating for modern-day tourists.\n\nLimited Accessibility\nNo ramps or lifts; not suitable for wheelchairs or elderly people with mobility issues.\n\nLack of Professional Museum Experience\nSome artifacts aren’t labelled, and the guided tour is informal. Don't expect modern museum curation or A/V displays.\n\nMaintenance Issues\nSome visitors feel the place needs better upkeep — dusty galleries, poor lighting in areas, and wear on antiques are common complaints.\n\n🧭 How to Reach\nNearest Metro: Girish Park (10–12 minutes walk)\n\nBus/Auto/Taxi: Located in a narrow North Kolkata lane; easiest to reach via cab or app-based ride\n\nParking: Very limited; not recommended to drive a private vehicle"

From marble mosaic flooring, rosewood sculpture, brass statues, marble sculptures, oriental crockery and vase to victorian furniture, chandeliers, candle holders- it is an art collector's heaven. I went on a rainy day, the zoo was closed at the moment but i got to see various bird collection inside the palace. The upper floor was off limits as well due to some renovation.

              "reviewText": "Marble Palace in Kolkata is a true hidden treasure that beautifully blends art, history, and nature. The museum inside this 19th-century mansion is absolutely mesmerizing—with its stunning European statues, Victorian furniture, and rare paintings that leave you in awe. Every corner tells a story of elegance and legacy.The private zoo on the premises adds a unique charm, especially for families with kids. It’s one of the oldest zoos in India, and though small, it has a delightful collection of birds and animals.The lush gardens, grand architecture, and peaceful surroundings make it a perfect place to escape the chaos of the city. A visit here feels like stepping into a different era. Highly recommended for history lovers, art enthusiasts, and anyone looking for a memorable day in Kolkata."

Other than the fine building there is a big gate on right side which may be used for entry of big vehicle. Also another building on same side may be used for business purpose at that period.  Fine statues can be seen at top of the main building.\nThis building and some other similar type but delapidated buildings on bank of canal side road is proof of old wealthy status of this area."

However, it can feel chaotic at times, and I noticed several areas that could really use better maintenance. There was quite a bit of dirt and an unpleasant smell in some sections, which made the experience less comfortable.\n\nI truly hope the station gets a bit more attention in terms of cleanliness and overall upkeep it has great potential to offer a better experience for travelers."

It's well-connected, with frequent local and long-distance trains, and has multiple platforms, food stalls, waiting rooms, and facilities like the IRCTC Executive Lounge. The station is also easily accessible via road and metro, which adds to its convenience.\n\nHowever, the cleanliness is a serious concern. Many platforms and tracks are visibly dirty, with litter scattered around and dust piling up in corners. The toilets and washrooms are often unhygienic, lacking proper maintenance. Even the general waiting areas could use a lot more attention in terms of sanitation.\n\nPros:\n\nExcellent train connectivity across West Bengal and other states.\n\nFunctional amenities like ticket counters, lounges, and shops.\n\nEasy access via metro, taxi, and public transport.\n\nCons:\n\nPoor cleanliness standards on platforms and tracks.\n\nUnhygienic toilets and waiting areas.\n\nOvercrowded during peak hours, adding to the mess.\n\nSealdah is a vital and functional station, but needs serious improvement in hygiene and maintenance. With better cleanliness efforts, it could truly match the standards expected from a major urban railway hub."

It serves as a major railhead, where you can board long distance as well as suburban trains (local trains) of both North and South lines. The station is having over 21 platforms originating for outstation and suburban railway. Cab facility is good and variety of options including the app based and even prepaid counters. There are so many vendors within the station complex selling food items, books and other travel accessories. Information system counters is well managed. Truly a magnanimous structure in the middle of Kolkata.\nThe infrastructure has seen noticeable improvements, with better seating arrangements, executive lounges, waiting rooms, toilets, and digital display boards providing train updates. Security is decent, with RPF personnel present to maintain order. However, the station can get extremely crowded, especially during rush hours.\nDespite the congestion, Sealdah remains an efficient and well-managed railway hub that keeps Kolkata moving."

One of India’s busiest and most vibrant railway hubs, Sealdah is not just a transit point — it’s an emotion, a lifeline of the city. 🏙️🚂\n\n🛤️ Connectivity & Convenience\nSealdah Station serves as a major junction in Eastern India and is very well connected to almost every part of West Bengal and beyond. Whether you’re heading to North Bengal, Bihar, Jharkhand, or Assam, you’ll likely find your train starting or stopping here. I was amazed by the number of platforms, constant announcements, and hustle-bustle that makes this place truly alive 24x7. 🌍🔔\n\n👥 Crowd & Energy\nThe station was crowded, as expected, but everything was well-managed. Despite the rush, the movement was quite systematic. I saw travelers from all walks of life – families, students, vendors, pilgrims – everyone blending into the rhythm of the railway system. It’s truly the heart of Kolkata's travel network. ❤️🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️\n\n🏢 Infrastructure & Cleanliness\nI found the station premises relatively clean considering the huge footfall it handles daily. The platforms were well-lit, and signage was easy to follow. Security was also decent, and I noticed several RPF personnel patrolling regularly. Entry and exit gates were managed well, and the ticket counters were functioning smoothly. ✅🧹\n\n🛒 Food & Amenities\nThere are plenty of food stalls, tea vendors ☕, and bookstalls 📚 scattered throughout the station. I grabbed a quick chai and biscuit from a local vendor while waiting — an authentic railway station experience! From small snacks to full meals, you’ll find a lot of variety here.\n\n🎉 Vibrant Night View\nThe station building was beautifully lit up at night, especially during the festive season in October. The pink and purple lighting gave it a grand, almost celebratory appearance. It felt more like a heritage monument than just a station. 💡🌃\n\n📸 Captured Moments\nI’ve added some pictures and a short video clip from that evening, including shots of trains, station ambiance, and lighting. Each frame brings back the nostalgia of that moment.\n\n💬 Final Thoughts\nIf you're passing through Kolkata, Sealdah Station is more than just a stop — it's a reflection of Bengal's culture, crowd energy, and charm. It might be chaotic at times, but that’s what makes it so authentically Indian. 🇮🇳\n\n⭐ Highly recommend experiencing it once, especially during festive months like October or Durga Puja!"

The outside garden is spacious and can accommodate many people at a time. It is the best place for wedding or reception parties. But!! A big drawback is there to say no to this place. Only vegan food is allowed at this place. So it may or may not be, a major problem for you."

They would motivate you to save taxes on bookings. Once you enter this labyrinth there is no going back. There is no receipt, there is no particular person to talk to. I would request folks to be very vigilant while dealing with these land occupiers else be sure to loose money. #not recommended"

The architecture of the monument is truly impressive, with its grand white marble structure standing tall and majestic. It reflects a beautiful blend of British and Mughal design elements, making it a real treat for architecture lovers.\n\nThe environment around the memorial was peaceful and pleasant, with well-maintained gardens that add to the charm of the place. The inside houses a museum that showcases a rich collection of paintings, historical artifacts, and documents from the colonial era. It offers a great glimpse into the history of British India and Kolkata’s past.\n\nThe entire place is very clean and organized, and you can easily spend 2–3 hours exploring the museum and strolling through the beautiful gardens. It’s a perfect spot for history enthusiasts, art lovers, and even casual visitors looking to enjoy some quiet time.\n\nHowever, one downside was the presence of beggar children and small scams happening near the entrance gate. Visitors need to be a little cautious and avoid getting tricked. Despite that, the overall experience was wonderful, and I would definitely recommend visiting the Victoria Memorial if you are in Kolkata."

There is no connection between Tagore's Thakurbari & Rajbari. Dinendra Narayan Roy had built up this place. Once Laxmi Kanta Roy helped British Govt in various aspects as well wisher. After plassey war in 1857, East India Company offered him 'Roy Bahadur' title. But as per his request, his grandson Sukhamoy Roy conferred this title. Sukhamoy Roy became the only Indian director of Bank of Bengal. He along with his mother Parbati debi, donated large amount for different hospital & road development. This family had tried to maintain a safe distance from polished, fabricated Babu Culture. Dinendra Narayan, the younger generation of Sukhamoy, was the son of Brajendra Narayan Roy. Dinendra Narayan Roy was the commissioner of Kolkata Municipality Corporation (1886-1915) & had served in the position of Calcutta Port Commissioner during 1902-1904. Nowadays, this place at Rabindra Sarani is full of loneliness. Few visitors come to the place during Durga Pujo."

The white marble architecture looks stunning, especially during sunrise or sunset when the light hits the domes. The vast gardens around it are well-maintained and perfect for a peaceful walk or to sit and relax.\n\nInside, the museum offers a fascinating glimpse into colonial history, with impressive paintings, artifacts, and sculptures. The collection is quite large, so it’s worth taking your time to explore each gallery.\n\nDo plan to spend at least 2–3 hours here to fully enjoy both the museum and the surrounding gardens. There’s also a light and sound show in the evening that brings the history of the memorial to life.\n\nOverall, a must-visit place in Kolkata that combines history, architecture, and nature beautifully!"

For just ₹10, you’re welcomed into a world of calm that feels miles away from the city’s buzz.\n\nThe architecture is a sight to behold-grand Gothic arches, lofty ceilings, and stained-glass windows that catch the light just right. It’s not about flashy photos here (they don’t allow them inside), but rather about the hush in the air, the stillness that settles over you the moment you step in.\n\nIt’s a place to reflect, to breathe, to simply sit and let time slow down. Whether you’re there for a prayer or just to marvel at the history, this cathedral has a quiet charm that stays with you.\n\nA soul-soothing stop, and one I’d recommend to anyone craving a bit of grace and serenity."

Standing proudly over the Hooghly River, this cantilever bridge connects the city of Howrah with the heart of Kolkata, carrying millions of people every single day.\n\nWhat makes the Howrah Bridge truly fascinating is its sheer scale and design. Built without a single nut or bolt, it is held together entirely by rivets, a testament to the brilliance of early 20th-century engineering. Walking or driving across it, you can feel the pulse of the city—the endless flow of buses, yellow taxis, rickshaws, and pedestrians all weaving into the daily rhythm of Kolkata life.\n\nBeyond its practical importance, the bridge has immense cultural and emotional value. For many Bengalis, the first glimpse of the Howrah Bridge while entering Kolkata symbolizes “homecoming.” At night, when the bridge lights up and reflects on the waters of the Hooghly, it transforms into a breathtaking sight—one that photographers and travelers cherish.\n\nThe Howrah Bridge is more than just steel and structure; it is a silent witness to Kolkata’s history, from the days of British India to modern times. It has seen generations grow, countless stories unfold, and remains one of the busiest bridges in the world.\n\nIf you are visiting Kolkata, experiencing the Howrah Bridge—whether by walking across it, viewing it from the ghats, or taking a ferry ride underneath—is an absolute must. It is not only an engineering wonder but also the very soul of the city."

Visitors love walking across it to experience the lively local life, colorful vendors, and stunning views of the river and city, especially at sunrise or sunset. Though often crowded, the bustling energy and historic charm make it a memorable part of any Kolkata visit. At night, it looks breathtakingly beautiful when lit up. The bridge is also known for its unique construction without nuts or bolts, held together by rivets. Overall, it’s a timeless landmark that perfectly captures Kolkata’s spirit."

The view of the Hooghly River from the bridge is beautiful during sunrise or sunset.\n3. At night, the lights on the bridge give it a nice glow.\n4. It connects the busy Howrah Railway Station with Kolkata city, so it's historically important.\n5. For people interested in raw city life, walking across it feels like stepping into Kolkata’s real daily rhythm.\n\n🔴What I didn’t like (and others should know)🔴\n\n6. The surrounding area is one of the dirtiest I’ve seen — garbage, spit, urine — it’s everywhere.\n7. It’s overcrowded with honking traffic, vendors, and people rushing in every direction.\n8. No one follows traffic rules, and there’s zero lane discipline.\n9. Ola and taxi drivers around the area are known for overcharging, refusing to turn on the AC, and behaving rudely.\n10. If you still want to go, visit early morning or late evening — it's slightly better and less crowded then."

The collection is vast and incredibly diverse, showcasing historic items and antiques from across time and geography.

Apart from that, the museum also houses remarkable Buddhist archaeological treasures from Gandhara (present-day Kandahar, Afghanistan), along with fascinating galleries on fossils, zoology, birds, geology and what not. The Botany Survey of India is also part of this museum, adding to its richness and diversity. I would recommend keeping at least 2–3 hours aside to explore properly.

              "reviewText": "The iconic Writer’s Building — Kolkata’s grand old office — has been watching history unfold since 1777, making it older than the United States of America’s constitution! Originally built by the British East India Company to house junior clerks (or “writers”), this red-bricked giant evolved from a mere workplace into the epicenter of Bengal’s political drama.\nArchitecturally, it’s a stunning blend of French Renaissance and Greco-Roman influences, complete with massive Corinthian columns, arched windows, and statues of Greek gods silently judging the bureaucrats inside. But don’t be fooled by its regal exterior — this place has seen enough action to put a Bollywood thriller to shame.\nMost famous is the Chittaranjan Das-led revolution of 1930, when three young freedom fighters — Benoy, Badal, and Dinesh — stormed the building, assassinated Colonel N.S. Simpson (a ruthless British officer), and fought till their last breath. The spot, now marked as \"B.B.D. Bagh,\" stands as a tribute to their bravery.\nToday, the Writer’s Building is the seat of the West Bengal state government, though its corridors echo with both political power and the occasional ghost story! Yes, some believe the spirits of former clerks still linger, probably waiting for overdue paperwork.\nVerdict: A historical gem wrapped in bureaucracy. Pro tip — visit during daylight - with the appropriate permissions - for the best view, unless you enjoy ghostly whispers of unfinished files! 🏛️📜👻"

              "reviewText": "Origin and Purpose:\nConstructed between 1777 and 1780, it was initially designed by Thomas Lyon to be the principal administrative office for junior clerks, or \"writers,\" of the British East India Company (EIC).\nIt was the first three-storied building in Kolkata.\nOver time, it underwent numerous extensions and renovations.\nArchitectural Features:\nThe building exhibits a Greco-Roman style with French Renaissance influences.\nIt features a portico in the central bay and boasts several statues, including Minerva, atop the pediment.\nThe terrace is adorned with statues representing \"Justice,\" \"Commerce,\" \"Science,\" and \"Agriculture,\" flanked by European and Indian practitioners.\nThe structure is characterized by its red exposed brick facade.\nHistorical Significance:\nThe Writers' Building served as the headquarters of the East India Company in Bengal.\nIt housed Fort William College, which provided training in Oriental languages to writers.\nIn the 19th century, it became the office of the secretariat of Bengal when Calcutta was the capital of British India.\nIt is linked to a significant event in the Indian independence movement: the assassination of Lt. Colonel N. S. Simpson by three Bengali revolutionaries - Benoy Basu, Badal Gupta, and Dinesh Gupta. The square surrounding the building was later renamed B.B.D. Bagh in their honor.\nCurrent Status and Renovation:\nSince India's independence in 1947, it has served as the State Secretariat and the office of the Chief Minister of West Bengal.\nIt is currently undergoing a major restoration and renovation project, which was initiated in late 2013 with an estimated cost of US$29 million.\nDuring the renovation, the Chief Minister's office and other government departments temporarily shifted to a building called Nabanna in Howrah.\nThe restoration process has faced delays and challenges, but work on the project continues.\nWhile entry into the main building is restricted to employees, visitors can admire its impressive exterior."

Established in 1862 under the Indian High Courts Act of 1861, it serves as the highest court for West Bengal and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nIts architecture is inspired by the Stadt-Haus in Ypres, Belgium, giving it a distinctive and historic appearance. Over the years, the court has been instrumental in shaping Indian law, handling landmark cases related to constitutional issues, civil rights, and administrative matters.\n\nThe court has both appellate and original jurisdiction, meaning it hears appeals from lower courts and also takes up cases directly. It deals with civil, criminal, and constitutional matters, making it a key pillar of the Indian judiciary. It consists of multiple benches, including a Chief Justice and several other judges who preside over cases.\n\nIn recent years, the court has been actively involved in high-profile cases, including political disputes, educational reforms, and social justice matters. It has made decisions on various legal challenges, such as teacher recruitment issues and freedom of speech cases.\n\nDespite its esteemed status, the court faces challenges such as case backlog, delays in proceedings, and administrative hurdles. However, it continues to play a crucial role in upholding justice and ensuring fair trials."

              "reviewText": "The Kolkata High Court (a.k.a. Calcutta High Court) is not just a functioning judicial body, it’s a monumental work of art that serves as the symbol of the legal legacy of Bengal. Situated at the heart of Esplanade/BBD Bag, this Gothic-style marvel isn’t just one of the oldest High Courts in India, it’s a stunning feat of architecture that takes you back to the British Raj era with a pinch of grandeur.\n\nArchitectural Splendor\nCompleted in 1872, the building was designed by Walter B. Grenville in the Gothic Revival style, which was all the rage in the Victorian era. From its towering spires, ornate arches, to the intricate carvings, this court building is a work of visual storytelling. If you’ve ever wondered why Kolkata is often described as “the city of palaces,” this iconic red-brick structure with its imposing façade is the perfect example of that regal architecture.\n\nA Center of Legal History\nMore than just a historical structure, the Kolkata High Court is a place where the rich history of Indian law and politics has unfolded. It's where some of the most famous legal battles in the country’s history were fought, and where historic verdicts that shaped modern India were delivered. It’s fascinating to think about the many significant cases and precedents set here, considering this court serves the state of West Bengal and the Union Territory of Andaman and Nicobar Islands.\n\nFun Fact\nAn interesting tidbit — the Kolkata High Court’s structure has inspired several replicas of Gothic architecture across the world. While most visitors marvel at its exterior, the interiors, with their high ceilings, large wooden panels, and carved arches, are no less impressive.\n\nConclusion\nKolkata High Court is much more than just a temple of law; it’s a living symbol of Kolkata’s rather complex colonial past, beautifully preserved to stand tall and make an impact. Whether you’re a history buff, architecture enthusiast, or simply someone seeking to experience a slice of Kolkata’s heritage, this building is a must-visit for its grandiosity and legacy."

              "reviewText": "Amidst the architectural splendor of Kolkata’s historic district stands the iconic Town Hall, an imposing neoclassical structure that has witnessed the city’s transformation from the capital of British India to the cultural epicenter of modern Bengal. Built in 1813-14 during the British Raj, Town Hall was once the beating heart of intellectual discourse, elite gatherings, and civic events. Today, it remains a significant landmark, echoing tales of Kolkata’s rich past while embracing its evolving future.\n\nAn Architectural Masterpiece\nDesigned by Colonel John Henry Garstin, the Town Hall is an impressive Greco-Roman structure, featuring tall Doric columns, grand staircases, and a vast central hall. The building's majestic façade, made of chunar sandstone and brick, exudes an aura of colonial elegance, making it one of the finest examples of 19th-century British architecture in India.\n\nThe hall, spanning 12,000 square feet, was originally built to serve as a venue for European aristocrats, bureaucrats, and merchants to host balls, banquets, and official meetings. However, over time, its role evolved, and it became a hub for public discourse, political debates, and literary events.\n\nA Storied Past\n- Town Hall’s early days: It was exclusively meant for the British elite, with Indians largely restricted from entering.\n- Freedom Movement connections: By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Town Hall became a meeting ground for Indian intellectuals, reformists, and nationalist leaders, discussing ideas that shaped the independence movement.\n- Post-independence evolution: After India gained independence, the hall transitioned into a civic and cultural center, hosting exhibitions, conferences, and public events.\n\nFascinating Facts About Town Hall\n- In 1897, Swami Vivekananda delivered a powerful lecture here after his triumphant return from the West.\n- Kabiguru Rabindranath Tagore, along with other literary and political figures, frequently attended discussions at this venue.\n- The Town Hall Museum, added in the 21st century, showcases a digital archive of Kolkata’s history, featuring rare maps, documents, and photographs.\n\nA Historic Treasure in Need of Attention\nDespite its historical significance, Town Hall has faced periods of neglect, with structural wear threatening its grandeur. However, in recent years, restoration efforts by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation have revived its lost charm, ensuring that this colonial jewel continues to stand tall.\n\nToday, Town Hall remains a symbol of Kolkata’s intellectual and political legacy, a place where history whispers through its walls, urging the present to remember its past."

But, got saddened to see the way KMC people are taking care of the whole property.\n\nThe main auditorium on the first floor is still better, if not well-maintained. But the lavatories are pathetic. I entered and literally bounced back. It is being rented out for private events these days. But if you experience the washrooms, it's no better than a \"Sulabh.\" Even some of the \"Sulabhs\" in Kolkata are better maintained than this.\n\nPls wake up the authorities and look into it."

              "reviewText": "The National Library of Kolkata isn’t just a library — it’s a treasure trove of history, knowledge, and quiet rebellion against the city’s perpetual chaos. Housed in the stately Belvedere Estate, this is India’s largest library, holding over 2.2 million books, manuscripts, and rare documents that whisper stories from centuries past. If walls could talk, these would recite forgotten tales of colonial rulers, literary giants, and countless students lost in the labyrinth of knowledge.\nWalking through its grand corridors feels like stepping back in time, where the scent of old books lingers like nostalgia. Whether you're a scholar hunting down a rare manuscript, a bibliophile seeking solace, or just someone who loves the idea of getting lost in endless bookshelves, the National Library is a haven. The silence here isn’t intimidating — it’s the kind that nurtures thought.\nLegends say the library is haunted, but the real ghosts are the books left unread. And if nothing else, the sprawling green estate offers a peaceful escape from Kolkata’s clamor.\nVerdict: A paradise for book lovers and history buffs.\nPro tip — Carry an ID, wear comfortable shoes, and let yourself get lost in its literary maze. Who knows what forgotten gem you might discover? 📚✨"

It is the first library in Eastern India and the largest library overall on the Indian Subcontinent in terms of volume. Being the first modern city of the British Empire outside of Great Britain, Kolkata had many advantages, but its rich heritage in terms of architecture, art, and culture deserves special mention. 30 acres make up the library's land area. The National Library claims of having the greatest collection of books, journals, magazines, manuscripts, and newspapers in both Indian and foreign languages. It is maintained by the joint efforts of the Department of Culture, Ministry of Tourism, and the Government of India."

Established in 1767, this is one of the oldest non-church cemeteries in the world, a silent witness to the city’s British-era grandeur. Forget horror movies — this place is less \"The Conjuring\" and more \"Downton Abbey meets The Jungle Book\", with gothic tombs draped in banyan roots and squirrels darting between centuries-old epitaphs.\nAmong the notable “residents” here are Sir William Jones, the founder of the Asiatic Society, and Rose Aylmer, the muse of poet Walter Savage Landor (whose love for her was so deep, he wrote a poem that outlived empires). Many tombstones tell tales of lives cut short by tropical diseases, duels, and sometimes, just bad luck in 18th-century Kolkata.\nThe architecture is stunning — grand obelisks, pyramid-like tombs, and intricate carvings that scream Raj-era drama. And if you think cemeteries are spooky, try visiting on a foggy winter morning when the light filters through the trees — it’s eerily beautiful.\nVerdict: A hauntingly poetic escape in the heart of Kolkata.\nPro tip — Carry a camera, read the inscriptions, and remember, in a city that never sleeps, even the departed have fascinating stories to tell. 🪦🌿📜"

We visited as out-of-town tourists, in Nov 2024.\n\nVery green and shady, benches are available and maintained like a park.\n\nTricky to get here as a tourist. No metro stations nearby. We visited during peak traffic time, so no cabs were picking up our requests. So ended up walking to and from here."

Open daily from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., this place feels like a trip back in time with its old colonial tombs and lush greenery. Entry is 25 rs, and the atmosphere is calm, perfect for a quiet stroll or even photography. It's not too crowded, which makes it ideal for those who enjoy some solitude while exploring the past. Just remember to bring some water and be prepared for the heat if you visit during the day!"

Nestled like a grand old Maharaja at the heart of B.B.D. Bagh, this imposing white-domed beauty has been delivering drama, bills, love letters, and legal summons with equal flair since 1868.\n\nA Post Office With Serious Posture\nDesigned by Walter B. Grenville (clearly a man who didn’t believe in subtle entrances), the GPO is a Neoclassical masterpiece, flaunting Corinthian pillars, giant clock towers, and a dome that could give the Capitol Building a complex. It’s more regal than most palaces and about as efficient as your grandma with birthday reminders.\n\nWalk through its grand colonnades and you're instantly transported to an era where pigeons were considered rivals and the postman was the OG influencer.\n\nBeneath the Glamour, A Bit of Ghost History\nHere's a juicy nugget: the GPO was built right over the ruins of the Old Fort William, razed after the Battle of Plassey. A small plaque near the eastern steps marks the “Black Hole of Calcutta” — yes, \"that\" infamous dungeon. Now, that’s some deep post-colonial subtext.\n\nFun ‘Post-al’ Facts:\n- It’s the largest post office in India by volume of mail handled.\n- The GPO houses a Philatelic Bureau that’s a haven for stamp collectors, aka the hipsters of the postal world.\n- Still operational and elegant, it’s where the past and present shake hands — in triplicate.\n\nWorth a Visit?\nAbsolutely. Whether you’re sending a postcard, buying a commemorative stamp, or just gawking at the colonial grandeur, the GPO delivers — literally and metaphorically.\n\nFinal Stamp of Approval?\nThe Kolkata GPO is not just about postage — it’s about poise, purpose, and nostalgia sealed in an envelope and dropped into the past. In a world of WhatsApps and DMs, it still stands proud, reminding us that sometimes, a letter in hand is worth two emails in spam."

Lot of old postal stamps, machines and letters to be seen here. It's beautiful and has been donated by people who like and have been collecting stamps/artifiacts for a long time.\n\nThere are real telegrams also displayed along with real Post boxes from Chennai used in places of high order like the Raj Bhavan or important areas.\n\nSweet and simple. Must visit once for people who love history.\nThe cafe here is nice. Well lit and wel kept. Food is so so but coffee at 50/- was good."

For taking photo additionally they charge 50/-. He was believer of one God, unlike Hindus who warship many Gods with rigid rituals. For this reason he was thrown out of his home by his father. Later on he created ‘Adi Bramho samaj’ which become very popular to elite class Bengalees. Rammohan has been best remembered for his pioneer work to stall ‘satidaha’ where young bride had to sacrifice her life in case of husband’s death. It is said he was upset when he saw his elder brother’s wife become a victim of this cruel social norm.\nThe museum building was originally occupied by Ram Mohan Roy when he came to Kolkata.\nOne young lady is giving ticket and also explaining life of Ram Mohan to visitors. She studied museology and very passionate about her job. I suggested that they should upgrade exhibits to audio-visual for better interest of visitors. She said there is fund crunch. There is very little aid from state government. All regular maintenance , electricity charge, staff salary, comes from selling tickets to visitors. Anirban Ganguly, chairman of Shyam Prasad Mukherjee foundation helped them to get grant of 20lacs. The state government acquired the building in 1984 and opened it in 2010."

Built between 1840 and 1844, it is named after Sir Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, who served as the Governor-General of India in the 1830s. He was known for his liberal policies and for supporting freedom of the press, which earned him great respect.\n\nThe hall was designed in the Greek Revival style, with 30 massive Corinthian columns, giving it a neoclassical look that resembles ancient Greek temples. Initially, it housed the Calcutta Public Library and later the Imperial Library, which eventually became the National Library of India. Today, it serves as a heritage center showcasing Kolkata’s cultural and historical evolution.\n\nMetcalfe Hall is a peaceful and beautifully preserved colonial-era building, perfect for history buffs and architecture lovers. The exhibitions inside are curated to reflect Kolkata’s past, with displays on literature, freedom movement, and cultural transitions. It’s not a typical tourist hotspot, so it’s less crowded—making it ideal for a quiet, reflective visit. Entry is usually free, and photography is allowed inside. It’s especially recommended if you enjoy heritage walks or want a break from the city’s usual hustle."

The hall is dedicated to the vibe of Kolkata and bringing it's history and culture together. It has gained quite a lot of attention due to several reels that was done by (wannabe) influencers. The crowd those who are visiting are less interested in the information and more to take that ultimate photo!\nThe first floor is where all the fun is. Quite photogenic and full of short but important information. The ground floor it seems was done in a haste and not planned or curated properly. For which the Metcalfe Hall gets a 4 star"

Once the hall hosted the Calcutta Public Library, featuring near about 5000 books transferred from Fort William & various donations. Dwarkanath Tagore served as its first proprietor. The hall became the Imperial Library in 1903 under Lord Curzon, eventually the nucleus of the National Library, which moved to Belvedere House in 1925. Later taken over by the ASI in the year 1992, extensive restoration was completed in 2018–19 & reopened as an exhibition & cultural space.\n\nThis stunning neoclassical Greek-revival was inspired by Athens, modeled after the Ancient Greek Tower (Temple) of the Winds, was free of cost earlier when I visited a few years back. The rectangular two-storey hall with five chambers, a majestic western stairway (now closed), and the main entrance on Hare Street is now charged Rs. 20/- per person. At the very first moment you reach, you have to scan the code & pay the said amount. A single person (single payment system) can purchase or pay for five persons at once. Your identity proof (namely Aadhar card or number) is a must for entrance. If people visit in a group, then the identity proof of any one member can be considered valid.\n\nIt will take approx 2 hours to completely tour the entire museum. The place is indeed photogenic. You can often find some photographers & vloggers with their models. These things are more or less destroying the peaceful & vintage vibes of the place I guess. Need more maintenance as the visitors knowingly or unknowingly damaged its properties which is not a good sign.\n\nIf you're exploring the historic BBD Bag area or visiting the Hooghly riverfront, this is a must see, especially for those who appreciate heritage, art & Bengali ethos."

As one of the oldest and most respected planetariums in India, Birla Planetarium truly lives up to its reputation.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the planetarium's stunning architecture. The building's unique design, with its distinctive dome-shaped auditorium, is a marvel in itself. But it's what's inside that really counts – and I was blown away by the planetarium's cutting-edge technology and engaging exhibits.\n\nWe attended one of the planetarium's daily shows, which took us on a virtual tour of the universe. The show was informative, entertaining, and visually stunning, with breathtaking graphics and animations that left us all mesmerized. The planetarium's state-of-the-art digital projection system and immersive sound design made the experience feel almost lifelike.\n\nBut the Birla Planetarium is more than just a planetarium – it's also a museum, with a range of exhibits that explore the wonders of astronomy and space science. We spent several hours exploring the exhibits, which included interactive displays, scale models, and even a collection of rare astronomical artifacts.\n\nOne of the highlights of our visit was the planetarium's 3D theater, which screened a fascinating documentary on the universe. The 3D effects were stunning, and the documentary itself was both informative and entertaining.\n\nIn terms of amenities, the planetarium has a small cafeteria, a souvenir shop, and clean restrooms. The staff are friendly and knowledgeable, and there are plenty of signs and guides to help you navigate the exhibits.\n\nOverall, the Birla Planetarium is a must-visit attraction in Kolkata, especially for families, science enthusiasts, and anyone interested in astronomy and space science. With its cutting-edge technology, engaging exhibits, and stunning architecture, it's a truly unforgettable experience."

              "reviewText": "A Peaceful Evening at Prinsep Ghat, Kolkata\n\nThere’s something quietly magical about Prinsep Ghat—and this photo really says it all. Nestled along the banks of the Hooghly River, this place becomes pure poetry after sunset. The iconic Vidyasagar Setu stands tall in the background, its lights casting shimmering reflections on the water. You’ll often find little boats bobbing gently nearby, their canopies glowing softly under the moonlight.\n\nWhat makes Prinsep Ghat special isn’t just the view—it’s the feeling. The cool breeze, the sound of water lapping against the shore, and the distant hum of the city create this peaceful pocket where time seems to slow down. Whether you’re out for a quiet walk, deep in thought, or simply sitting by the water with a cup of chai, it’s the kind of place that lets you breathe a little deeper.\n\nThere’s no rush here. People come with friends, with loved ones, or alone—and somehow, everyone finds a little calm. You’ll see couples talking quietly on benches, photographers capturing long-exposure shots of the bridge, and boatmen offering rides across the glowing river.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in Kolkata, take an evening to visit. Trust me, it’s more than just a pretty view—it’s a moment you’ll carry with you.\n\nMy Take: Peaceful, scenic, and perfect for slowing down.\nWhen to Go: At sunset. The city lights reflecting on the water? Unreal.\nDon’t Miss: A boat ride under the bridge and grabbing some street snacks near the riverside."

The museum showcases his personal belongings, rare photographs, and exhibits on his life and teachings. It serves as a center for Vedanta studies, meditation, and youth development programs. The restored architecture reflects the 19th-century Bengali style, offering visitors a glimpse into his early life. Ramakrishna Mancha, located nearby, hosts lectures, spiritual discourses, and cultural events inspired by his philosophy. Both sites attract scholars, devotees, and tourists interested in Indian spirituality and history. Together, they play a vital role in spreading the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Sri Ramakrishna. Spent a peaceful time with only 10 rupees entrance ticket. Also you can watch 3D movie by paying 30 rupees. Shoe rack is provided free of cost. Parking in front of the museum is not allowed but you can get it nearby."

From his birth to death, achievements every moments are presented wonderfully through paintings and digital media. There is also a visual show on him. You have to buy that ticket at the entry desk. The price of ticket for tge museum is only 10 rupees & I forgot about tge price for the show. You will find the show rack on your left from the main entrance. The most important thing is photography and videography is strictly prohibited inside the house. You are allowed to take your mobile-phone with you, but you shouldn’t try to take photos or videos, and it's better to keep your phone on silent mode. You should also maintain silence inside the house. To visit the whole house, you must have enough time in your hand. If you are in a hurry, I would suggest you not to visit, because to understand everything, you have to read the captions of everything i.e. paintings and the materials. You should avoid visiting there while there is hot weather as they don't have air conditioning inside the museum."

Meditation Hall and Temple\nA calm space for quiet meditation and prayer, with soft chanting playing in the background.\n\nA small Shiva temple in the complex reflects the Datta family’s traditional religious roots.\n\n📚 EDUCATION & OUTREACH (CULTURAL CENTRE)\nThis isn’t just a museum — it’s a living institution:\n\nOffers classes in:\n\nSpoken English, Sanskrit, French, German, Spanish\n\nComputer literacy, soft skills, communication\n\nYoga (general & certified training)\n\nHas a public library of over 6,000 books (spirituality, science, Indian culture)\n\nConducts seminars, youth leadership programs, cultural talks, and health awareness camps\n\nRuns a charitable dispensary offering homeopathic and allopathic care for the community\n\n📷 PHOTOGRAPHY POLICY\nPhotography is allowed in the outer courtyard, garden, and temple areas\n\nPhotography and videography are strictly prohibited inside the rooms, galleries, and birth room — guards may intervene if rules are broken\n\nVisitors are expected to maintain silence inside museum zones"

This two-century-old house, where Narendranath Dutta (later Swami Vivekananda) was born in 1863, has been beautifully restored by the Ramakrishna Mission, preserving the aura of the legend who took Vedanta to the world.\nWalking through its corridors, you can almost hear the echoes of young Narendranath debating philosophy, learning music, and preparing for his journey that would take him to the 1893 Parliament of World Religions in Chicago, where his “Sisters and Brothers of America” speech electrified the audience.\nThe house has been transformed into a museum and cultural center, showcasing rare photographs, letters, and personal belongings of Swamiji. The meditation hall on the top floor, bathed in soft light, offers a serene escape — a stark contrast to Kolkata’s usual chaos.\nInteresting fact: The architectural style of the house is a blend of traditional Bengali and colonial elements, reflecting the cultural synthesis that shaped Vivekananda’s thoughts.\nVerdict: A must-visit for history buffs, spiritual seekers, and anyone who wants to walk in the footsteps of one of India’s greatest minds.\nPro tip — Sit in the meditation hall for a few minutes; it’s the kind of peace that even a cup of Kolkata’s best cha can’t offer."

              "reviewText": "• The Academy of Fine Arts in Kolkata is a celebrated space for visual arts and culture, known for hosting exhibitions, theatre performances, and promoting artistic expression across generations. It has been an integral part of Kolkata’s cultural identity for decades.\n\n• 📍 Located near Nandan and not far from Rabindra Sadan or Exide More, it is easily reachable via the Rabindra Sadan Metro Station. While not directly beside Nandan, it's a short and easy walk from there, nestled in a lively and artistic corner of the city.\n\n• I visited the Academy of Fine Arts for the first time yesterday with my cousins, and we explored both a painting and photography exhibition. It was a memorable and inspiring experience, offering a calm and unhurried space to truly appreciate the works on display. 🎨📸\n\n• The exhibitions featured a diverse mix of styles and themes, from bold contemporary pieces to emotional, narrative-driven photography. The environment inside was peaceful, allowing us to connect with the art without distraction. The lighting and display arrangements were modest but effective.\n\n• It’s also worth noting that there was no entry fee, which makes it even more accessible for anyone interested in exploring art. Despite being a free-entry venue, the experience didn’t feel lacking in any way — it’s clear the focus here is on substance over flash.\n\n---\n\nOverall: The Academy of Fine Arts is a must-visit for art lovers in Kolkata. ✨ If you're looking to engage with meaningful painting and photography in a quiet, thoughtful setting — without spending a rupee — this is a wonderful place to start."

The Academy of Fine Arts is where you go to breathe in brushstrokes, amateur photography, and sometimes some delightfully weird installations.\n\n📍Location & How to Reach:\nPractically attached to Nandan, just a few steps away. Take the Rabindra Sadan Metro (Blue Line), and once you're out, you’ll reach in under 3–4 minutes on foot. Can’t miss it—it's tucked beside cultural legends.\n\n🎨Experience:\nVisited for a painting and photography exhibition—and wow, it was surprisingly impressive. The layout was simple, nothing OTT, but the artworks had depth. You could just walk in (no entry fee), take your time, and let the silence of the halls do the talking.\n\nThe vibe is peaceful. No rush, no loud tour groups, just people slowly taking in the art. And hey, you don’t need to be an art snob to enjoy it. It’s raw, real, and very Kolkata."

It's in one of the busiest routes of North Kolkata region.\n\nHall or Movie place-6/10 this was previously well in shape and maintained but over last few years we are finding the AC systems inside the hall is not at all good when the hall is full of people then the ACs installed inside the hall didn't serve it's purpose owing to lack of proper maintenance by the team. During the movie people of all ages were finding difficulties inside due to heat or summer situation but there was no proper solutions to it from the management side which is one of the biggest drawback seen recently\n\nTicket Service-9/10: tickets can be purchased online as well as there is a small box office from where also you can take advance tickets if you are not comfortable with online process.\n\nIn hall service- 8/10: inside the hall there are some vendors providing service for food and drinks and you can order from your seat as well and pay using UPI or cash as per your convenience. The food quality and quality were found to be good enough\n\nIn hall amenities- 8/10: the sound systems of the hall were found to be good woth surrounding systems and seats were also more or less comfortable although the management must work on some seats as some seats are in worn out conditions as well. There is ample space in the passage to reach your seat and ample space between chairs as well to commute in between. The screen is large enough and bright as well\n\nOverall Experience- 7/10\nOwing to the tremendous Heat or summer conditions now, looking into the AC conditions I would recommend to get any other movie hall as well if location is not your constraints. If you want to stay in North Kolkata region only then this is one of the best out here. Parking facilities are also available at back side of the place and after watching movie if you want to have a good dinner or lunch then there multiple options available in and across as well as on top of the place serving you good food of all sorts"

Nestled in the heart of Hatibagan, this heritage gem is the Broadway of Bengal — minus the overpriced tickets and plus a healthy dose of cha and telebhaja outside.\n\nOriginally built in 1883, the Star Theatre was the crown jewel of Bengali theatre — think of it as the Netflix Originals of the 19th century, only live and with better acoustics. It was here that Binodini Dasi (better known as Noti Binodini), the legendary actress and trailblazing feminist, made waves at a time when women on stage were as rare as air conditioning in trams.\n\nStarry Facts for Your Cultural Appetite\n- The theatre was originally funded and supported by Girish Chandra Ghosh and Binodini Dasi (aka Noti Binodini), who dared to challenge Victorian prudishness with pure talent and courage.\n- In 1902, Star Theatre made cinematic history by screening one of India’s earliest silent films.\n- Raja Ram Mohan Roy, Kabiguru Rabindranath Tagore, and even Swami Vivekananda were known to frequent or discuss this hub of high art.\n- After a devastating fire in 1991, the theatre rose phoenix-style, rebuilt with a blend of modern touches and old-school charm.\n\nToday, it's still a melting pot of theatre, film screenings, school functions, and the occasional Bollywood B-lister stage show. It may not scream “glamour” anymore, but it definitely whispers “legacy.”\n\nWhat’s the Vibe?\nImagine Shakespeare with a Bengali accent. Add a plate of phuchka. Stir in a dramatic monologue. That’s Star for you. It's where culture meets chaos, and the ghosts of old actors might just be whispering in the wings, still perfecting their lines.\n\nSo, the next time you're near Hatibagan, take a bow in front of Star Theatre — because this is not just a stage, it's the heartbeat of Bengali theatre.\n\nAnd remember: All the world’s a stage, but some stages are just more iconic."

I remember visiting this place and it was just a cosy cafe with a small shop. This time, I was happy to see they have expanded and added another floor where they now have a restaurant.\n\nFirstly, the ambiance is a perfect blend of class and minimalism. The decor is posh but not glittery. The restaurant is housed in an old bengali residence and it honors and preseves the vibe in a delightful.manner. The colors are muted purposefully.\n\nComing to the food, they have chosen to go the fusion route, blending common bengali dishes with international cuisines and the result is quite satisfying. I wouldn't say I was blown away, but the quality of ingredients and the taste did impress me.\n\nLast but not the least, the service I received was top notch. The staff members are attentive and polite. I would happily give them full marks for this.\n\nThe prices are on the higher side."

Cheese puff with Gandhoraj Chilli Jam was delightful. We also tried Bhetki a la Kiev with radhuni butter and aloo mash, and chicken katsu with hand made noodles and Lal jhol. These too were very tasty. Price is a bit on the higher side, but worth paying for the taste, creativity and plating"

The hustle and bustle of the city outside will cease when the beautifully curated and displayed art covers your senses. Happened to us when we visited with the Afrah Shafiq exhibition.\n\nGo and check the gallery out.

              "reviewText": "Standing tall in the heart of Kolkata, Shaheed Minar is more than just a monument — it’s a silent storyteller of history, rebellion, and resilience. Originally built in 1828 as the Ochterlony Monument to honor a British general, it later shed its colonial past and was renamed Shaheed Minar in 1969, paying tribute to the martyrs of India’s freedom struggle.\nWith its unique blend of Egyptian, Syrian, and Turkish architectural styles, this 158-ft tall structure dominates the skyline near Esplanade. If you have the stamina to climb its 223 steps, you’ll be rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of Kolkata — though public access to the top has been restricted for safety reasons.\nBeyond being a historical landmark, Shaheed Minar is also a rallying point for political meetings and protests, earning it the nickname \"Kolkata’s Speaker’s Corner\". From Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose to modern-day political leaders, this place has heard fiery speeches that shaped Bengal’s socio-political landscape.\nInteresting Facts:\n1. Originally named after **Sir David Ochterlony, it was renamed Shaheed Minar by the West Bengal government in honor of Indian martyrs.\n2. It is one of the tallest structures in Kolkata, standing at 158 feet (48 meters).\n3. The monument has seen historic political rallies, including speeches by Netaji and Mahatma Gandhi.\n\nVerdict: A monument that has seen colonial rule, independence, and democracy in action.\nPro tip: Visit during sunset when the monument is beautifully illuminated!"

Please beautify the surrounding and clean the area.\nFrom Wikipedia:- The Shaheed Minar (English: Martyrs' Monument), formerly known as the Ochterlony Monument, is a monument in Kolkata that was erected in 1828 in memory of Major-general Sir David Ochterlony, commander of the British East India Company, to commemorate both his successful defense of Delhi against the Marathas in 1804 and the victory of the East India Company’s armed forces over the Gurkhas in the Anglo-Nepalese War, also known as the Gurkha War. The monument was designed by J. P. Parker and paid for from public funds.On 9 August 1969, it was rededicated to the memory of the martyrs of the Indian freedom movement and renamed the \"Shaheed Minar,\" which means \"martyrs' monument\" in both Bengali and Hindi, by the then United Front Government in memory of the martyrs of the Indian independence movement. The last people to have been up there were former governor Gopal Krishna Gandhi and his family. Known as the \"Cloud kissing Monument\" by Mark Twain, the Shaheed Minar is located at Esplanade in Central Kolkata in the north-east facet of the Maidan. The tower is 48 metres (157 ft) high. It has a foundation based on the Egyptian style.\n\nThe column is a combination of styles with a classical fluted column, a Syrian upper portion, and a Turkish dome. It has two balconies at the top. The top floor of the minar is accessible by a serpentine staircase, a total of 223 steps. It has a total of 218 steps until the top of the tower.The vast field to the south of Shaheed Minar, is known as the Shaheed Minar Maidan or the Brigade Ground. It has a history of being the site of political rallies and fairs. The first political meeting on the ground was presided over by Rabindranath Tagore to condemn the killings of Santosh Kumar Mitra and Tarakeswar Sengupta by the Indian Imperial Police in 1931. The central bus terminus of the city is around the monument.In 1997, a tourist jumped off the lower balcony of the monument. Since then, police permission is required to climb the steps of the monument. Local residents must submit proof of address and a photo ID at the Lalbazar Police Headquarters, while out-of-town tourists must submit documents from their hotel, and foreigners must submit a copy of their passport.\n\nThe monument offers a bird's-eye view of the city.The government has planned to open the monument to the public, after the renovation work is completed. The renovation work was started in late 2011 and will be completed in two phases. The first phase was scheduled to be completed by June 15, 2012, and is said to cost about ₹50 lakhs. There are also plans to illuminate the monument, both from inside and outside, and to give the monument a fresh coat of paint. In the second phase a temporary folding stage will be set up at the foot of the 48-metre (157 ft) tall monument to avoid congestion at the Dorina Crossing during rallies.\n\nAfter the work is completed, both tourists and locals will have access to the top of the monument. Stalls selling souvenirs will also be set up just in front of the monument, while the pathways leading to it will be cleaned and decorated with flowering plants."

The juicy sausages, perfectly done eggs, hash browns, and buttered toast make for a hearty plate. Their freshly brewed coffee complements the meal perfectly.\n\nThe ambience is elegant and nostalgic, adding charm to the experience. It’s slightly pricey, but worth it for the quality and the vibe."

Half of its craze is due to its famous English breakfast and the nostalgia around it but even then the prices are a little high. Pastries are just unreasonably highly priced, you can get the same things with the same/better quality with much lower prices at other places in Kolkata.\n\nThe coffee & especially affogato was great 👍🏻 Highly visit during Christmas or better on New Year's Day to ditch the crowd & enjoy the decorations in peace. It generally is always bustling and busy with crowds at nearly all hours of the day."

Unfortunately, it was closed down in early 80’s due to some property dispute. The Nanking Restaurant was favorite of many popular Bollywood stars like Raj Kapoor, Sunil Dutt, Dilip Kumar and also famous Bengali author Sunil Ganguly was a frequent goer. The God is installed here is Kuandee, God of Warrior, holding a big knife. A big sized lord Buddha is installed in the ground floor. One Chinese news paper still publish from Kolkata that I saw for the first time here."

While parts of the house remain residential, the rest is open to the public (with prior permission). It's a rare window into 19th-century aristocratic Bengal, filled with marble floors, chandeliers, antique clocks, grand statues, Western and Indian paintings, and even a private zoo.\n\nUnlike modern museums, this place isn’t polished or curated — it’s a time capsule. Dusty, grand, mysterious, and unforgettable.\n\n🖼️ Interior Attractions & Collection\nArt Collection:\n\nPaintings by European masters like Rubens, Murillo, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Titian\n\nIndian artists like Raja Ravi Varma\n\nA gallery of sculptures, including busts of Greek gods, Queen Victoria, and Napoleon\n\nMany items are originals and rare, though some may be disputed reproductions\n\nFurniture & Decor:\n\nLuxurious Victorian-era furniture\n\nHuge Belgian glass mirrors, grand chandeliers\n\nAntique clocks, urns, vases, and stained-glass windows\n\nArchitecture:\n\nOver 90 varieties of marble from Italy and India\n\nLavish courtyards, open halls, and winding staircases\n\nCorinthian pillars and rococo flourishes contrast with the Bengal-style interiors\n\nPrivate Zoo / Aviary:\n\nIndia’s first private zoo (now more like a bird sanctuary)\n\nYou can spot peacocks, hornbills, toucans, deer, storks, and other exotic species in the gardens\n\n📷 Photography & Entry Policy\nPhotography is strictly prohibited, even outside the building\n\nEntry is free, but you must get a written permit from the West Bengal Tourism Information Bureau at BBD Bagh at least one day before\n\nGuided tours are compulsory – a member of the household or staff usually accompanies you\n\n⏰ Timings\nOpen: 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM\n\nClosed: Mondays and Thursdays\n\nVisit duration: ~1.5 to 2 hours for a full tour of the museum and garden\n\n✅ Positives\nRich, Rare Collection\nThe blend of Western art with Indian tradition makes this place unlike any other palace or museum in India.\n\nAuthentic Ambience\nIt’s not renovated in a modern way — and that’s what makes it atmospheric. It's a little dusty and faded, but that adds to the antique charm.\n\nCalm & Offbeat\nCompared to touristy places, it’s quiet and crowd-free, making it perfect for a reflective visit.\n\nArchitecture\nThe stunning marble work, pillars, and symmetrical structure make it a favorite for history and design lovers.\n\n⚠️ Negatives\nPermit Process\nGetting the entry permit is inconvenient and may discourage spontaneous visitors. You can’t just walk in.\n\nStrict No-Photography Rule\nNot being able to capture the visual richness can be frustrating for modern-day tourists.\n\nLimited Accessibility\nNo ramps or lifts; not suitable for wheelchairs or elderly people with mobility issues.\n\nLack of Professional Museum Experience\nSome artifacts aren’t labelled, and the guided tour is informal. Don't expect modern museum curation or A/V displays.\n\nMaintenance Issues\nSome visitors feel the place needs better upkeep — dusty galleries, poor lighting in areas, and wear on antiques are common complaints.\n\n🧭 How to Reach\nNearest Metro: Girish Park (10–12 minutes walk)\n\nBus/Auto/Taxi: Located in a narrow North Kolkata lane; easiest to reach via cab or app-based ride\n\nParking: Very limited; not recommended to drive a private vehicle"

The site is well maintained by the descendants of Raja Rajendra Mullick. The palace was built as an art museum and preserved ever since. From marble mosaic flooring, rosewood sculpture, brass statues, marble sculptures, oriental crockery and vase to victorian furniture, chandeliers, candle holders- it is an art collector's heaven. I went on a rainy day, the zoo was closed at the moment but i got to see various bird collection inside the palace. The upper floor was off limits as well due to some renovation. I can't wait to visit again."

Established in the 18th century by Raja Nabakrishna Deb, a key figure in Kolkata’s early history, this grand mansion has witnessed everything from British colonial soirées to Durga Puja celebrations that date back over 250 years.\nThe Rajbari’s famous Durga Puja, first organized in 1757 after the Battle of Plassey, is one of the oldest and most prestigious in Kolkata. Legend has it that Lord Clive himself attended the puja as part of his efforts to win over Bengal’s elite. Unlike modern pujas, the idol follows the \"Daaker Saaj\" tradition, adorned with shimmering silver foil, reflecting the regal aura of the Deb family.\nArchitecturally, the massive courtyard (Thakur Dalan), towering pillars, and faded yet elegant Indo-European design transport visitors to an era when zamindars dictated Kolkata’s social and cultural landscape. Despite the passage of time, the Rajbari remains an active center for heritage events, attracting history buffs and culture lovers alike.\nInteresting fact: The Sovabazar Raj family played a crucial role in the Bengal Renaissance, with stalwarts like Raja Radhakanta Deb championing social reforms and education.\nVerdict: A timeless gateway into Bengal’s regal past.\nPro tip — Visit during the Durga Puja to witness the magic of age-old traditions, where history and devotion merge in the grandest fashion."

There were so many beautiful pandals here but if you ask about a \"Bonedi Bari Durga Pujo\" then every Kolkata person would say ''Sovabazar Rajbari\" .\n\nOne of the oldest Durga Puja of North Kolkata. This was the Royal Palace of Raja Nabakridhna Dev in the 1700s.\n\nHeritage place of Kolkata. These are the place where our Bangali Traditional Culture is still alive. It was the place where civic reception was organised for Swami Vivekanand after his returning from Chicago."

He was Lord Clive's trusted Muncie. Many say that Raja Nabakrishna Dev's puja was the victory festival of the Battle of Palashi.\n\nWhen you come here, you can see two pujas of their two houses, one on the north side of the road where the puja started from 1757 (he gave the responsibility of this puja to his adopted son Gopi Mohan) and the house on the south side of the road started the Durga Puja from 1790 (he gave the responsibility of this puja to his biological son Rajkrishna Dev).\n\nIt was here that the first civics reception of Swami Vivekananda after his return from Chicago Parliament of Religions was organised in 1897 by Raja Binoy Deb Bahadur.\n\nThe distance of this Rajbari is only 270 meters from Gate No. 3 of Sobhabazar Sutanuti Metro Station. Which you can easily walk to."

The food was delicious, with a great mix of flavors, and the cocktails were expertly crafted. The service was warm and attentive, adding to the overall experience. Whether you’re looking for a relaxed evening with friends or a lively night out, this place has it all. Highly recommend!\n\never, while the place is quite happening, the DJ arrangement could use some improvement. The dance floor in front of the DJ is just okay, but the music selection feels outdated and lacks the energy needed to keep the crowd engaged. Updating the playlist with more trendy and upbeat tracks could significantly enhance the vibe. Definitely a lot of scope to improve on this front!"

I wouldn't call it a speakeasy because it is too easily discoverable and the interiors are big with upbeat music. The lighting is great and so is the seating. The servers are really polite. They have an outdoor space as well, for smoking. A DJ started playing after 8; one of the servers told me they have live bands on Thursdays and Fridays. I loved the varied seating, they have kept all group sizes in mind.\nI tried their signature cocktails: Are You In Cal, I've never had Alpenliebe washed vodka before, but it went well with caramel, coffee and spiced milk liqueur; Hello Stranger, Matcha went fantastic with coconut milk and Japanese whiskey, especially the Matcha wafer; Friday, 7 PM, gondhoraj was matched cleverly with gin and vermouth; For Old Times Sake, gin and amaro go well especially when sesame and coconut oil are involved; Dude, Put Your Shirt On, I've never had scotch paired with Kulfi, but the subtlety paid off; The Stage Is Set, sake, red cabbage tequila, aloe vera and olive brine is a mixture I've never had before, was a bit salty for my taste but not bad; Pop Goes The Daisy, coriander oil and gherkin aren't usual ingredients for a cocktail but with tequila they went really well. I loved the way they had presented their cocktail menu, each item had a small backstory leading up to its name.\nWe tried the small plates as well: Silk Road Seekh, Stir Fried Crispy Hunan Chicken, Spicy Chicken and Leek; they were all pretty good.\nWe finished up with the Dark Chocolate Tart and it was simply delicious.\nThe prices are quite high but that's to be expected from a place like this. I would highly recommend this place. Needless to say, we were just a little bit sober when we left!"

The staff was well-behaved and attentive, ensuring a smooth experience.\n\nThe food was tasty, but the portion sizes felt small compared to the high prices. Additionally, the coffee was over-extracted, likely due to old beans, and there was no cappuccino option on the menu. It would be great if they introduced more café-style items like croissants and brownies, which pair well with coffee. A complimentary cookie with coffee would also enhance the experience.\n\nA few improvements could be made, such as adding a washbasin on the first floor for convenience and serving cutlery with meals. Introducing gluten-free options in the menu would also be a welcome addition.\n\nOverall, a good place with potential, but a few refinements would make it even better."

The white marble architecture looks stunning, especially during sunrise or sunset when the light hits the domes. The vast gardens around it are well-maintained and perfect for a peaceful walk or to sit and relax.\n\nInside, the museum offers a fascinating glimpse into colonial history, with impressive paintings, artifacts, and sculptures. The collection is quite large, so it’s worth taking your time to explore each gallery.\n\nDo plan to spend at least 2–3 hours here to fully enjoy both the museum and the surrounding gardens. There’s also a light and sound show in the evening that brings the history of the memorial to life.\n\nOverall, a must-visit place in Kolkata that combines history, architecture, and nature beautifully!"

So it is nice to visit the place.\nThey have an entry fee for the garden and a different entry fee for the museum.\nThe gardens are nice to stroll and soak in the greenery.\nThey have a small pond as well.\nIt is good patch of green right in middle of the city.\nThey have good connections via local bus and metro.\nThe metro is about 400-500 meters away.\nThey have plenty of shops outside the gate.\nThey also have strict policy of foodstuffs being allowed into the museum area.\nThe gardens have a restroom as well.\nPlan to have a good walk and so have good shoes and also carry umbrella as if it rains then it’s bad and if it’s too sunny as well it gets bad."

It’s got everything—gorgeous lakes, vibrant gardens, and even mini Seven Wonders to snap pics with (just INR 30 to see ‘em)! 🚤 Boating’s a blast (INR 50–300), and I love renting a cycle (INR 70–150) to zip around. The musical fountain at night? Total magic! 🌟\n\nIt’s super family-friendly, though I wish there were more kid facilities. Everyone from toddlers to grandparents can enjoy it, but it’s not the best for wheelchairs. The park’s pretty eco-conscious with solar lights and recycling, but those plastic food stall cups bug me. ♻️ Entry’s only INR 30 (kids INR 15), and most activities are dirt cheap. Go early to dodge the weekend crowds! Pack water, sunscreen, and maybe a picnic—Eco Park’s perfect for making memories! 😄"

Spread across a vast area, it offers something for everyone—beautiful gardens, themed zones, a large lake, and plenty of open space to relax or take a long walk. The landscaping is well-maintained and the variety of attractions, like the replicas of the Seven Wonders and boating on the lake, make it an ideal spot for both families and solo visitors. I especially enjoyed the peaceful vibe away from the city’s hustle. It’s a great place to unwind, click pictures, or just spend time close to nature. Clean, spacious, and thoughtfully designed—definitely worth a visit!"

For seven wonders you can get a entry for Rs 30. Also a huge rain forests area can be ur attraction. Mist garden is another attraction. Boating specially during evening is attractive after lights come out. Island and solar done is added attraction. But need to have patience for walking."

The greenery, clean walkways, and well-arranged sitting areas make it equally enjoyable for morning walkers and evening strollers. Food stalls inside the park serve quick snacks and beverages, ensuring visitors don’t need to step out for refreshments.\n\nEntry fees are reasonable, and the place is well-managed with proper security and cleanliness.

The golden light reflects off the still waters of the lake, painting the entire scene in warm hues of orange and pink. Birds return to their nests, their silhouettes dancing across the sky, while some glide just above the water, creating ripples in the calm surface.\n\nFamilies stroll along the tree-lined paths, some laughing, some simply soaking in the quiet. Children play near the benches, and couples find quiet corners to sit and talk. Occasionally, you’ll spot kayakers gently paddling across the lake, their boats cutting through the sunset’s reflection like brushstrokes on a canvas.\n\nIt’s not just a park—it’s a breath of fresh air, a reminder of how beautiful moments can still exist in the heart of a busy city. Whether you’re here for a peaceful walk, to take photos, or to simply sit and watch nature do its thing, evenings at Rabindra Sarovar offer a rare kind of calm that stays with you long after you leave."

The ride was smooth and enjoyable, and the ticket price was incredibly affordable—just Rs. 6 for a one-way trip, making it a great value for money.\n\nThe park itself is a nice place to relax by the river, but the atmosphere was quite humid, which made it a bit uncomfortable to stay for long, especially during the day. Despite that, it's a good spot for a quick outing, and the boat ride alone makes it worth visiting."

The shabby ticket counter called upon us to remind of its golden busy days. Broken things although looks sad has their own way of showing beauty, that it is okay to let go and hold onto the memories buried in the crevices. The trees were happy though, the leaves getting to dance upon the drizzle. We had a good time with everything."

As the sun begins to dip, the park blushes in gold. Trees glow, the Hooghly shimmers, and the city gently slows its pace. In these golden hours, the park unveils its quiet magic.\n\nThe air turns softer, laughter warmer, and even silence feels romantic. Couples find cozy corners, steps grow slower, and hearts sync with the sunset. With the majestic river flowing beside and Howrah Bridge bathed in amber light, it’s a moment that belongs in poetry.\n\nPerfectly couple-friendly, the park offers breezy walkways, inviting benches, and peaceful views made for long conversations. That view of the setting sun behind the bridge? Pure magic.\n\nWhether you’re walking hand in hand, watching the sky change, or just soaking it all in—Millennium Park at golden hour is Kolkata’s softest love story.A must-visit for romantic souls and golden-hour chasers."

The view of the Hooghly River, especially during sunset, is breathtaking. Whether you're on a casual walk, enjoying a boat ride, or simply sitting by the riverside, the atmosphere is calm and refreshing. The white Palladian-style monument is beautifully maintained and adds a historical charm.\n\nEvenings are vibrant with street food vendors, local musicians, and couples strolling hand in hand. It's a perfect blend of nature, history, and local life. The surrounding gardens are clean, and the nearby railway station makes it easily accessible.\n\nHighly recommend visiting if you're in Kolkata — don’t forget your camera, the views are picture-perfect!"

              "reviewText": "Princep Ghat is one of Kolkata’s most iconic landmarks and a must-visit destination for both locals and tourists. Located along the banks of the Hooghly River, it beautifully combines history, architecture, and natural beauty. Built in 1843 in memory of the British scholar James Prinsep, the structure boasts stunning colonial-style design and is surrounded by lush green gardens, making it an ideal spot for relaxation and photography. The place is especially charming during the evenings when the Vidyasagar Setu, which looms majestically overhead, is lit up, creating a magical atmosphere.\n\nVisitors can enjoy peaceful walks along the riverbank, take a boat ride for a mesmerizing view of the sunset, or simply sit and watch the gentle flow of the Hooghly. Street food stalls nearby offer delicious local snacks, adding to the experience. It’s also a favorite spot for couples, families, and photographers due to its scenic charm. The area is well-maintained, with clean surroundings and proper seating arrangements.\n\nReaching Princep Ghat is easy, as it is well-connected by road and even has a nearby railway station. Early mornings and evenings are the best times to visit, as you can witness the golden hues of sunrise or sunset reflecting on the water. Whether you’re looking for a peaceful escape, a place to unwind, or a spot to soak in Kolkata’s heritage, Princep Ghat offers it all. Highly recommended for a serene and memorable experience in the city."

Fitzgerald and built in 1843 in memory of the eminent Anglo-Indian scholar and antiquarian James Prinsep.\n\nNote for tourists :\nPrincep Ghat and its surroundings are really beautiful. Especially the view of Vidyasagar Bridge from this ghat adds extra charm. This place is also considered as a shooting spot. This place is a great place for couples.\nYou can enjoy a comfortable boat ride at Princep Ghat in Kolkata. If you are a couple or with friends or family, you can rent an entire boat for yourself. You need to fix the boat rent before riding."

There's a walkway that runs parallel to the Ganga — perfect for a leisurely stroll, a heart-to-heart chat, or even just some quiet reflection with the breeze in your hair and the holy river beside you.\n\nThe ghats aren’t continuous so you can't differentiate them (math joke). In fact, the statement is entirely opposite in English. You can differentiate only when they are not continuous. Strange subjects!\n\nScattered along the way are small eateries and chai stalls, perfect for grabbing a snack or sipping a hot cup of tea while watching the the river at the end of its more than 2k km journey."

The only 2 bad things are photography is prohibited and the park stays open only from 1 to 4 PM in the afternoon which is a odd time. Specially on summer days. Anyways despite the no photography allowed people were still taking pics and all so I took some shots as well,  it'd okish to be there if you are in the area its a normal park and since it closes off at 4 you cant spend the evening there."

              "reviewText": "An oasis in the heart of Kolkata—Elliot Park is where the city slows down and breathes.\n\nTucked just behind Tata Centre and a 2-minute stroll from Maidan Metro Station, Elliot Park is one of those rare green pockets that balances urban buzz with serene calm. Whether you’re escaping office stress, walking off a heavy lunch from Park Street, or just craving silence in the city—this place delivers.\n\nWhy Elliot Park stands out 🌿\n\n1. Immaculately maintained: The walking tracks are clean, the lawns are manicured, and the benches are never too crowded. A welcome surprise, especially in central Kolkata!\n\n2. Perfect for walkers and joggers: The circular path is wide, shaded, and ideal for early morning jogs or evening strolls. You’ll find fitness enthusiasts, seniors, and college students all vibing in harmony.\n\n3. Green escape with skyline views: While you enjoy the chirping birds and tall trees, the distant silhouette of downtown Kolkata peeks through—best of both worlds.\n\n4. Safe and peaceful: Entry is free but secure. It feels family-friendly, with couples, kids, and elderly visitors all coexisting without any nuisance.\n\nExtras that make it special:\n\nPhotography alert: Visit around 4:30–5:30 PM for golden light filtering through the trees—ideal for portraits or casual reels.\n\nProximity bonus: Maidan Metro, Victoria Memorial, and St. Paul’s Cathedral are all within walking distance. Makes for a beautiful half-day circuit.\n\nNo hawkers inside = clean experience. But don’t worry—there’s always a bhel puri or tea stall right outside the gates when hunger hits.\n\nHeads-up ⚠️\n\nClosed on Mondays for maintenance.\n\nNo food or loud music allowed—this is a calm space, not a picnic ground.\n\nLimited shaded seating—carry a cap if you're visiting in the afternoon.\n\nLocal tip: Carry a book or some headphones and let the world slow down. If you’re a working professional, this is your go-to spot for a reset. If you’re a tourist, it’s the quiet pause you didn’t know you needed between Victoria and Park Street.\n\nElliot Park is proof that in the middle of chaos, Kolkata still has places that let you just... be.\n\nIf this review helped you find your new favorite spot, tap that 👍 Helpful button and show some love for the city's green lungs!"

              "reviewText": "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nNicco Park is without a doubt one of the best attractions in Kolkata for a fun-filled day with family and friends. From the moment you step inside, you’re greeted with a lively atmosphere, lush greenery, and well-organized pathways that make the entire park easy to explore. It truly lives up to its nickname — the \"Disneyland of the East.\"\n\nThe variety of rides here is impressive. Whether you’re an adventure seeker who loves high-speed roller coasters and the Cyclone ride, or someone who prefers calmer experiences like the cable car or toy train, there’s something for everyone. The park maintains high safety standards, and you can see staff actively ensuring that rides are operated smoothly and securely.\n\nThe Water Park section is a highlight in itself — perfect for cooling off on a warm day. The wave pool, water slides, and lazy river are all well-maintained and super fun. Kids absolutely love the splash zones, and adults can enjoy the slides just as much.\n\nAnother great thing about Nicco Park is the cleanliness. You’ll find dustbins at regular intervals, and the staff are quick to keep the area neat. There are also plenty of food stalls offering everything from snacks to full meals, with both local and international options. The prices are reasonable for the quality and convenience.\n\nIt’s not just about rides — Nicco Park also has beautiful gardens, a small aquarium, and various fun activities that make it more than just an amusement park. You can easily spend an entire day here without feeling bored.\n\nOverall, Nicco Park offers excellent value for money and delivers an experience that’s enjoyable for people of all ages. It’s a must-visit in Kolkata if you’re looking for adventure, entertainment, and a bit of nostalgia all in one place."

The main amusement park has some exciting rides and scenic spots, and the water park is definitely a highlight, especially during the summer.\n\nHowever, it can get very crowded on weekends, especially in the water park section. Be prepared for long queues for most of the popular rides. If you're planning a visit, weekdays might be a better option for a more relaxed experience.\n\nThe food at the café inside was surprisingly good—fresh and tasty with decent options for both snacks and meals. One thing to note is that basic items like bottled water are sold at a premium—a 1-liter bottle costs ₹50, which feels a bit overpriced.\n\nOverall, Nicco Park offers a memorable day out, especially for families, but planning ahead and visiting on a less busy day can make a big difference."

              "reviewText": "Nicco Park is by far the best amusement park in Kolkata. I’ve visited countless places in the city, but none have given me such consistent joy throughout the entire day. The park is very well maintained as it is clean, organized, and run with great attention to detail. The staff are always friendly, helpful, and attentive to safety, which makes the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nWith nearly 40–45 attractions to explore, there’s something for everyone. I recommend booking tickets online in advance and opting for the combo with the waterpark entry; it usually costs around ₹1200 year-round, and you can sometimes find special offers at about ₹600. Do keep in mind that food, certain rides, games, lockers, and bowling are charged separately.\n\nFor the best experience, plan to arrive early (around 11 AM) so you have enough time to enjoy all the rides. If you’re visiting the Wet-o-Wild waterpark, make sure to bring synthetic clothing as required. The only downside is the food—the options at the food courts are consistently disappointing, so don’t expect much in that department.\n\nThat said, whether you’re with friends, family, or a partner, Nicco Park guarantees a day full of thrill, adventure, and plenty of laughter. It’s the perfect place for anyone looking to create fun and memorable experiences."

The only scary ride was the Tornado (the roller coaster). All other rides were enjoyable without any fear even, the Sky dive was not that scary.  Still we had a great time.

It houses an incredible collection of artifacts from ancient times, including sculptures, fossils, coins, textiles, and more. The Egyptian mummy and the grand Buddhist galleries are particularly fascinating.\n\nThe museum is quite large, so give yourself at least 2–3 hours to explore it properly. It can get a little warm inside during summer months, so I recommend visiting in winter for a more comfortable experience. Overall, it's an enriching and educational experience that offers a glimpse into India’s vast and diverse heritage."

The collection is vast and incredibly diverse, showcasing historic items and antiques from across time and geography. The star attraction is the 4000 year old Egyptian mummy in the Egypt Gallery, which is truly fascinating. Apart from that, the museum also houses remarkable Buddhist archaeological treasures from Gandhara (present-day Kandahar, Afghanistan), along with fascinating galleries on fossils, zoology, birds, geology and what not. The Botany Survey of India is also part of this museum, adding to its richness and diversity. I would recommend keeping at least 2–3 hours aside to explore properly. This museum is a journey through both history and culture, and an absolute must visit."

Walking through its grand halls felt like stepping into a time machine-rich with history, knowledge, and artistic beauty. I was deeply impressed by the vast collection and the way everything was preserved and presented.\n\nAs someone with a love for history and culture, this visit was both inspiring and educational. I captured some memorable photos during my tour, but the real magic is something you have to experience in person.\n\nIf you’re ever in Kolkata, a visit to the Indian Museum is an absolute must. Whether you’re a curious traveler or a history enthusiast, you’ll leave with a deeper appreciation of South Asia’s rich heritage."

Walking through the ground floor of the museum it might appear that the people of the past weren't less intellect than us and even their appetite exceeds ours in some cases. The magnificent stone work would left the viewer speechless. No need to buy tickets in advance and  interestingly buying a photography ticket one can get permission of taking photos almost all the things though rate is different for mobile camera and digital cameras."

Don't expect for hygenic breakfast or lunch there! No outside packages allowed in the premises! Good place for nature lovers or if anybody wants to spend some time beside ganges...though it's guarded. So many old buildings and offices are still there which will give  horrific views. The main Banyan tree is not there..it's braches are there now..and they are too far from the main gate.

The chef went back in and prepared another one which was then cooked right but the portion was reduced. The Stroganoff was not too great either and the portion served was horribly small. The pork chops were dry. Very disappointed with the food. Food is not worth the money. The ambience is good though and the table service too."

The spread is excellent—delicious omelets, perfectly made French toast, fresh cakes, crunchy granola, flavorful dosa, and even puchka! Everything about the experience feels just right. The live counters offer great variety and the chefs do a fantastic job delivering taste and presentation.\n\nWhat really sets the experience apart is the service—Mehak and her team are attentive and warm, creating a welcoming environment each morning. Special mention to Purtha, who is always on the move and has a sharp eye for customer needs.\n\nThe attention to detail from the entire staff is commendable.\n\nThe Bridge has become a favorite and I’ll definitely be returning again and again.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone visiting Kolkata."

They have not cleared the starter menu options. Every time asked for the next. The waste plate clear after the calling. All staff are moving here are there showing artificial business.\nAmbiance: Very conjugated with noisy atmosphere and loud live music. The area was too small.\nFood: Starter options were very limited. They offered to choose Veg/Non-Veg. Chat counter have only 3 choice with very ordinary taste. They have no Asian/Chinese Section. Only one live counter. In main course, Non-Veg only 3 options. No icecream in dessert, also not to spread.\nTaste: Only few items are maintaing the quality, most of other below average.\nMy opinion: This kind of Food options and pathetic service never deserve a 5 star catagory tag.

              "reviewText": "The Howrah Bridge, officially known as Rabindra Setu, is not just a bridge—it is a living icon of Kolkata and one of the most remarkable engineering marvels of India. Standing proudly over the Hooghly River, this cantilever bridge connects the city of Howrah with the heart of Kolkata, carrying millions of people every single day.\n\nWhat makes the Howrah Bridge truly fascinating is its sheer scale and design. Built without a single nut or bolt, it is held together entirely by rivets, a testament to the brilliance of early 20th-century engineering. Walking or driving across it, you can feel the pulse of the city—the endless flow of buses, yellow taxis, rickshaws, and pedestrians all weaving into the daily rhythm of Kolkata life.\n\nBeyond its practical importance, the bridge has immense cultural and emotional value. For many Bengalis, the first glimpse of the Howrah Bridge while entering Kolkata symbolizes “homecoming.” At night, when the bridge lights up and reflects on the waters of the Hooghly, it transforms into a breathtaking sight—one that photographers and travelers cherish.\n\nThe Howrah Bridge is more than just steel and structure; it is a silent witness to Kolkata’s history, from the days of British India to modern times. It has seen generations grow, countless stories unfold, and remains one of the busiest bridges in the world.\n\nIf you are visiting Kolkata, experiencing the Howrah Bridge—whether by walking across it, viewing it from the ghats, or taking a ferry ride underneath—is an absolute must. It is not only an engineering wonder but also the very soul of the city."

The view of the Hooghly River from the bridge is beautiful during sunrise or sunset.\n3. At night, the lights on the bridge give it a nice glow.\n4. It connects the busy Howrah Railway Station with Kolkata city, so it's historically important.\n5. For people interested in raw city life, walking across it feels like stepping into Kolkata’s real daily rhythm.\n\n🔴What I didn’t like (and others should know)🔴\n\n6. The surrounding area is one of the dirtiest I’ve seen — garbage, spit, urine — it’s everywhere.\n7. It’s overcrowded with honking traffic, vendors, and people rushing in every direction.\n8. No one follows traffic rules, and there’s zero lane discipline.\n9. Ola and taxi drivers around the area are known for overcharging, refusing to turn on the AC, and behaving rudely.\n10. If you still want to go, visit early morning or late evening — it's slightly better and less crowded then."

There was buffet system. They offered a lot of cuisines in the starters itself (starting from Indian chicken kebabs to Chinese and even to Italian pasta) 🤩😋🤤. A drinks counter was also there.. The main course was okay and good.\nThe lawn is so big that apart from the dining setup, a huge space was left out for guests to dance, chat and enjoy!\n\nThe staffs seemed a bit amateurish but they were polite and well behaved.\n\nThe decoration was so beatiful and dreamy😍😍🫠 May it be the hall or the open lawn or the surrounding space..

The food was below average and insufficient and was too pricey, literally robbing customers wallets. We took Chicken and Veg fried rice as main course and Prawn as a starter. The mushroom was not fresh which was in the chicken gravy. The experience was the worst out of all the restaurants I visited till date. The staff literally told me to clean the plate before serving new items, the staff are unprofessional and have no manners. NO ONE SHOULD  VISIT THIS RESTAURANT IN LIFE. Visit at your own risk.

Now, I tried the Chinese restaurant of Cafe Ekante. The interiors of the place is fine, but filled with mosquitoes. The behavior of the staff isn't that great.\n\nComing to the food, we tried Chilli baby corn which was good, nothing extraordinary. Next was the Red Chilli fish, I loved this. The fish was really tender and the sauce was very tasty. We also tried the Chicken wings was was below average. Lastly, we had the Chilli Chicken in schezwan sauce, Chicken Hakka Noodles and Chicken Fried Rice. Noodles was amazing, realllyyyy good. The other two were quite basic. Also, they were out of Mocktails.\n\nAll mains and starters are prepared in the same sauce. So they basically taste similar. Overall it's good for the view, food isn't worth it."

              "reviewText": "Cafe ekante is quite a famous place to dine-in.\nLet's get into the groove and discuss a bit.\n\nIt has two sections:\nA Chinese special section that is on a house boat\nAnd a Bengali food/ others in a restaurant. Both are quite adjacent to one another.\n\nAlso they have specific timings. Separate for evening snacks and dinner if u want to go for the Bengali food section. Starts from 7pm in eve. I think lunch is from 12-4 approx and in between it snacks.\n\nNow for review:\nFood : 3.5/5\nWill not say it's super delicious. It's average. Fish items specially can improve a bit. As of chicken and mutton, I found it as per standard. I must suggest that you try their dov-chingri as it really caught the true blend of the dish.\n\nAmbience: 5/5\nGo on evening. That's one suggestion from me and I promise u won't regret. The whole setting is just mesmerising and beautiful if u go for a dinner. It can be romantic as well as family oriented too.\n\nService : 4/5\nService was good. There was this lad who really was very welcoming and timely. We ordered in intervals and took our time but they were patient and kept good behavior all throughout.\n\nU can go visit but overall I found it very expensive. Not justified to pay so much for the dishes on the menu. U will be paying for the place more than the food and if that's okay with you, go ahead."

              "reviewText": "If cricket had a Heaven in India, then Eden Gardens would be it. This isn’t just a stadium — it’s an emotion, a coliseum where legends are made, dreams are shattered, and 66,000+ voices chant in unison, shaking the very ground. Established in 1864, Eden Gardens is India’s oldest and second-largest cricket stadium, often called the “Lords of the East” (but let’s be honest, even Lord’s can’t match the madness of an India-Pakistan match here!).\nThe roar of the crowd when Sourav Ganguly waved his shirt at Lord’s? That energy was born here. Sachin’s records, Dhoni’s helicopter shots, and Kolkata Knight Riders’ IPL triumphs? All celebrated under Eden’s floodlights.\nBut Eden Gardens isn’t just about cricket. The Maidan surrounding it is Kolkata’s green lung, where footballers, morning walkers, and political rallies coexist in perfect chaos. Nearby, the Rabindra Sadan-Nandan cultural complex fuels Bengal’s love for theatre and films, while the Mohan Bagan, Mohammedan Sporting and East Bengal football clubs remind you that Kolkata’s second religion is football.\nAnd then there’s the Eden Gardens Park, a serene escape with a picturesque lake, along with the pagoda, perfect for a quiet evening stroll (assuming you aren’t still hoarse from screaming at a match).\nVerdict: Whether you love cricket or just the thrill of history, Eden Gardens is a must-visit.\nPro tip — Catch a live match here; the energy is electric, and the crowd could out-cheer a rock concert!"

              "reviewText": "Eden Gardens – The Mecca of Indian Cricket!\nLocated in the Maidan area near BBD Bagh, right opposite the Calcutta High Court, this is a legendary venue that resonates deeply with the soul of cricket.\n\nI have visited the stadium five times, and among those, the first-ever pink-ball Day-Night Test match between India and Bangladesh left a lasting impact on me. The stadium, with an approximate seating capacity of 68,000, was packed to the brim that day. During the event, I had a brief conversation with a ground staff member who shared info that the boundary dimensions are approximately 66–68 meters on the square side and 76–78 meters on the straight side.\n\nThe stands inside the stadium are named after cricketing legends such as Sourav Ganguly, Pankaj Roy, and Jagmohan Dalmiya. The B.C. Roy Club House named in honor of former West Bengal Chief Minister Dr. B.C. Roy.\n\nWhile attending matches, you might experience cellular connectivity issues due to the presence of signal jammers. However, vendors selling water and snacks are quite efficient. There are also food corners and canteens inside the stadium offering decent food, albeit at higher-than-usual prices.\n\nOne area that consistently falls short is crowd management. In my experience, the gathering process lacks professionalism. A stadium of such iconic status should ideally have more streamlined crowd-control mechanisms.\n\nFor your information I want to let you know that Eden Gardens is owned by the Eastern Command of the Indian Army and managed by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), whose headquarters are within the stadium complex.\n\nTo me, it isn’t just a cricket stadium, it’s a living monument to the sport in India. With a history spanning over 160 years, electrifying crowds, iconic matches, and a rich architectural legacy, it remains the heartbeat of cricketing culture and heritage in Kolkata and across the globe."

Though everything was set, but a disappointing game from the home team had left us leaving the stands with a heavy heart 💔\n\nThe Eden gardens has improved over time with washrooms and stands renovated, still the dirty washrooms are a major concern (with basins flooded)\n\nAlso the seats could be more cleaner. Else everything was fine.\n\nIndeed it is \"The Colosseum of Indian Cricket\", The Mecca of Cricket\" ❤️🫶🏻"

              "reviewText": "South Park Street Cemetery (a.k.a. Park Street Cemetery) — where Kolkata’s colonial past rests in peace (literally) and history peeks through layers of moss and mist. Established in 1767, this is one of the oldest non-church cemeteries in the world, a silent witness to the city’s British-era grandeur. Forget horror movies — this place is less \"The Conjuring\" and more \"Downton Abbey meets The Jungle Book\", with gothic tombs draped in banyan roots and squirrels darting between centuries-old epitaphs.\nAmong the notable “residents” here are Sir William Jones, the founder of the Asiatic Society, and Rose Aylmer, the muse of poet Walter Savage Landor (whose love for her was so deep, he wrote a poem that outlived empires). Many tombstones tell tales of lives cut short by tropical diseases, duels, and sometimes, just bad luck in 18th-century Kolkata.\nThe architecture is stunning — grand obelisks, pyramid-like tombs, and intricate carvings that scream Raj-era drama. And if you think cemeteries are spooky, try visiting on a foggy winter morning when the light filters through the trees — it’s eerily beautiful.\nVerdict: A hauntingly poetic escape in the heart of Kolkata.\nPro tip — Carry a camera, read the inscriptions, and remember, in a city that never sleeps, even the departed have fascinating stories to tell. 🪦🌿📜"

Each faded inscription speaks of lives once vibrant, now mere whispers lost to time. These graves remind us of the transient nature of our journey—what does it mean to be remembered?\n\nAs I traced the weathered stones, I pondered whether significance lies in our deeds or the connections we make. This sacred space urged me to honor the past while reflecting on my own fleeting existence, reminding me that even the most ephemeral moments hold the potential for enduring meaning.\n\nWe are just leaves drying with the passage of time and proceeding everyday to the eternal non-existence!\n\nPlease don't damage the property and avoid littering, this should be preserved being a great essence to our British Colonial Past!\n\n🍂 🍁 🌾"

Anyways ,coming back to the review -\nFood - 5/5 It was so delicious both of the times I came here . Quite elegant serving .\n\nPrice : 4/5 A bit pricey I would say considering the serving size. We had a Chinese sizzler and mutton boti Kebab and one mocktail and a coffee ,the bill was 2k approx .\n\nService : 4/5 The last time I went there it wasn't crowded so service was a bit faster than this time .\n\nAmbience : 5/5 Quite beautiful interior . The music is soft during daytime .\n\nNote : I went there for lunch both of the times , they also have rooftop arrangements but it wasn't open at that time .\nAlso, they've quite a vast menu of drinks ,especially Alcoholic .\nI would totally recommend it because of the taste and ambience ."

              "reviewText": "Speaking strictly on the basis of novelty. A bar, restaurant and hookah parlor on a rooftop in the Middle of Park Street has massive brownie points on its own. But given such joints have cropped up in the dozens around town. The novelty seems to have lost it's sheen a bit. The food and service leaves a lot to be desired. BEWARE of a menu card with old rates. That hasn't been updated but still does the rounds. Baffling patrons as to why the their bill inflated like balloons. The hookah is average, the food is average, music is generic gastropub playlist. Nothing to write home about. Would have appreciated better pricing and better food. But then again it's park Street, nothing is cheap. For rooftop lovers I recommend Zucca lounge, Blue and Beyond, PPT. Even the hospitality is hundred times better."

I tried their signature dish dajaj chermoula, followed by red chilli prawns, blue frappe, baked fish wellington, kulcha and amritsari fish. All of them were presented beautifully and tasted perfect. Price range for one person is 600-800. A must go. Highly recommended."

The mocktail took a few minutes to chill properly, which was a little surprising. The nasi goreng came with wilted prawn crackers, and the chili chicken just didn’t hit the mark. One staff member did try to explain the sad state of crackers, but the explanation soon veered into smug territory. I am not the one to be impressed by overconfident explanations when the food doesn’t deliver."

The chat section, starters, the mutton, grilled fish, mediterranean section were really awesome. The dessert section was pretty good and almost everything tasted well. The walk to the poolside with a view of the Hyatt is also awesome. My pet peeve with them is their booking process. Both times booked through phone calls and found on arrival that my booking was not listed. This time I even mentioned last time's experience and was assured that nothing like that would happen again.

Though it was a buffet setup but they were also serving starters from live grill counter to table which was good as you don't have to stand in front of the grill.\nThe dessert section was also stacked up nicely having lots of items to offset your calorie count of couple of days.\nOverall a nice pleasant experience."

Their menu is restricted to just few options not much .\nWe ordered :\nHot N sour chicken soup  - 165/-  for full\nPaneer tikka just 4 medium sized pieces for 275/-\nTangdi Kebab - 3 piece for 385/-\norange blossom Mocktail which was white in color for 225/-\nAnd Kung Pao chicken Sizzler  for 425/-\n\nOnly the soup was in ample quantity sufficient for 2 people rest everything had a small portion . There was nothing extra ordinary about the Tangdi kebab and paneer tikka, just like some road side stall . Sizzler was OKAY , too much of sauce confusing ones palette .\n\nOverall it could be good for just one time visit that too if you are not a foodiee...\n\nWe asked the waiter to bring the soup and Paneer tikka first and then the other ones Later . But the waiter bought the Mocktail too with the hot items and soup .  Just then even after clear requests he bought the Sizzler within minutes before we could even finish the soup .\nPlease return back the food if they do so because sitting outside makes your waiting food cold and dusty .\n\nThe worst part is they are leveraging 18% GST on your bill which even some of the most renowned restaurants don't.\n\nWe booked through EazyDiner app so we got a good discount .\n\nOverall just an OKAY experience ."

The arrangement seems fine for refreshments or snacks but not appropriate for having lunch or dinner. The lighting seems to be a little less, lack of fan or cooling makes it miserable in hot and humid weather. 🥵 The pricing of the food is also slightly on the higher side although the food is very good. 👍\nWorth a visit if it is not too humid."

A restaurant can be known for its food but to find an establishment that has a combination of fine food, ambience, excellent service and attention to detail is a rare thing and the Guchhi Restaurant is one such gem. Let’s start with the restaurant manager Mr. Asif - a professional who knows his guests and his Team. He remembered us from our last visit which was about a year ago. I told him we were going to be entertaining our friends and family whom we had not met in over 40 years for the evening and he right away assigned us an excellent table and with help of his chefs - Chef Satnam and Chef Partha we created a set menu for the evening. Our guests were superbly impressed with the way the food was served in an elaborate sequence. The guests were further in awe when they tasted the Tawa Guchhi, tandoori broccoli, stuffed and grilled  aloos, Bengali fish, chicken makhani, dal Gucchi, paneer labbadar, the dry chrispy okra, raita, the assortments of achaars (especially papaya achar) and a selection of rotis, naans and parathas. The food flowed as if it was an endless supply and our friends were simply blown away with the high quality of the food and service. The guests were further amazed when a selection of delicate paans were served. To boot, the chefs made an appearance to meet our guests and our guests were able to express their sincere gratitude to the chefs for the delicious foods. All in all it was a lovely evening of fine food and great conversation in the comfort of a lovely restaurant. A big thank you to Mr. Asif and his Team. Give this place a shot, you won’t regret it."

Good place to hangout with friends. We often used to hangout here after our school was over. Ofcourse this place is a nostalgic place to me.

After downing a few chilled beers, the energy hit different – every throw felt like a celebration, every strike was a victory dance, and even the gutter balls had us in splits.\n\nThe place has a vibrant and energetic atmosphere – neon lights, great music, and a vibe that just screams fun. The lanes were smooth, the arcade games kept us pumped between rounds, and the staff was super chill and helpful.\n\nBowling with a buzz made it even more hilarious – from wild celebrations to competitive banter, the whole experience was pure gold. And the nearby food options made sure our beer-fueled hunger was taken care of.\n\nIf you’re looking to kick back, laugh loud, and make some unforgettable memories with friends, Nicco Super Bowl is the perfect strike zone. 10/10, would roll again. 🍺🎳🔥"

From bowling to air hockey, basketball, pool, and car racing video games, there’s something fun for everyone. The venue is well-maintained, with the bowling lanes being particularly impressive and in excellent condition. What really stands out, however, is how budget-friendly the charges are, making it an affordable choice for a day out.\n\nHere’s a breakdown of the pricing: The entry fee is just ₹100 per person. Bowling is only ₹150 for a 10-round game, and it’s shareable, so you can easily split the cost with friends. Other games like air hockey and basketball are priced at ₹60 for 3 minutes, while the pool table is available for ₹80 per 15 minutes.\n\nWith such reasonable prices, Nicco Super Bowl offers great entertainment without breaking the bank. Whether you're in the mood for a friendly bowling match or some competitive gaming, this venue has got you covered!"

Completed in 1847, it was the first Anglican cathedral built in Asia and remains the seat of the Diocese of Calcutta. Designed by Major William Nairn Forbes and architect C.K. Robinson, its towering spire, pointed arches, and stained-glass windows reflect a blend of Gothic Revival and Indian adaptations suited to the local climate. Located on Cathedral Road near Victoria Memorial and Birla Planetarium, the cathedral is surrounded by lush gardens and offers a serene retreat from the city’s bustle. Inside, visitors find a high-vaulted nave, intricate woodwork, and frescoes depicting the life of St. Paul."

The church 💒built by the British in the 1800s, is one of the most famous landmarks in the city.... From outside, it looks grand, and inside it is even more stunning. Photography 📸 isn’t allowed inside☹️, but it’s completely worth visiting for its peaceful atmosphere, beautiful🙂‍↔️❤🩷 stained glass windows..tall hall...and old carvings..... You can also see many things that remind us of the time before independence. There’s a small library with old books 📚and a lovely garden outside where you can sit and relax.✨️🧘‍♀️🧘‍♂️\n\nThe outside area is also very attractive.... During Christmas 🌲🎈✨️they put up Nativity scenes that tell the story of the birth of Jesus Christ... You can see statues of baby Jesus with Mary and Joseph, shepherds, angels, and animals. There are also statues of the Three Wise Men with camels, which look very colorful and detailed.... These decorations make the garden look lively and festive, and it feels peaceful to walk around and enjoy them...🌲🎈✨️\n\nIf you visit during Christmas, the church is beautifully decorated with lights, and the Midnight 🌃Mass is an unforgettable experience....❤️🩷\n\nOverall, St. Paul’s Cathedral is a must visit in Kolkata whether you love history, architecture, or just want to spend some calm and spiritual time....."

For just ₹10, you’re welcomed into a world of calm that feels miles away from the city’s buzz.\n\nThe architecture is a sight to behold-grand Gothic arches, lofty ceilings, and stained-glass windows that catch the light just right. It’s not about flashy photos here (they don’t allow them inside), but rather about the hush in the air, the stillness that settles over you the moment you step in.\n\nIt’s a place to reflect, to breathe, to simply sit and let time slow down. Whether you’re there for a prayer or just to marvel at the history, this cathedral has a quiet charm that stays with you.\n\nA soul-soothing stop, and one I’d recommend to anyone craving a bit of grace and serenity."

We spent a good amount of time there, enjoying some delicious food and great conversations. The atmosphere is vibrant, and it's the perfect spot to relax and catch up.\n\nThe game zone is another major attraction. The arcade games are exciting and kept us entertained for hours. It’s a great way to unleash your inner child and have some friendly competition with your buddies.\n\nOf course, the shopping experience is top-notch. We did a lot of window shopping, admiring the latest collections from a wide range of national and international brands. Whether you’re looking for high-end fashion or just some casual wear, this mall has it all.\n\nOverall, South City Mall offers a perfect blend of food, fun, and fashion. It's a must-visit destination for anyone looking for a great day out with friends or family. I highly recommend it to all fellow local guides and visitors!"

This picnic spot is not that beautiful or mesmerizing or well decorated. Even the ground is not that large . There is a huge parking place obviously chargeable. There is a house where lunch or tiffin is arranged. However, the picnic spot is so so . One can reach here from SALT LAKE SECTOR V METRO STATION."

The cafe has both open area as well as dine in area. We opted to sit outside under the evening sky and ordered their cappuccino\nThe coffee was decent\nWe then ordered their spaghetti carbonara along with patata frites. The spaghetti was delicious and the patata frites had a nice crunch and tasted fresh. The best part is that you can stay there as long as you want and spend some quality time with friends. The place has a hispter kind of vibe so I won't recommend to come with your family. Overall, a good cafe with a beautiful atmosphere."

Fair to say we enjoyed the tranquility and of course, the food.\n\nWe ordered the Chicken combo- which  was decent. The chicken was well seasoned and fried till GBD. The fries were crunchy, but the salad on the side could do with more dressing.\nWe also ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara which was delectable and the pasta was cooked al dente. The dish was one sprinkle parmesan short of a hearty and sumptuous meal (although, when is more cheese ever enough?).\nWe settled for an iced mocha to wash down our fair share of carbs, which rightly hit the spot.\n\nOverall, an experience that was made even better by the constant light to heavy drizzle outside.\n\nNo amount of funk or cool hangouts will ever  top the serendipity of having the entire cafe to ourselves on a rainy Saturday morning.\n\nTummy full, soul satisfied.\n\nGod bless chicken, potatoes, spaghetti, and cheese."

Also they serve one of the best breakfasts in the city, and are open from 8 in the morning. Prices are very reasonable, considering the items they offer and the kind of customers they get (mostly foreigners since there are many hotels nearby catering to international tourists).\nThey allow visitors to scribble on the walls with a permanent marker, and it makes for an unique setting. In the evenings there is a nice lively ambience when the place is full of Europeans and other world travelers. Only negatives are the lack of proper washroom and restroom facilities (they have this pretty basic and makeshift toilet and hand-washing space), and the lack of signs and directions leading to the café (it is almost 'hidden' in a small bylane away from the street).\nToday I had Tortilla De Patatas (potatoes wrapped in an omlette), Albondigas (meat balls) with fries, fresh watermelon juice, and black coffee with double shot of espresso (fully recommend - its the strongest coffee in town!). All for only ₹590."

The interior features contemporary decor, warm lighting, and comfortable seating, making it ideal for evening gatherings.\n\n**Service Quality**:\nWhile some guests appreciate the attentive staff, there are mixed reviews about service. Some mention professional service, while others highlight untrained staff and issues with drink preparation.\n\n**Food & Drink**:\nThe menu offers a variety of cuisines with flavorful dishes. However, feedback on drink quality varies, with some noting that cocktails lack expertise.\n\n**Cleanliness & Hygiene**:\nDetails on cleanliness are limited, but as a premium venue, it likely adheres to standard hygiene protocols.\n\n**Value for Money**:\nWhile prices reflect the premium setting and views, some feel the quality of service and drinks doesn't justify the cost.\n\n**Overall Experience**:\nOzora provides a unique dining experience with stunning views but mixed service and drink quality. It's worth visiting for special occasions, but experiences may vary."

We ordered two mocktails...one spicy mango drink and the other was bengal twist...gandhoraj mojito. Both were very refreshing. There was a set menu displayed on the table. So we ordered one continental set meal. The food was just average. Then we ordered pepperoni pizza. The pizza was just too good. Then we ordered one raspberry cheesecake and tiramisu for dessert. Both were ok. The place had great view of the city. The person serving Mr. Atish Barick was very knowledgeable about the menu. He was a pleasure to have as a steward. One thing though they had added service charge to the bill ."

The experience begins the moment you push open the large glass door, as you're welcomed by a breathtaking view of the cityscape.\n\nI went there with three friends for lunch. We ordered Korean Chilli Wings, a Pepperoni Rucola Pizza, and two glasses of fresh lime soda. The service was prompt, and it was impossible not to blurt out \"mmm, delicious\" after every bite. There's a bar right next to the dining area, which we youngsters didn’t venture into.\n\nThe ambience couldn't have been better—soft jazz playing in the background, the occasional clink of cutlery—it all came together so well. The bill came to slightly under Rs. 2000, which feels a bit pricey for what we ordered, but honestly, it was worth it.\n\nThe outdoor seating area is likely too hot to enjoy on a midsummer afternoon, though I bet it's absolutely charming in the evening. Definitely recommended if you're in the mood for a quick exotic hangout—or simply feeling a bit spendthrift."

They have a non refundable cover charge of 1000₹ which seemed unnecessary as the place didn't have so much to offer.\n\nThe tables are too small and the high chairs are quite uncomfortable. They really need to work on that.\nAlso we were disturbed by these two young ladies using their camera flash too often while shooting reels right next to us ruining our experience. The staff didn't seem to do anything in this regard so I had to ask them to stop."

For me, I often visit here for watching cinema & you can also have an evening chat with friends. The place become bustling with dancing, singing in the evening. Lots of options for fooding outside in the premise. The ticket price is very pocket friendly, good for the school or college students. There are 3 screens. Nandan 1 is the largest in capacity, I guess. I watched several cinema here. You can feel that the seating arrangement is not that good, not enough leg space, even you can't push your seat back like many others offer. But at this price point, this should be normal. Other 2 screens are comparatively smaller that the first one. The place is very easy to access. The area quite a big with a water body behind & is very clean."

It has this calm, artistic charm and is always buzzing with people - from film lovers to college students just hanging around. What makes it even more special is that the iconic filmmaker Satyajit Ray was actually involved in designing the logo and played a key role in shaping the idea of Nandan. You can really feel that cultural and creative energy here. Watched a film, walked around a bit, and clicked a few photos which I've shared here. If you're in Kolkata and love cinema or just want a peaceful spot to relax, definitely give Nandan a visit."

It's the very same street where you would find Peter Cat and Flurys Restaurants too. One can have elevator access to this place.\n\nIt's been a wonderful experience over here with all the finger licking dishes and every dish tasted awesome...Feels like having them over and over again. Moreover the atmosphere was quite soothing with a soft music in the background and water works with interior decoration.....\nI would like to suggest some dishes which we ordered:\nJingha Nizami\nRaan-e-Aaira\nMurgh Rozali Kebab\nMurgh Peshawai\nMurgh Patiyala\nMutton Afreen\nHyderabadi Murgh Biriyani\nKesariya Chenna Payash\nHot Chocolate Brownie with Ice Cream\nLilly Top\nGreen Apple NOJITO\nKiwi and Mango Smoothie\nLitchi and Strawberry Smoothie\n\nWe have been 4 and increased our appetite to reach for all the above-mentioned menu. Raan e Aaira and Jingha Nizami have been tremendously wonderful...and kiwi mango smoothie and Lilly top  too joined the same delight...All the foods were prepared and served with great care and attention with exotic spices simply enhancing the taste of each dish. As earlier mentioned this is a luxurious restaurant so it did go a bit heavy on pockets, costing around 1.1k per person.\n\nThis restaurant is Highly recommended and would surely like more and more persons to have a visit over here....and we too would like to visit again!!!! The tastes still runs in our tongue and nose......"

The staff are well mannered, though they goofed up on service of one item but they behaved well and admitted to the mistake.Food is top notch."

We liked the starters so much that we didn't order mains and directly ate dessert. The dessert was also really yummy. Though we were full before the dessert, no one could stop eating it.\nThe staff is very courteous and responsive. We got our orders very quickly. It is slightly difficult to find the place, though. I'd really love to go there again."

We thoroughly enjoyed every dish. Tamara specializes in continental dishes. So, we mostly had those dishes. I would recommend this place if you love continental food. And the best part, the staff members always help guests to choose the best dishes.\nLast but not least, the place had a beautiful ambience.\nOverall experience 9/10"

If you love a place under the open sky. You must visit this place. Well decorated place with wooden furnitures. You can arrange a birthday party here, even decorate your date. The pics are attached.\n\nFood:\n\nSince we are into continental delicacies, we had ordered some Italian and Spanish delicacies. They really served excellent food. We loved the taste and quality of the food. You must try their desserts. They are palatable.\n\nAgain I forgot what we ate.\n\nStaff:\n\nThey are always at your service. There is an incident that proved how dedicated staff they are. Every time I turned back to click photos, the staffs thought that we were looking for them. Every time they came to assist us. 🤣🤣\n\nP.S: must try Hazelnut mousse. Alaska. Pizza. Don't try parfait.\n\nIf you find my review helpful, kindly like it and follow me here and on Instagram (@awrijit). Peace n ❤."

We ordered a variety of dishes, starting with appetizers, moving on to a bit of the main course, and ending with some delicious desserts. Everything was served with great care and presentation.\n\nThe staffs were exceptionally pleasant, amiable, and attentive. They recommended their special dishes based on our preferences. Since some of my family members are seniors, the staff took time to engage with them, understand their tastes, and make suitable suggestions accordingly.\n\nThe ambiance of the lounge was unique—slightly dim, as is typical for such places—but upon our request, they brightened the space a bit so we could take some photos. Since we were with children, the staff made adjustments to ensure a comfortable and family-friendly atmosphere.\n\nWe also ordered a gin cocktail and a few mocktails, all of which were expertly crafted and incredibly flavorful. We ended up staying longer than expected as some of our relatives arrived late, but the staff remained kind, patient, and cooperative throughout.\n\nOverall, it was a wonderful experience—from the food and drinks to the ambiance and hospitality. Highly recommended!"

The food was just okay, nothing particularly impressive or memorable.\n\nHowever, the view from the restaurant was absolutely stunning! It's definitely a great spot to enjoy a meal with a beautiful backdrop.\n\nUnfortunately, the ambience didn't quite live up to my expectations. The music was too loud and didn't seem to match the atmosphere of the restaurant. It felt a bit disjointed and took away from my overall experience.\n\nOverall, I would recommend AltAir - Capella for its amazing view, but perhaps not for its food or ambience. Maybe they can work on improving those aspects to make it a more well-rounded experience."

The staff was friendly. The only thing that was disappointing was the jacuzzi on the rooftop. We booked this place because we saw the pool on the rooftop. And we thought we could use the jacuzzi if it was too cold to use the pool. The staff explained that the pool and jacuzzi were in operation. Unfortunately, the water in the pool was cold and we couldn't swim. So we went to the jacuzzi. The jacuzzi seemed to be filled with old cold water. The water wasn't heated and the jacuzzi didn't work. There were bugs and dust floating on the water. I was very disappointed in that. It's dishonest to advertise a jacuzzi that isn't maintained."

The food was good, the staff were very polite and professional, and the service was quick, which I really appreciated.\n\nHowever, I was disappointed that they weren’t serving in the open rooftop area. For some reason, it wasn't accessible, and that kind of defeated the whole purpose of choosing this place. I specifically picked Capella for the rooftop view, so it was a bit of a letdown. If you're going for the rooftop experience, you might want to check in advance whether it's available."

The ambiance of the lounge was fantastic, with a great rooftop view and a lively atmosphere. The service was prompt and courteous.\n\nThe Mix Chow was well-prepared, with a nice balance of flavors and a good mix of vegetables and protein. However, it could have been slightly spicier for my taste. The Fish in Hot Garlic Sauce was the highlight of the meal—perfectly cooked fish with a flavorful, garlicky kick that paired well with the sauce. The portion sizes were decent, making it a satisfying meal overall.\n\nOverall, Glook Sky Lounge offers a great dining experience, especially for those who enjoy a good mix of flavors and a vibrant setting. I’d definitely recommend it for a casual night out!\n\nRating: 4/5"

The white marble architecture looks stunning, especially during sunrise or sunset when the light hits the domes. The vast gardens around it are well-maintained and perfect for a peaceful walk or to sit and relax.\n\nInside, the museum offers a fascinating glimpse into colonial history, with impressive paintings, artifacts, and sculptures. The collection is quite large, so it’s worth taking your time to explore each gallery.\n\nDo plan to spend at least 2–3 hours here to fully enjoy both the museum and the surrounding gardens. There’s also a light and sound show in the evening that brings the history of the memorial to life.\n\nOverall, a must-visit place in Kolkata that combines history, architecture, and nature beautifully!"

I visited Mallik Ghat Flower Market yesterday.\n•\nMallik Ghat is one of the most popular places in Kolkata. It is located on the banks of the Hooghly River and below the Howrah Bridge.\n•\nThis is a very beautiful place. More than fifty thousand people come here every day. Because some come to buy flowers from the flower market, and some come to visit this wonderful beautiful place.\n•\nMallick Ghat Flower Market is the largest flower market in Kolkata and is one of the most popular places to visit.\n•\nMallick Ghat Flower Market is a favorite place for photographers.\n•\nIt would not be wrong to say that the place is the biggest flower market in Kolkata.I solely visited this place for the experience and it was undoubtedly a great one. I had walked all the way under the scorching sun and was tired by the time I reached, but the moment I entered the place it filled me up with energy from the crowd. The place was bustling with people and flowers being sold everywhere. The aroma from the variety of flowers here and there filled up the air with a unheard fragrance. It felt so fresh and the constant bargaining going around everywhere bought a smile to my face.\n\nThe place is pretty nice, the only drawback is that the place is a bit dirty and when it rains, the surroundings become a muddy mess.A little maintenance is needed here, then everything will be fine."

Dating back to 1855, it is a vibrant hub where hundreds of vendors gather daily to sell fresh flowers like marigolds, roses, tuberoses, lilies, and lotuses.\n\nThe market comes alive as early as 4:00 AM, with peak activity till 8:00 AM. Traders, wholesalers, and buyers from across the city and even from neighbouring states come here to buy flowers for temples, weddings, rituals, and festivals. The air is filled with fragrance, and the pathways are lined with heaps of colourful blooms, creating a visual and sensory treat.\n\nThough crowded and often muddy, the market reflects Kolkata’s cultural and spiritual rhythm. You’ll see garland-making in action, deals being negotiated, and porters carrying massive flower bundles on their heads. It’s also a favourite spot for photographers, especially during sunrise with the bridge in the backdrop.\n\n✅ Tips for Visitors:\nBest time to visit: Between 5 AM – 7 AM\n\nFootwear: Wear closed shoes; the ground is often wet.\n\nEntry: Free, no formal gate or ticket.\n\nGetting there: A short walk from Howrah railway station or Strand Road.\n\n🌟 Final Words:\nMullick Ghat Flower Market is not just a market—it’s an experience. It’s where commerce meets culture, and tradition thrives in every petal. A must-visit for those who want to feel the raw, authentic energy of Kolkata."

Standing proudly over the Hooghly River, this cantilever bridge connects the city of Howrah with the heart of Kolkata, carrying millions of people every single day.\n\nWhat makes the Howrah Bridge truly fascinating is its sheer scale and design. Built without a single nut or bolt, it is held together entirely by rivets, a testament to the brilliance of early 20th-century engineering. Walking or driving across it, you can feel the pulse of the city—the endless flow of buses, yellow taxis, rickshaws, and pedestrians all weaving into the daily rhythm of Kolkata life.\n\nBeyond its practical importance, the bridge has immense cultural and emotional value. For many Bengalis, the first glimpse of the Howrah Bridge while entering Kolkata symbolizes “homecoming.” At night, when the bridge lights up and reflects on the waters of the Hooghly, it transforms into a breathtaking sight—one that photographers and travelers cherish.\n\nThe Howrah Bridge is more than just steel and structure; it is a silent witness to Kolkata’s history, from the days of British India to modern times. It has seen generations grow, countless stories unfold, and remains one of the busiest bridges in the world.\n\nIf you are visiting Kolkata, experiencing the Howrah Bridge—whether by walking across it, viewing it from the ghats, or taking a ferry ride underneath—is an absolute must. It is not only an engineering wonder but also the very soul of the city."

The view of the Hooghly River from the bridge is beautiful during sunrise or sunset.\n3. At night, the lights on the bridge give it a nice glow.\n4. It connects the busy Howrah Railway Station with Kolkata city, so it's historically important.\n5. For people interested in raw city life, walking across it feels like stepping into Kolkata’s real daily rhythm.\n\n🔴What I didn’t like (and others should know)🔴\n\n6. The surrounding area is one of the dirtiest I’ve seen — garbage, spit, urine — it’s everywhere.\n7. It’s overcrowded with honking traffic, vendors, and people rushing in every direction.\n8. No one follows traffic rules, and there’s zero lane discipline.\n9. Ola and taxi drivers around the area are known for overcharging, refusing to turn on the AC, and behaving rudely.\n10. If you still want to go, visit early morning or late evening — it's slightly better and less crowded then."

It’s got everything—gorgeous lakes, vibrant gardens, and even mini Seven Wonders to snap pics with (just INR 30 to see ‘em)! 🚤 Boating’s a blast (INR 50–300), and I love renting a cycle (INR 70–150) to zip around. The musical fountain at night? Total magic! 🌟\n\nIt’s super family-friendly, though I wish there were more kid facilities. Everyone from toddlers to grandparents can enjoy it, but it’s not the best for wheelchairs. The park’s pretty eco-conscious with solar lights and recycling, but those plastic food stall cups bug me. ♻️ Entry’s only INR 30 (kids INR 15), and most activities are dirt cheap. Go early to dodge the weekend crowds! Pack water, sunscreen, and maybe a picnic—Eco Park’s perfect for making memories! 😄"

              "reviewText": "South Park Street Cemetery (a.k.a. Park Street Cemetery) — where Kolkata’s colonial past rests in peace (literally) and history peeks through layers of moss and mist. Established in 1767, this is one of the oldest non-church cemeteries in the world, a silent witness to the city’s British-era grandeur. Forget horror movies — this place is less \"The Conjuring\" and more \"Downton Abbey meets The Jungle Book\", with gothic tombs draped in banyan roots and squirrels darting between centuries-old epitaphs.\nAmong the notable “residents” here are Sir William Jones, the founder of the Asiatic Society, and Rose Aylmer, the muse of poet Walter Savage Landor (whose love for her was so deep, he wrote a poem that outlived empires). Many tombstones tell tales of lives cut short by tropical diseases, duels, and sometimes, just bad luck in 18th-century Kolkata.\nThe architecture is stunning — grand obelisks, pyramid-like tombs, and intricate carvings that scream Raj-era drama. And if you think cemeteries are spooky, try visiting on a foggy winter morning when the light filters through the trees — it’s eerily beautiful.\nVerdict: A hauntingly poetic escape in the heart of Kolkata.\nPro tip — Carry a camera, read the inscriptions, and remember, in a city that never sleeps, even the departed have fascinating stories to tell. 🪦🌿📜"

Such a beautiful place in the middle of a busy city like Kolkata is mind blowing. The designs and architecture of the buildings are amazing.\nEach and every information about Tagore's life has been potraied inside the house. The furniture clothes and other things used by Tagore and his family are also displayed inside.\nOverall it was a really nice experience of visiting this place. It is a highly recommended place to visit in Kolkata.\nPlease do visit this place."

So every 2 wheelers or four wheelers have to be parked in an open road which is too narrow and congested. There are small sweet shops at its gate premises! Don't expect for hygenic breakfast or lunch there! No outside packages allowed in the premises! Good place for nature lovers or if anybody wants to spend some time beside ganges...though it's guarded. So many old buildings and offices are still there which will give  horrific views. The main Banyan tree is not there..it's braches are there now..and they are too far from the main gate. Have to ask someone inside about the way to the branches of that tree..that particular area is restricted. Also Must say there is lack of maintanence at some places."

              "reviewText": "A Peaceful Evening at Prinsep Ghat, Kolkata\n\nThere’s something quietly magical about Prinsep Ghat—and this photo really says it all. Nestled along the banks of the Hooghly River, this place becomes pure poetry after sunset. The iconic Vidyasagar Setu stands tall in the background, its lights casting shimmering reflections on the water. You’ll often find little boats bobbing gently nearby, their canopies glowing softly under the moonlight.\n\nWhat makes Prinsep Ghat special isn’t just the view—it’s the feeling. The cool breeze, the sound of water lapping against the shore, and the distant hum of the city create this peaceful pocket where time seems to slow down. Whether you’re out for a quiet walk, deep in thought, or simply sitting by the water with a cup of chai, it’s the kind of place that lets you breathe a little deeper.\n\nThere’s no rush here. People come with friends, with loved ones, or alone—and somehow, everyone finds a little calm. You’ll see couples talking quietly on benches, photographers capturing long-exposure shots of the bridge, and boatmen offering rides across the glowing river.\n\nIf you ever find yourself in Kolkata, take an evening to visit. Trust me, it’s more than just a pretty view—it’s a moment you’ll carry with you.\n\nMy Take: Peaceful, scenic, and perfect for slowing down.\nWhen to Go: At sunset. The city lights reflecting on the water? Unreal.\nDon’t Miss: A boat ride under the bridge and grabbing some street snacks near the riverside."

It houses an incredible collection of artifacts from ancient times, including sculptures, fossils, coins, textiles, and more. The Egyptian mummy and the grand Buddhist galleries are particularly fascinating.\n\nThe museum is quite large, so give yourself at least 2–3 hours to explore it properly. It can get a little warm inside during summer months, so I recommend visiting in winter for a more comfortable experience. Overall, it's an enriching and educational experience that offers a glimpse into India’s vast and diverse heritage."

The collection is vast and incredibly diverse, showcasing historic items and antiques from across time and geography. The star attraction is the 4000 year old Egyptian mummy in the Egypt Gallery, which is truly fascinating. Apart from that, the museum also houses remarkable Buddhist archaeological treasures from Gandhara (present-day Kandahar, Afghanistan), along with fascinating galleries on fossils, zoology, birds, geology and what not. The Botany Survey of India is also part of this museum, adding to its richness and diversity. I would recommend keeping at least 2–3 hours aside to explore properly. This museum is a journey through both history and culture, and an absolute must visit."

Walking through its grand halls felt like stepping into a time machine-rich with history, knowledge, and artistic beauty. I was deeply impressed by the vast collection and the way everything was preserved and presented.\n\nAs someone with a love for history and culture, this visit was both inspiring and educational. I captured some memorable photos during my tour, but the real magic is something you have to experience in person.\n\nIf you’re ever in Kolkata, a visit to the Indian Museum is an absolute must. Whether you’re a curious traveler or a history enthusiast, you’ll leave with a deeper appreciation of South Asia’s rich heritage."

Walking through the ground floor of the museum it might appear that the people of the past weren't less intellect than us and even their appetite exceeds ours in some cases. The magnificent stone work would left the viewer speechless. No need to buy tickets in advance and  interestingly buying a photography ticket one can get permission of taking photos almost all the things though rate is different for mobile camera and digital cameras."

              "reviewText": "⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\nNicco Park is without a doubt one of the best attractions in Kolkata for a fun-filled day with family and friends. From the moment you step inside, you’re greeted with a lively atmosphere, lush greenery, and well-organized pathways that make the entire park easy to explore. It truly lives up to its nickname — the \"Disneyland of the East.\"\n\nThe variety of rides here is impressive. Whether you’re an adventure seeker who loves high-speed roller coasters and the Cyclone ride, or someone who prefers calmer experiences like the cable car or toy train, there’s something for everyone. The park maintains high safety standards, and you can see staff actively ensuring that rides are operated smoothly and securely.\n\nThe Water Park section is a highlight in itself — perfect for cooling off on a warm day. The wave pool, water slides, and lazy river are all well-maintained and super fun. Kids absolutely love the splash zones, and adults can enjoy the slides just as much.\n\nAnother great thing about Nicco Park is the cleanliness. You’ll find dustbins at regular intervals, and the staff are quick to keep the area neat. There are also plenty of food stalls offering everything from snacks to full meals, with both local and international options. The prices are reasonable for the quality and convenience.\n\nIt’s not just about rides — Nicco Park also has beautiful gardens, a small aquarium, and various fun activities that make it more than just an amusement park. You can easily spend an entire day here without feeling bored.\n\nOverall, Nicco Park offers excellent value for money and delivers an experience that’s enjoyable for people of all ages. It’s a must-visit in Kolkata if you’re looking for adventure, entertainment, and a bit of nostalgia all in one place."

The main amusement park has some exciting rides and scenic spots, and the water park is definitely a highlight, especially during the summer.\n\nHowever, it can get very crowded on weekends, especially in the water park section. Be prepared for long queues for most of the popular rides. If you're planning a visit, weekdays might be a better option for a more relaxed experience.\n\nThe food at the café inside was surprisingly good—fresh and tasty with decent options for both snacks and meals. One thing to note is that basic items like bottled water are sold at a premium—a 1-liter bottle costs ₹50, which feels a bit overpriced.\n\nOverall, Nicco Park offers a memorable day out, especially for families, but planning ahead and visiting on a less busy day can make a big difference."

              "reviewText": "Nicco Park is by far the best amusement park in Kolkata. I’ve visited countless places in the city, but none have given me such consistent joy throughout the entire day. The park is very well maintained as it is clean, organized, and run with great attention to detail. The staff are always friendly, helpful, and attentive to safety, which makes the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nWith nearly 40–45 attractions to explore, there’s something for everyone. I recommend booking tickets online in advance and opting for the combo with the waterpark entry; it usually costs around ₹1200 year-round, and you can sometimes find special offers at about ₹600. Do keep in mind that food, certain rides, games, lockers, and bowling are charged separately.\n\nFor the best experience, plan to arrive early (around 11 AM) so you have enough time to enjoy all the rides. If you’re visiting the Wet-o-Wild waterpark, make sure to bring synthetic clothing as required. The only downside is the food—the options at the food courts are consistently disappointing, so don’t expect much in that department.\n\nThat said, whether you’re with friends, family, or a partner, Nicco Park guarantees a day full of thrill, adventure, and plenty of laughter. It’s the perfect place for anyone looking to create fun and memorable experiences."

That energy was born here. Sachin’s records, Dhoni’s helicopter shots, and Kolkata Knight Riders’ IPL triumphs? All celebrated under Eden’s floodlights.\nBut Eden Gardens isn’t just about cricket. The Maidan surrounding it is Kolkata’s green lung, where footballers, morning walkers, and political rallies coexist in perfect chaos. Nearby, the Rabindra Sadan-Nandan cultural complex fuels Bengal’s love for theatre and films, while the Mohan Bagan, Mohammedan Sporting and East Bengal football clubs remind you that Kolkata’s second religion is football.\nAnd then there’s the Eden Gardens Park, a serene escape with a picturesque lake, along with the pagoda, perfect for a quiet evening stroll (assuming you aren’t still hoarse from screaming at a match).\nVerdict: Whether you love cricket or just the thrill of history, Eden Gardens is a must-visit.\nPro tip — Catch a live match here; the energy is electric, and the crowd could out-cheer a rock concert!"

              "reviewText": "Eden Gardens – The Mecca of Indian Cricket!\nLocated in the Maidan area near BBD Bagh, right opposite the Calcutta High Court, this is a legendary venue that resonates deeply with the soul of cricket.\n\nI have visited the stadium five times, and among those, the first-ever pink-ball Day-Night Test match between India and Bangladesh left a lasting impact on me. The stadium, with an approximate seating capacity of 68,000, was packed to the brim that day. During the event, I had a brief conversation with a ground staff member who shared info that the boundary dimensions are approximately 66–68 meters on the square side and 76–78 meters on the straight side.\n\nThe stands inside the stadium are named after cricketing legends such as Sourav Ganguly, Pankaj Roy, and Jagmohan Dalmiya. The B.C. Roy Club House named in honor of former West Bengal Chief Minister Dr. B.C. Roy.\n\nWhile attending matches, you might experience cellular connectivity issues due to the presence of signal jammers. However, vendors selling water and snacks are quite efficient. There are also food corners and canteens inside the stadium offering decent food, albeit at higher-than-usual prices.\n\nOne area that consistently falls short is crowd management. In my experience, the gathering process lacks professionalism. A stadium of such iconic status should ideally have more streamlined crowd-control mechanisms.\n\nFor your information I want to let you know that Eden Gardens is owned by the Eastern Command of the Indian Army and managed by the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB), whose headquarters are within the stadium complex.\n\nTo me, it isn’t just a cricket stadium, it’s a living monument to the sport in India. With a history spanning over 160 years, electrifying crowds, iconic matches, and a rich architectural legacy, it remains the heartbeat of cricketing culture and heritage in Kolkata and across the globe."

The temple's white marble architecture is both majestic and elegant, standing tall as a symbol of peace and devotion in the heart of the city.\n\nThe moment I stepped inside the premises, I was struck by the calm and clean environment. The intricate carvings on the walls and ceilings reflect exquisite craftsmanship and devotion. The temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and his consort Lakshmi, and the sanctum radiates a divine aura that makes one pause and reflect.\n\nThe beautifully maintained gardens, well-laid pathways, and the peaceful ambience made my visit very pleasant. Though photography isn’t allowed inside, the mental images of the serene interiors and the melodious temple bells will stay with me for a long time.\n\nThe temple is usually less crowded in the mornings and early evenings, which is when I would recommend going if you want a peaceful darshan. The security arrangements and cleanliness are commendable. It’s also conveniently located and easy to reach by public or private transport.\n\nIn short, Birla Mandir is not just a place of worship but a quiet retreat from the city’s hustle — perfect for spiritual seekers, architecture lovers, or anyone in need of a moment of calm."

The flavors were rich and the crispiness of the kabiraji was just perfect. The service was warm and efficient adding to the overall great experience.\n\nHad a wonderful time soaking in the history, the energy and the flavors.

I have been here twice mainly to soak in the nostalgia and though I tried different dishes, the taste was just average. Once known for good coffee and food, the quality has sadly deteriorated over the years, and the staff’s behavior is not very welcoming either.\n\nStill, it holds a unique charm. You will often find elderly groups sitting here, continuing their adda sessions that began during their college days, sometimes 50–60 years ago. For that sense of history and continuity, it’s worth a visit at least once but go for the nostalgia, not the food or the coffee."

The vintage interiors, high ceilings, and simple wooden furniture are unchanged. Outside, the slow-moving trams, iconic yellow taxis, and the bustling book stalls of College Street only add to the nostalgic experience.\n\nDespite being packed most of the time, the service is quick, and the coffee is strong and satisfying — just as it should be. It's easy to sit here for hours, soaking in the ambience and imagining the powerful debates and historic conversations that once filled the air.\n\nHighly recommended — not just for the coffee, but for a beautiful peek into Kolkata’s intellectual and cultural legacy."

The very soul of a café—its coffee—is its greatest flaw.\nThe prices are moderate, yes, but the quality of both food and service leaves much to be desired.\nCome here to soak in the charm of the past, to wander through its echoes and old-world aura.\nBut when it comes to the food—temper your expectations. The ambience may whisper poetry,\nbut the kitchen speaks in flat, dissonant prose."

Despite being surrounded by Kolkata’s bustling heart, the lush green courtyard—with its tall trees, soft grass, and occasional playful squirrels—feels like an oasis of serenity .Designed by Lt. James Agg of the Bengal Engineers and modeled after London’s St Martin-in-the-Fields, this neoclassical gem was built between 1784 and 1787 . Its stone structure—built from rare stones shipped from the medieval ruins of Gour—is why it's affectionately known as “Pathure Girja” (“Stone Church”) .\n\nIts most striking feature is the 174-ft tall stone spire crowned by a massive clock, which serves as both a landmark and a timeless centerpiece . The grand portico, lined with Doric or Corinthian columns, ushers visitors into a space that exudes architectural dignity and grace ."

The ride was smooth and enjoyable, and the ticket price was incredibly affordable—just Rs. 6 for a one-way trip, making it a great value for money.\n\nThe park itself is a nice place to relax by the river, but the atmosphere was quite humid, which made it a bit uncomfortable to stay for long, especially during the day. Despite that, it's a good spot for a quick outing, and the boat ride alone makes it worth visiting."

It was a rainy afternoon. The park was empty offering a lush green view. Most of the rides which were once an eye-catcher were dilapidated and counting on their last days. The shabby ticket counter called upon us to remind of its golden busy days. Broken things although looks sad has their own way of showing beauty, that it is okay to let go and hold onto the memories buried in the crevices. The trees were happy though, the leaves getting to dance upon the drizzle. We had a good time with everything."

As the sun begins to dip, the park blushes in gold. Trees glow, the Hooghly shimmers, and the city gently slows its pace. In these golden hours, the park unveils its quiet magic.\n\nThe air turns softer, laughter warmer, and even silence feels romantic. Couples find cozy corners, steps grow slower, and hearts sync with the sunset. With the majestic river flowing beside and Howrah Bridge bathed in amber light, it’s a moment that belongs in poetry.\n\nPerfectly couple-friendly, the park offers breezy walkways, inviting benches, and peaceful views made for long conversations. That view of the setting sun behind the bridge? Pure magic.\n\nWhether you’re walking hand in hand, watching the sky change, or just soaking it all in—Millennium Park at golden hour is Kolkata’s softest love story.A must-visit for romantic souls and golden-hour chasers."

Housed inside a restored 1938 tram, this charming little museum at Esplanade is where Kolkata’s iconic trams hit the brakes — literally and historically!\nWhat’s on Track?\n1. A Tram Ride to the Past – Smaranika (meaning ‘souvenir’) takes you on a ticketed journey through time, showcasing Kolkata’s tram history, dating back to 1873, when horse-drawn trams ruled the city! It’s a bit like time travel, but with wooden seats.\n\n2. Tickets, Tokens & Timeless Tales – From vintage punched tickets to old conductor uniforms and route maps, the museum brings alive the golden era when tram conductors actually issued paper tickets instead of just swiping smart cards.\n\n3. Tram Café? Yes, Please! – One half of the tram serves as a mini café, where you can sip on tea and munch on snacks while pretending you’re in the early 1900s. Best part? The food is priced as affordably as tram tickets!\n\nFinal Stop: For ₹20, this museum is cheaper than your daily commute and far more enjoyable! Whether you’re a history buff or just want a unique Instagram story, Smaranika is a must-visit for a true-blue Kolkatan experience!"

It consists of a restored tram parked in its own enclosure. The front car has a few tiny tables where one can sip tea or coffee (and perhaps munch on biscuits or chips – there is a very limited menu). The rear car – which can be entered only through the front car – has a display of old photographs, a few old uniforms, old tickets and tokens, etc. The exhibits seem rather neglected and do not seem to attract many visitors except for diehard fans.\n\nNearest Metro: Esplanade Gate no\n\nTiming: 1pm to 8pm (Thursday closed)\n\nFollow me on Instagram for more\nIG: @_haque_fiza_\n\nThe ticket costs Rs. 20/- and permits you to stay there for 45 minutes – perhaps they want to discourage visitors from lounging there for too long! Incidentally, the ticket itself is designed to look like a tram ticket (see photo) and it serves as a souvenir of your visit. Also it's closed every Thursday.\n\nUnfortunately they do not permit photography inside the museum space. But now it is permissible. However, I clicked a couple of photos outside the fencing, which I am posting here.\n\nThank You 😊"

One part of the tram houses a cozy café, while the other serves as the museum space. Open daily (except Thursdays), it’s a charming blend of history and nostalgia, celebrating Kolkata’s enduring relationship with trams and preserving a key part of the city’s cultural identity."

The only 2 bad things are photography is prohibited and the park stays open only from 1 to 4 PM in the afternoon which is a odd time. Specially on summer days. Anyways despite the no photography allowed people were still taking pics and all so I took some shots as well,  it'd okish to be there if you are in the area its a normal park and since it closes off at 4 you cant spend the evening there."

Whether you’re escaping office stress, walking off a heavy lunch from Park Street, or just craving silence in the city—this place delivers.\n\nWhy Elliot Park stands out 🌿\n\n1. Immaculately maintained: The walking tracks are clean, the lawns are manicured, and the benches are never too crowded. A welcome surprise, especially in central Kolkata!\n\n2. Perfect for walkers and joggers: The circular path is wide, shaded, and ideal for early morning jogs or evening strolls. You’ll find fitness enthusiasts, seniors, and college students all vibing in harmony.\n\n3. Green escape with skyline views: While you enjoy the chirping birds and tall trees, the distant silhouette of downtown Kolkata peeks through—best of both worlds.\n\n4. Safe and peaceful: Entry is free but secure. It feels family-friendly, with couples, kids, and elderly visitors all coexisting without any nuisance.\n\nExtras that make it special:\n\nPhotography alert: Visit around 4:30–5:30 PM for golden light filtering through the trees—ideal for portraits or casual reels.\n\nProximity bonus: Maidan Metro, Victoria Memorial, and St. Paul’s Cathedral are all within walking distance. Makes for a beautiful half-day circuit.\n\nNo hawkers inside = clean experience. But don’t worry—there’s always a bhel puri or tea stall right outside the gates when hunger hits.\n\nHeads-up ⚠️\n\nClosed on Mondays for maintenance.\n\nNo food or loud music allowed—this is a calm space, not a picnic ground.\n\nLimited shaded seating—carry a cap if you're visiting in the afternoon.\n\nLocal tip: Carry a book or some headphones and let the world slow down. If you’re a working professional, this is your go-to spot for a reset. If you’re a tourist, it’s the quiet pause you didn’t know you needed between Victoria and Park Street.\n\nElliot Park is proof that in the middle of chaos, Kolkata still has places that let you just... be.\n\nIf this review helped you find your new favorite spot, tap that 👍 Helpful button and show some love for the city's green lungs!"

              "reviewText": "Ah, the iconic Babughat! The name itself is a delightful throwback to Kolkata’s aristocratic past — imagine a zamindar with a monocle sipping cha while discussing Shakespeare and share prices. Built in 1830 by Rani Rashmoni, the original boss lady of Bengal, Babughat isn’t just another riverside stop — it’s the ultimate throwback Thursday in stone and soul.\n\nWith its Greek-Doric columns and faded colonial charm, Babughat is like an old photograph that refuses to yellow with time. It was once a posh bathing ghat for the “babus” of yesteryear — hence the name — and over the years, it has morphed into an eclectic hotspot for everyone from temple-goers to ticket-checkers.\n\nWhat’s the Buzz at Babughat?\n- It’s a multi-tasking marvel — part ghat, part transit hub, part protest ground, and fully Kolkata. One minute you’re watching a political rally; the next, it’s a flower-seller’s market.\n- The Colonial portico structure is one of the last remaining neoclassical gems still clinging to dignity despite buses honking their way around it.\n- It’s one of the most active immersion ghats during Durga Puja, where goddesses and goodbyes meet in a crescendo of conch shells and camera flashes.\n\nThe Real Experience:\nThe ghat is less about peace and more about poetry in motion. You’ll find priests chanting, pigeons cooing, lovers whispering, and sadhus contemplating life — or possibly lunch. It’s chaotic, colorful, and charmingly cluttered — a microcosm of Kolkata’s soul with a splash of river nostalgia.\n\nAnd let’s not forget the iconic launches that ferry passengers across the Hooghly from here. If you haven't taken a boat ride from Babughat to Howrah at sunset, you're seriously missing out on one of Kolkata’s cheapest and most cinematic experiences.\n\nKolkata Recommends:\nGet there early to beat the bustle, click a few sepia-toned shots, grab a \"jhalmuri\" from a moustachioed vendor, and let the Hooghly whisper tales of colonial Calcutta and modern madness.\n\nVerdict:\nBabughat isn’t just a place — it’s a state of nostalgia.

It is the second oldest ghat in Kolkata and is known for its colonial-era architecture, including a tall structure with Greek-style pillars. The ghat served as a busy spot for ferry services and is also a popular location for religious rituals.\nI want to invite you all ,please visit here and experience extraordinary things ....2nd time  i came here so I was feeling glad to visit it.....For more interesting and informative reviews about West Bengal even kolkata then you should follow me here or on Facebook .....

Built in 1830 by Rani Rashmoni, its grand pillars and view of the Hooghly River make it a scenic spot, especially at sunset.

Example: they spoke about energy sustainability and the need to conserve it in our personal lives at the end of the coal mine show. Focusing on how difficult, risky and capital intensive mining is. With an explanation of why coal mining is unsustainable and the fact they still feed a majority of our thermal power plants for electricity generation.\nThe only issue is that a good number of equipment and display screens don't work. The upkeep is poor as in most state maintained facilities and that affects the overall learning journey.\nThat said, there's still plenty to explore and learn.\nWe thoroughly enjoyed the visit and highly recommend it especially for children and even the younger population."

Maintain the beauty of the place! And to the tourist who wants to visit the sanctuary Do not litter here &  there don't throw your water bottle in sanctuary there are dustbins available use that🙂"

The trail is narrow and the forest is dense I recommend sticking to the trail or else you might get lost.\n\nBest time to visit this is in winter November and December.

It is one of the biggest mosques in India and the biggest mosque in the eastern part of India as well as West Bengal. It was opened in 1926, and 10,000 can offer prayers here. It allows both men and women to pray and also allows people from different faiths. The only thing that should be kept in mind is the proper dressing while visiting here.\n\nI got inner peace in this mosque, and the people here are very helpful. I visited here in the afternoon when people started gathering here, and they started doing Namaz.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience. If you live in Kolkata, you should visit here, especially during Ramadan."

Built between 1840 and 1844, it is named after Sir Charles Theophilus Metcalfe, who served as the Governor-General of India in the 1830s. He was known for his liberal policies and for supporting freedom of the press, which earned him great respect.\n\nThe hall was designed in the Greek Revival style, with 30 massive Corinthian columns, giving it a neoclassical look that resembles ancient Greek temples. Initially, it housed the Calcutta Public Library and later the Imperial Library, which eventually became the National Library of India. Today, it serves as a heritage center showcasing Kolkata’s cultural and historical evolution.\n\nMetcalfe Hall is a peaceful and beautifully preserved colonial-era building, perfect for history buffs and architecture lovers. The exhibitions inside are curated to reflect Kolkata’s past, with displays on literature, freedom movement, and cultural transitions. It’s not a typical tourist hotspot, so it’s less crowded—making it ideal for a quiet, reflective visit. Entry is usually free, and photography is allowed inside. It’s especially recommended if you enjoy heritage walks or want a break from the city’s usual hustle."

The crowd those who are visiting are less interested in the information and more to take that ultimate photo!\nThe first floor is where all the fun is. Quite photogenic and full of short but important information. The ground floor it seems was done in a haste and not planned or curated properly. For which the Metcalfe Hall gets a 4 star"

Once the hall hosted the Calcutta Public Library, featuring near about 5000 books transferred from Fort William & various donations. Dwarkanath Tagore served as its first proprietor. The hall became the Imperial Library in 1903 under Lord Curzon, eventually the nucleus of the National Library, which moved to Belvedere House in 1925. Later taken over by the ASI in the year 1992, extensive restoration was completed in 2018–19 & reopened as an exhibition & cultural space.\n\nThis stunning neoclassical Greek-revival was inspired by Athens, modeled after the Ancient Greek Tower (Temple) of the Winds, was free of cost earlier when I visited a few years back. The rectangular two-storey hall with five chambers, a majestic western stairway (now closed), and the main entrance on Hare Street is now charged Rs. 20/- per person. At the very first moment you reach, you have to scan the code & pay the said amount. A single person (single payment system) can purchase or pay for five persons at once. Your identity proof (namely Aadhar card or number) is a must for entrance. If people visit in a group, then the identity proof of any one member can be considered valid.\n\nIt will take approx 2 hours to completely tour the entire museum. The place is indeed photogenic. You can often find some photographers & vloggers with their models. These things are more or less destroying the peaceful & vintage vibes of the place I guess. Need more maintenance as the visitors knowingly or unknowingly damaged its properties which is not a good sign.\n\nIf you're exploring the historic BBD Bag area or visiting the Hooghly riverfront, this is a must see, especially for those who appreciate heritage, art & Bengali ethos."

The experience out here is breathtaking as the view of the city from the top floor of the structure is amazing.\nThe place offers an array of restaurants to make one's experience a little more exciting. The price of food here is a little too expensive but it's worth it because one gets to enjoy both the great view of the city at a good height and enjoy great food both at the same time. It gets a little saturated with space at times as the structure can allow a certain number of people inside it for the safety purposes. Keeping aside this factor, one can come and visit here with both friends and family for a lovely experience. However, getting a public transport to places from here can be a matter of concern at times but one can always opt for busses for some areas but for longer distances, it's always good to travel by cabs. In short,  if you want to enjoy breathtaking views of the city either during the day or the evening or night, do visit this place for that and enjoy mouthwatering delights to make your experience a little more comfortable and exciting.\nDon't forget to note the difficulties of accommodation and the high prices of the food along with the problems of traveling to the place and back. Otherwise, this place is just right for groups of all ages, kids as well as family to experience a wonderful time in the city."

The location and atmosphere are really pleasant, and you can enjoy a nice scene while sitting and eating.\n\nHowever, when it comes to the food, I found it a bit disappointing. The taste was just average, and in my opinion, some of the dishes were slightly bland — they didn’t have much flavor or spice. I was expecting more, especially considering the prices.\n\nAt the price they charge, I believe the food should taste better. It’s not that the food was bad, but it didn’t match the level of taste I expected for that cost. So overall, great view and environment, but the food could definitely be improved."

It features a circular glass viewing gallery suspended above the road, offering panoramic views of the area. The design is modern and eye-catching, especially when lit up at night.\n\nVisitors can enjoy a quiet walk inside the air-conditioned glass gallery, which displays exhibits related to Bengal’s culture. The gate also houses India’s first hanging restaurant, where guests can dine above the city with a scenic view. Entry to the gallery requires an advance online booking.\n\n✅ Final Thoughts:\nBiswa Bangla Gate is a unique attraction that combines art, architecture, and cityscape views. It’s a great place for photography, a casual visit, or a special dining experience. Clean, safe, and well-maintained—definitely worth a visit if you're in New Town."

              "reviewText": "Amidst the architectural splendor of Kolkata’s historic district stands the iconic Town Hall, an imposing neoclassical structure that has witnessed the city’s transformation from the capital of British India to the cultural epicenter of modern Bengal. Built in 1813-14 during the British Raj, Town Hall was once the beating heart of intellectual discourse, elite gatherings, and civic events. Today, it remains a significant landmark, echoing tales of Kolkata’s rich past while embracing its evolving future.\n\nAn Architectural Masterpiece\nDesigned by Colonel John Henry Garstin, the Town Hall is an impressive Greco-Roman structure, featuring tall Doric columns, grand staircases, and a vast central hall. The building's majestic façade, made of chunar sandstone and brick, exudes an aura of colonial elegance, making it one of the finest examples of 19th-century British architecture in India.\n\nThe hall, spanning 12,000 square feet, was originally built to serve as a venue for European aristocrats, bureaucrats, and merchants to host balls, banquets, and official meetings. However, over time, its role evolved, and it became a hub for public discourse, political debates, and literary events.\n\nA Storied Past\n- Town Hall’s early days: It was exclusively meant for the British elite, with Indians largely restricted from entering.\n- Freedom Movement connections: By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Town Hall became a meeting ground for Indian intellectuals, reformists, and nationalist leaders, discussing ideas that shaped the independence movement.\n- Post-independence evolution: After India gained independence, the hall transitioned into a civic and cultural center, hosting exhibitions, conferences, and public events.\n\nFascinating Facts About Town Hall\n- In 1897, Swami Vivekananda delivered a powerful lecture here after his triumphant return from the West.\n- Kabiguru Rabindranath Tagore, along with other literary and political figures, frequently attended discussions at this venue.\n- The Town Hall Museum, added in the 21st century, showcases a digital archive of Kolkata’s history, featuring rare maps, documents, and photographs.\n\nA Historic Treasure in Need of Attention\nDespite its historical significance, Town Hall has faced periods of neglect, with structural wear threatening its grandeur. However, in recent years, restoration efforts by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation have revived its lost charm, ensuring that this colonial jewel continues to stand tall.\n\nToday, Town Hall remains a symbol of Kolkata’s intellectual and political legacy, a place where history whispers through its walls, urging the present to remember its past."

But, got saddened to see the way KMC people are taking care of the whole property.\n\nThe main auditorium on the first floor is still better, if not well-maintained. But the lavatories are pathetic. I entered and literally bounced back. It is being rented out for private events these days. But if you experience the washrooms, it's no better than a \"Sulabh.\" Even some of the \"Sulabhs\" in Kolkata are better maintained than this.\n\nPls wake up the authorities and look into it."

The serene atmosphere and the presence of Mother Teresa's tomb create a sense of peace and reverence. The museum, which displays her personal belongings and relics, offers a glimpse into her humble life and dedication to serving the poorest of the poor.\n\nThe staff were courteous and respectful, ensuring that visitors could reflect and pray in a tranquil environment. The daily Mass at the chapel is a beautiful experience, and the museum's exhibits are both informative and inspiring.\n\nThis place is not just a tourist spot but a pilgrimage for those who admire Mother Teresa's work and legacy. It's a must-visit for anyone looking to find some inner peace and learn about the incredible humanitarian efforts of Mother Teresa and her sisters.\n\nThe entry is free and there are shops nearby selling souvenirs."

              "reviewText": "Review of Mother House, Missionaries of Charity – Kolkata\n\nAmong all the places I visited in Kolkata, Mother House left the most lasting impression on my heart. Nestled in a modest lane of the bustling city, this place radiates peace, simplicity, and divine presence. It is the headquarters of the Missionaries of Charity, founded by Saint Mother Teresa, and visiting here felt like stepping into a sacred space of love and humility.\n\nThe sisters welcomed everyone with warmth and grace. They gently guided us through the areas open to visitors – the tomb of Mother Teresa, the chapel where she used to pray, and the museum, which preserves many of her personal belongings. The museum is simple yet powerful – you’ll find her worn sandals, handwritten letters, rosaries, her iconic white and blue saree, the awards she received, and deeply moving quotes that reflect her selfless mission.\n\nOne of the most touching moments was seeing Mother Teresa’s own room – a tiny space with just a simple bed, a table, and no fan. It was a striking reminder of her vow to live among and like the poorest of the poor. Even today, the sisters live in the same humble manner – I saw them drawing water with buckets from a tank below, living a life of complete simplicity and service.\n\nPeople from across the world visit to seek peace, offer prayers, and draw strength from the legacy of Mother Teresa. Many, including myself, have experienced miraculous blessings after praying to her. There’s a quiet sense of healing and hope in the air – the kind that words can barely capture.\n\nWhile Kolkata has many attractions, Mother House is a place that touches the soul. It’s not just a tourist spot – it’s a spiritual home that holds unforgettable memories and a timeless message of love and compassion."

It's a place that just feels different. As soon as you step inside the gates, the noise of the city seems to just fade away.\n\nThe main thing to see is Mother Teresa's tomb, which is incredibly simple and beautiful. People are kneeling and praying, and the atmosphere is so peaceful and respectful. It's a very powerful place for quiet reflection. The small museum is interesting, too, with some of her personal belongings and a little history on the Missionaries of Charity.\n\nIt's not a place you'll spend hours and hours at, but you don't need to. It's a quick, quiet visit that leaves a lasting impression. It's a nice change of pace from the typical Kolkata sightseeing and a powerful reminder of her legacy. If you're looking for a moment of peace and a chance to feel connected to a truly remarkable person, it's absolutely worth a visit."

The quiet surroundings, elegant structures, and lush greenery make it an ideal place to pause, breathe, and reconnect with yourself.\n\nWhether you’re visiting to sit in silence, admire the architecture, or just enjoy a quiet moment by the Hooghly River, the place welcomes everyone with a gentle calmness. There’s a sacred feeling in the air—as if the presence of Sri Ramakrishna, Maa Sarada, and Swami Vivekananda still flows through the campus.\n\nThe main temple beside the Ganga is especially mesmerizing. Watching the river drift by while you sit in stillness is an experience that stays with you. Bhog is served in the morning (before 11 AM), but it’s good to come early to avoid the long queue. There are many quiet corners under the trees where you can simply sit and reflect.\n\nThe entire premises are spotless and beautifully arranged, making it perfect for a peaceful walk with family or time alone. It’s truly a place that helps you disconnect from life’s noise and feel inner peace. Just check the timings before you go—the temple is open from 6:30 to 11:30 AM and again from 3:30 to 8:30 PM.\n\nWords may fall short—but the experience speaks for itself."

              "reviewText": "🌟 A Soulful and Serene Experience at Belur Math, Kolkata 🌟\nVisiting Belur Math was a truly peaceful and enriching experience. Located on the banks of the Hooghly River, this spiritual headquarters of the Ramakrishna Mission is not just a place of worship but a symbol of harmony and inner peace.\n\nThe campus is extremely clean, well-maintained, and beautifully landscaped. The main temple's architecture is unique — it combines Hindu, Christian, and Islamic motifs, reflecting the teachings of Sri Ramakrishna about the unity of all religions. The atmosphere inside the temple is calm and meditative.\n\nOne of the highlights of the visit was the museum inside the Math premises, which gives deep insights into the lives and teachings of Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, and Sarada Devi. It's a must-visit for those interested in Indian philosophy and spiritual thought.\n\nThe evening Aarti (prayer ceremony) is mesmerizing and fills the entire space with divine vibrations. The gentle sound of bells, chants, and the serene river breeze create a powerful yet peaceful ambiance.\nThe staff and volunteers are courteous and helpful. Photography is not allowed inside the temple, which actually helps you disconnect from distractions and connect more deeply with the experience.\nOverall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)\nPerfect for: Spiritual seekers, history and culture lovers, and anyone looking for peace and inspiration.\nTip: Visit during evening Aarti and take a walk along the riverside garden — it’s magical."

The temple’s riverside view adds to the calmness, with a clean and serene environment all around.\n4. Photography isn’t allowed inside the main temple.\n5. Since it’s a Hindu spiritual place, some rules are followed, but nothing feels too restrictive.\n6. The entire vibe is soothing - even just sitting quietly feels refreshing.\n7. The architecture blends traditional and modern simplicity beautifully.\n8. Recommended for anyone seeking peace, especially during sunrise or sunset."

As I stepped into the serene grounds, a sense of peace washed over me, as if the chaos of the outside world had been left behind at the gate. The architecture immediately caught my attention. It’s unlike anything I’ve ever seen—a magnificent blend of Hindu, Christian, Islamic, and even Buddhist influences. It silently speaks the message of unity in diversity.\n\nWalking barefoot on the marble floors, I could feel the vibrations of devotion and history beneath my feet. The main temple, where Sri Ramakrishna is worshipped, has an aura that is difficult to describe in words. I just stood there, silently, feeling every breath slow down, as if time had paused for a while.\n\nI also visited the room where Swami Vivekananda spent his final days—it gave me goosebumps. The museum, filled with rare photos and items used by the great souls of the Ramakrishna Order, was deeply inspiring.\n\nSitting by the Ganges at sunset, watching the reflection of the temple in the water, I realized this wasn’t just a place—it was a living prayer. Belur Math isn’t just worth visiting—it’s worth feeling"

The staff is attentive and polite, and the service is excellent, with drinking water provided. The latte was delightful, made with freshly brewed coffee beans, featuring lovely latte art and accompanied by a complimentary cookie, which was a nice touch.\n\nThe other items we tried were tasty, not overly oily, and quite satisfying. The washroom was clean and well-maintained, and the availability of charging points with chargers makes it convenient for working. While the seating arrangements were limited, we didn't face any waiting time. However, the ergonomics could be improved, as most tables are too low for comfortable use.\n\nIt would be great if they added more variety to their menu, including croissants and gluten-free options. A few tweaks, and this place would be perfect!"

Situated near the AJC Bose Road in between Exide crossing and Minto Park, this cafe offers a good variety of snacks and beverage options. The first thing to mention about this cafe is its excellent artistic ambience. They have all the modern artefacts, paintings ans other exotic decorative staff to give a unique feel inside this cafe. They have a nice book shelf with a very good variety of books but being in Kolkata, Bengali books are definitely missed here. Apart from that, they have charging points and high tables which are quite suitable for work or online meetings. Talking about the menu, we ordered Chicken Vietnamese roll, spicy chicken katsu sandwich and mocha. Among these, the roll was quite unique to taste, it was cold but very delicious due to its unique saucy flavour. The mocha was also very well brewed and good to taste. The lead time of serving was also quite practical. The staff members were very polite, attentive and good listeners. They were quite modest while talking to us, suggesting or taking orders. The washroom was very neat and clean ans well maintained. There are limited seats inside the cafe, once you get in, you will get a nice charming look which is very pleasing and charming. Prices are of course little high and the variety of foods can be improved."

However, the interior is stylish and the staff service is good. The best part is the food. All the menus are delicious. Especially the sandwiches made with Panini bread were so delicious. The smoothie bowl was like the acai bowl I had in Hawaii. The pancakes and ice cream on top were also delicious. The tacos were topped with fried avocado. Very classy and delicious. I love this place so much. I've been here 3 times during my trip and have been satisfied every time."

Streets were almost empty, the platforms are wet, there has been a persistent rain since morning and people seen rather quiet in conducting their commute-related activity.\nExcellent artistic ambience of Artsy cafe and a perfectly complimenting weather is a too good to be true experience. Haha\nMy friend and I walked out into the rain, our usual Artsy is a walkable distance away from metro station.The cafe is located  somewhere at a turn in a busy bhawanipore street, this place however  is relatively free from the prosaic urban trappings.\nWe spent a couple of hours being part productive and part laughs and giggles there.\nWe had  blueberry cheesecake yummy as always and  dark chocolate espresso which was very well brewed.\nHave been here twice or thrice, everytime absolute delight. The foood's good, The staff here is praiseworthy of what they do, always polite and sharing smiles😊\nI had a great afternoon there.\nI'm always happy to bee here when my people suggests Artsy on day outs.\nWell, definitely planning to see Artsy again.✌️"

Nestled like a grand old Maharaja at the heart of B.B.D. Bagh, this imposing white-domed beauty has been delivering drama, bills, love letters, and legal summons with equal flair since 1868.\n\nA Post Office With Serious Posture\nDesigned by Walter B. Grenville (clearly a man who didn’t believe in subtle entrances), the GPO is a Neoclassical masterpiece, flaunting Corinthian pillars, giant clock towers, and a dome that could give the Capitol Building a complex. It’s more regal than most palaces and about as efficient as your grandma with birthday reminders.\n\nWalk through its grand colonnades and you're instantly transported to an era where pigeons were considered rivals and the postman was the OG influencer.\n\nBeneath the Glamour, A Bit of Ghost History\nHere's a juicy nugget: the GPO was built right over the ruins of the Old Fort William, razed after the Battle of Plassey. A small plaque near the eastern steps marks the “Black Hole of Calcutta” — yes, \"that\" infamous dungeon. Now, that’s some deep post-colonial subtext.\n\nFun ‘Post-al’ Facts:\n- It’s the largest post office in India by volume of mail handled.\n- The GPO houses a Philatelic Bureau that’s a haven for stamp collectors, aka the hipsters of the postal world.\n- Still operational and elegant, it’s where the past and present shake hands — in triplicate.\n\nWorth a Visit?\nAbsolutely. Whether you’re sending a postcard, buying a commemorative stamp, or just gawking at the colonial grandeur, the GPO delivers — literally and metaphorically.\n\nFinal Stamp of Approval?\nThe Kolkata GPO is not just about postage — it’s about poise, purpose, and nostalgia sealed in an envelope and dropped into the past. In a world of WhatsApps and DMs, it still stands proud, reminding us that sometimes, a letter in hand is worth two emails in spam."

Lot of old postal stamps, machines and letters to be seen here. It's beautiful and has been donated by people who like and have been collecting stamps/artifiacts for a long time.\n\nThere are real telegrams also displayed along with real Post boxes from Chennai used in places of high order like the Raj Bhavan or important areas.\n\nSweet and simple. Must visit once for people who love history.\nThe cafe here is nice. Well lit and wel kept. Food is so so but coffee at 50/- was good."

It has been an integral part of Kolkata’s cultural identity for decades.\n\n• 📍 Located near Nandan and not far from Rabindra Sadan or Exide More, it is easily reachable via the Rabindra Sadan Metro Station. While not directly beside Nandan, it's a short and easy walk from there, nestled in a lively and artistic corner of the city.\n\n• I visited the Academy of Fine Arts for the first time yesterday with my cousins, and we explored both a painting and photography exhibition. It was a memorable and inspiring experience, offering a calm and unhurried space to truly appreciate the works on display. 🎨📸\n\n• The exhibitions featured a diverse mix of styles and themes, from bold contemporary pieces to emotional, narrative-driven photography. The environment inside was peaceful, allowing us to connect with the art without distraction. The lighting and display arrangements were modest but effective.\n\n• It’s also worth noting that there was no entry fee, which makes it even more accessible for anyone interested in exploring art. Despite being a free-entry venue, the experience didn’t feel lacking in any way — it’s clear the focus here is on substance over flash.\n\n---\n\nOverall: The Academy of Fine Arts is a must-visit for art lovers in Kolkata. ✨ If you're looking to engage with meaningful painting and photography in a quiet, thoughtful setting — without spending a rupee — this is a wonderful place to start."

Take the Rabindra Sadan Metro (Blue Line), and once you're out, you’ll reach in under 3–4 minutes on foot. Can’t miss it—it's tucked beside cultural legends.\n\n🎨Experience:\nVisited for a painting and photography exhibition—and wow, it was surprisingly impressive. The layout was simple, nothing OTT, but the artworks had depth. You could just walk in (no entry fee), take your time, and let the silence of the halls do the talking.\n\nThe vibe is peaceful. No rush, no loud tour groups, just people slowly taking in the art. And hey, you don’t need to be an art snob to enjoy it. It’s raw, real, and very Kolkata."

              "reviewText": "The iconic Writer’s Building — Kolkata’s grand old office — has been watching history unfold since 1777, making it older than the United States of America’s constitution! Originally built by the British East India Company to house junior clerks (or “writers”), this red-bricked giant evolved from a mere workplace into the epicenter of Bengal’s political drama.\nArchitecturally, it’s a stunning blend of French Renaissance and Greco-Roman influences, complete with massive Corinthian columns, arched windows, and statues of Greek gods silently judging the bureaucrats inside. But don’t be fooled by its regal exterior — this place has seen enough action to put a Bollywood thriller to shame.\nMost famous is the Chittaranjan Das-led revolution of 1930, when three young freedom fighters — Benoy, Badal, and Dinesh — stormed the building, assassinated Colonel N.S. Simpson (a ruthless British officer), and fought till their last breath. The spot, now marked as \"B.B.D. Bagh,\" stands as a tribute to their bravery.\nToday, the Writer’s Building is the seat of the West Bengal state government, though its corridors echo with both political power and the occasional ghost story! Yes, some believe the spirits of former clerks still linger, probably waiting for overdue paperwork.\nVerdict: A historical gem wrapped in bureaucracy. Pro tip — visit during daylight - with the appropriate permissions - for the best view, unless you enjoy ghostly whispers of unfinished files! 🏛️📜👻"

Now only a few departments have their partial operations in Writer's building ( I saw some people came to visit the PWD department)..\nHope , our pride Writer's building will become operational like before very soon and make the Iconic Dalhousie area again super busy 🤞"

Colonel N. S. Simpson by three Bengali revolutionaries - Benoy Basu, Badal Gupta, and Dinesh Gupta. The square surrounding the building was later renamed B.B.D. Bagh in their honor.\nCurrent Status and Renovation:\nSince India's independence in 1947, it has served as the State Secretariat and the office of the Chief Minister of West Bengal.\nIt is currently undergoing a major restoration and renovation project, which was initiated in late 2013 with an estimated cost of US$29 million.\nDuring the renovation, the Chief Minister's office and other government departments temporarily shifted to a building called Nabanna in Howrah.\nThe restoration process has faced delays and challenges, but work on the project continues.\nWhile entry into the main building is restricted to employees, visitors can admire its impressive exterior."
