Spoiler alert: I did not.\n\nFirst off, let's talk about the views. They're so good, I almost forgave myself for topping my first tee shot 40 yards into a bush. The course is carved beautifully into the Hua Hin hills, and while it's stunning, it's also sneakily designed to test every ounce of your mental stability-and your short game.\n\nFairways? Immaculate. Greens? Fast enough to make you question every life decision that led to a four-putt. The undulations here are no joke. I read one green like a novel… and still ended up three feet short.\n\nThe layout is a perfect blend of “wow” and “why did I try that?” You've got elevated tee boxes that make you feel like Rory (until you actually hit), and water hazards that seem to be magnetically attracted to Pro V1s. I personally donated three.\n\nThe caddies are legends-equal parts golf whisperer, therapist, and comedian. Mine gave me a read on the 14th that was so good I sank the putt and briefly considered proposing.\n\nAll in all, Pineapple Valley is a must-play. It's beautiful, brutal, and blissful all at once. If you're a 12-handicap like me, expect a rollercoaster round filled with the full range of human emotions… and maybe bring a backup glove for when yours gets sweaty from both nerves and humidity.\n\nWould I play it again? In a heartbeat. Would I score better? Probably not. But at least I'd look good doing it.",

The park is a perfect size to feel relaxed and not frantic. There are lots of seating areas around the park. Also the restaurant is very well priced and the food is tasty. I recommend buying tickets online in advance as it is cheaper that way. Lockers are available free of charge with a 200baht deposit. Lastly, this place doesn't have the bigger rides or more thrill seeking rides like vana nava but there's more than enough to keep everyone happy. Oh and the wave pool was an absolute favourite.",

Very close by it's connected by an alley to the Patio which is a small square with tables, food and music as well. It's great to walk around and enjoy the vibe and then stop to have a bite to eat here and there. Easy to get to as the green Baht bus ends at the market. They have everything from savory to sweet, pizza to ice cream. You will not leave hungry. We went several times during our stay and never ate the same thing twice!!!",

The food was outstanding-every dish was crafted with precision and packed with flavor. The restaurant maintains impeccable cleanliness, and the service was top-notch, with staff who were attentive, friendly, and professional.\n\nOne of the highlights of my meal was a steak and beef dish, which was perfectly cooked, juicy, and full of rich flavors. Another must-try is their pizza, made with high-quality ingredients and a deliciously crispy crust.\n\nAdding to the experience, there is a bar conveniently located on the same floor, making it easy to enjoy a drink before or after your meal. Whether you're looking for a fine dining experience or just a great place to relax with good food and drinks, this restaurant is definitely worth a visit!",

We also shared two entrees. The tenderloin Rossini style was cooked perfectly - medium rare - and served with a rich and flavorful red wine sauce. The yellow tuna tataki was fresh and the portion significant, making it more than enough for an entree. Our servers, Bow and Por, went way out of their way to make our kiddo feel catered to and cared for, which of course makes any parents day. We'll be back again for sure. Thank you for the nice evening.",

It's an excellent choice of locale, as I can imagine how beautiful it gets during sunset. Although the Hua Hin side faces east, you can still catch a warm glow here and there.\n\nNow then, we were very excited to dive into authentic pintxos and tapas crafted by a Thai chef trained by a Spaniard. The first few bites of the razor clam were bursting with umami like your papi, but the bouchot mussel quickly brought a pause: why was the meat so stringy? Ah, it was overcooked. Way too overcooked. Being imported and frozen, the tough texture was a result of both freezing and the cooking time.\n\nThe octopus tentacles were well-executed, and the padron peppers were a hit. However, the biggest disappointment was the Paella Negra. Despite the rave reviews from others, it was far from authentic. The rice texture was off, and it lacked the characteristic aroma of the broth and the unique taste of squid ink. A total miss, as it should have been the highlight of the dinner. Room for improvement across all dishes needed.\n\nKudos, however, to Annie and the rest of the service team, who were attentive and lovely throughout the evening.",

            "text": "Off DPT. Prachuap Khiri khan 2002 road, there's a small road up a hill leading to Chao Mae Tuptim Thong Shrine, Racer Marina Hua hin and Pranburi Forest Park.  About halfway to the shrine, there's a shortcut with a sign reading \"Pranburi Forest Park\".  This small dirt road runs through a hilly jungle for a distance of about a couple of kilometers and ends near Bella Costa Hua Hin.  We decided to drive along it to get to the park.  It was all green all the way with brush and trees.  Surprisingly, we saw a peafowl and her 2 babies looking for food along it.  Then again, 2 more young peacocks and a couple of peafowls foraging in the brush!  We have no idea how they are raised or wild ones, but it's a pleasant surprise to see them.",

All 3 times have been amazing! The staff are incredibly helpful and friendly the whole way through. Our most recent stay was the most memorable as Marlene was available throughout the day to accommodate us with our needs. She was able to provide us with a baby crib, baby highchair and provide baby friendly breakfasts (included). They even cooked vegan and vegetarian food for us as my wife is vegan and our baby and I are vegetarian. Upon our request, Marlene also organised a cute massage for my wife and I in the villa.\n\nThe rooms we've stayed in are spacious with very comfortable beds. The bathrooms are big and one of the rooms we stayed in had a bathtub and an outside shower. They clean the room upon request or from our experience, every other day. There is plenty of space to hang and keep your clothes. A mini fridge and minibar are available in the rooms we stayed in.\n\nThe outside space is blooming with nature and looks stunning. There is a big swimming pool and spa, with some pool toys available for use. There is an outside eating area accessible any time. There is a communal kitchen which is open from the morning until the early evenings where there is a microwave, toaster, oven, kettle, and more! There are heaps of information about attractions and places to eat in the lounge room and Marlene is very knowledgeable about things to do in Hua Hin if you need any further information. I cannot recommend this place enough – do yourself a favour and enjoy this home away from home!",
