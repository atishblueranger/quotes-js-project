Large variety of seafood restaurants cooking out front and then you can sit at the restaurant. Very close by it's connected by an alley to the Patio which is a small square with tables, food and music as well. It's great to walk around and enjoy the vibe and then stop to have a bite to eat here and there. Easy to get to as the green Baht bus ends at the market. They have everything from savory to sweet, pizza to ice cream. You will not leave hungry. We went several times during our stay and never ate the same thing twice!!!",

Tourists can only hike up to level 5 of the waterfall now because many get stuck on the trail from level 6 to 15, which was disappointing since I wanted to go further.\n\nThat said, We spent a long time swimming in the amazing deep water at level 5. There were so many fish to feed and butterflies in every color imaginable – a magical experience! The hike up took around 30 minutes and was quite easy. Definitely worth a visit!",

The water is cool and refreshing.\nFood is not allowed after level  1 so make sure you eat before you go further.  There is a checkpoint after level 1 where you have to deposit your food to make sure no food goes further than level 1 but you are allowed to bring water.\nEntrance fee for adult foreigners is 300 Baht and for kids 150 Baht. For thai nationals it is 60 Baht and 30 Baht for kids. Vehicles are 30 Baht and motorcycles 20 Baht",

The area is excellent and a great atmosphere with lots of tables on the grass and cool beanbags on the deck area. The food was really tasty and most dishes between 100B to 250B. Great value and really good quality food ( not huge serves, but great value for money). Only disappointment is the prices of drinks. A small local beer is 150B ( usually around 80 to 90B) and all other drinks also expensive. They do a happy hour from 4 to 6pm with Buy 1 and get 1 free so maybe they have these expensive prices just for Happy Hour 😔.  So not somewhere you can relax on the beanbags and have 3 or 4 drinks, but definitely worth it for the great food and outdoor settings. Friendly staff, but not table service so don't expect it.",

            "text": "Off DPT. Prachuap Khiri khan 2002 road, there's a small road up a hill leading to Chao Mae Tuptim Thong Shrine, Racer Marina Hua hin and Pranburi Forest Park.  About halfway to the shrine, there's a shortcut with a sign reading \"Pranburi Forest Park\".  This small dirt road runs through a hilly jungle for a distance of about a couple of kilometers and ends near Bella Costa Hua Hin.  We decided to drive along it to get to the park.  It was all green all the way with brush and trees.  Surprisingly, we saw a peafowl and her 2 babies looking for food along it.  Then again, 2 more young peacocks and a couple of peafowls foraging in the brush!  We have no idea how they are raised or wild ones, but it's a pleasant surprise to see them.",
