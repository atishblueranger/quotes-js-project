The coconut juice was especially amazing-fresh and refreshing! The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful, even when dealing with some rude tourists who were completely out of line. They handled it with professionalism, which I really respect.\n\nOverall, it was a fantastic experience, and I'd definitely come back for another dinner. Highly recommend!",

The service was impeccable-attentive without being overbearing, and the staff went out of their way to make the evening feel special.\n\nThe food was beautifully presented and executed with precision. Each dish showcased high-quality ingredients and thoughtful flavor combinations. While not every plate was revolutionary, the overall execution was consistently strong, making for a very satisfying dining experience.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the genuine sweetness of the service. Little touches-like remembering I was with child or checking in just at the right moment-made the evening feel personalized and memorable.\n\nIt delivers a polished, enjoyable fine dining experience with heart. Highly recommended for a special night out.\n\nMalfi and the team were amazing, very personable and made us feel so welcome.",

Highly Recommend This Boxing Experience\n\nI had such an amazing time at the boxing match last night - seriously one of the most entertaining events I've been to in a while. The whole night was well-organized, super professional, and the stadium itself was absolutely beautiful.\n\nWe sat in the VIP section, and let me tell you - it was worth every penny. The seats were incredibly comfortable, the views were amazing, and the staff was super attentive the entire night. Everything felt elevated.\n\nThe crowd energy was great, very positive and in good spirits - no rowdiness, just good vibes all around. Restrooms were clean, and there were tons of snack and drink options, which made the whole experience even better.\n\nIf you're even slightly into boxing or just want a fun, lively night out, this is a MUST. Can't wait to go again!",

Out of all the fights, maybe two were interesting, the rest were a dreary and sluggish waste of time. VIP tickets get you... a synthetic t-shirt, seriously? And the beer inside is 150 baht for 0.33! Just highway robbery! But the cherry on top was the scam with the change. We gave a guy 200 baht for a beer, he promised to come back with 50 baht in change, and simply vanished! No matter how many times we tried to catch him, he pretended not to understand English and denied selling us anything. It's a complete rip-off! I request that this employee be dealt with. There's advertising for this boxing all over Patong, but in reality, the event turned out to be extremely uninteresting. And the most unpleasant thing is the blatant dishonesty. There's no air conditioning inside, only fans pointed at the VIP area, which clearly aren't doing the job. As a result, in an arena with several hundred people, there's simply not enough air to breathe, and oxygen is critically lacking! A terrible experience!",

The area around the Hide Out Restaurant is very good for swimming. Also by the Tri Trang Beach sign, a couple of hundred metres up from the Marriott, there is a shallow area where a lot of Thais go swimming. Numerous restaurants dotted around Tri Trang, most of them located up the hill past the Marriott.",

Its coastline stretches for a distance of about 730 meters - it is a medium-sized beach.\n\nYou can find a place in the shade - here they left a casuarina forest belt, which throws natural shade on the beach.\n\nThere are no sun beds and umbrellas, which would be available for rent. But there are swings and a local attraction - an elephant, with which you can swim in the sea. Therefore, it will be interesting and fun for both adults and children!\n\nThe entrance to the sea is very comfortable, the depth is average, the water is transparent. Here there are no low tides (watch the tides in the appendix) and you can swim all day long. The beach is notable for the fact that you can swim here in the rainy season, this is due to the fact that there is a reef, which dampens the waves before they come to the shore.\n\nFull information with video and easy navigation - in the app 👉 PHUKETON",

Dining next to the beach was therapeutic and the view was definitely a great bonus.\n\nGetting hold on the service staff was really difficult even though it was just a few tables. Not sure if there is anyone that was suppose to station outside as half of the time they were inside the restaurant. Food was slightly above average I would say. We sat there pretty long and the complimentary bread came quite awhile later. We didnt even receive any olive oil or vinaigrette to pair the bread with (we were suppose to receive it).\n\nI had the magherita which was okay. Wouldnt say it's super authentic, but I do still enjoy it. Had the bruschetta classica, tomatoes were fresh and thats about it. Should have ordered something with cheese on it that could elevate the dish a little bit. For pasta wise, I had the ravioli al granchio. The dish that stood out to me and I do enjoy every bite of it. It was full of crab and it was not too heavy on the palate. It was done really well. I also had the mafaldine, this was pretty much basic with just tomato base and lobster. Pasta was al dente and it tasted pretty much 1 dimension. Had tiramisu afterwards and this is not bad. However the cream layer on top is a little bit too much and didnt feel like the whole dish was balanced out. But other than that, it was creamy and rich.\n\nOnly giving a 4 star due to lack of service and attention. Could work on it. :)",

We chose this location as although it is close to the town of Patong meaning everything is accessible, the hotel and restaurant feels very private and secluded.\n\nOur wedding package included many amenities and personal touches that made it so special. The service we received from all staff throughout our stay and on our wedding day was absolutely incredible. They could not have done any more for us. Special thanks to Bright who co-ordinated our wedding and did an amazing job.\n\nThe food from the Lounge & Grill was beautiful. We were able to amend our menu to our taste and were able to offer a wide selection for our guests, all of which was cooked to perfection and tasted great. We also had an open bar for guests and the staff were very efficient and ensured no glass remained empty throughout the day.\n\nMe and wife and our family would like to thank all the staff of Diamond Cliff Resort and Sea Salt Lounge & Grill for helping make the best day of our lives so special. We look forward to returning here for many years to come to remind us of our wedding day.\n\nI highly recommend this venue for anyone looking to hold a wedding in Phuket.",

The place has beautiful views, neatly arranged tables, and a calm, pleasant atmosphere - especially lovely at sunset.\n\nThe first time we came, the sunset-view tables were all reserved. On our second visit, we got lucky and managed to get one without a booking. Both times, the restaurant wasn't crowded, which made the experience feel peaceful.\n\nThe food was tasty. I had a non-alcoholic cocktail on the first visit (really nice) and a cup of coffee on the second - that one was more of a “not great, not terrible” kind of thing.\n\nThat said, nothing really stood out as exceptional, especially considering the high prices. The food was solid, but the service felt average at best. One of the waitresses seemed quite unhappy during both visits. Not outright rude, but noticeably unfriendly.\n\nI'd still recommend this place - either solo or with a partner - for watching the sunset, enjoying a drink, or simply relaxing over a quiet meal. Just don't expect anything extraordinary, and be prepared for a few unfriendly faces among the staff.",

Everything was beautifully presented and very tasty. Staff were friendly, smiling, and kept everything replenished without us having to ask.\n\nThere are different seating zones to suit couples, families, or groups of friends.\nIf you're looking for a premium brunch spot in Phuket with great vibes and great food, I highly recommend this place.\n\n📌 Tip: Make a reservation in advance - it gets busy!",

In other words, we know a thing or two about good dining. Before coming to Phuket, I had made a long list of restaurants from the Michelin Guide, and while this place was on the list, it hadn't received as much praise as some others. So we weren't sure what to expect - but we were pleasantly surprised!\n\nFrom the moment we arrived, it was exactly the kind of atmosphere I had imagined from Phuket. A truly special experience from the very beginning. We let the staff guide us through the menu and followed their recommendations - and we're so glad we did.\n\nThe service, the ambiance, the food, the cocktails - everything was outstanding and worked together beautifully. We're grateful to the team for giving us such a memorable evening. Thank you for making our experience so special!",

The red rope was superb, beautiful room and prompt friendly service.\n\nFantastic show, amazing dancing amazing outfits and Amazing sets. I'm a big sound guy and it's the best theatre sound system I've heard in years. Thai, American, comedy, something for everyone. My favourite number was the Bollywood extravaganza. Just wow. Loved the exquisite hand control of all the 'female' lead dancers.\n\nI'd heartily recommend, but watch out for the 200baht per person per photo charge at the line up. Have one photo with two people and its 400 baht (£10 or 14USD), so that can easily rack up a big bill given a cast of 100s. Just walk past if you don't want to pay.\n\nMy video is of the pre show in the lobby. Video is not allowed in the show itself.",

I find myself to be a picky eater so I was a bit scared that I wasn't gonna like most of the food, but everything on the menu was so good, I loved every single thing that they served us. It is also a lot of food and big portions, so it's more than great value for the price. The restaurant itself has a really cool and unique vibe, right by the sea, it's perfect to catch a sunset there. The staff are exceptional! All of them were so kind and attentive, always smiling and just giving us so much positive energy. A big thank you to them for the amazing experience that we had there!",
