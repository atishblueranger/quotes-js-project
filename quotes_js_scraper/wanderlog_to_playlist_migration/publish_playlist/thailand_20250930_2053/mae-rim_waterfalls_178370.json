It's very easy to reach, just a short distance from the Chiang Mai Zoo and the Kruba Srivichai Monument, making it a convenient stop for both locals and travelers. The area is green, peaceful, and perfect for relaxing or enjoying a picnic. You can rent a mat, sit by the flowing water, and just enjoy the cool breeze from the forest.\n\nEven though it's not the largest or most dramatic waterfall in Chiang Mai, it has its own charm. In the dry season, the water flow can be quite low, but during and after the rainy season (July–November) the stream becomes stronger and more refreshing. It's a popular spot for families, couples, and solo visitors who want a quick break from the city without having to hike far. There's also a short trail leading to Wang Bua Ban viewpoint for those who want a bit of adventure.\n\nOverall, Huay Kaew Waterfall is not just a scenic natural spot-it's a peaceful retreat that's free to visit, easy to access, and well worth including in your Chiang Mai itinerary.",

The path to the waterfall is marked with blue ribbons along the way. Though some are hard to see so keep your eyes out. Just look for the signage every time you get to a fork in the road and you can't go wrong. It's about 2km to the waterfalls. We spent 2 hours overall including time to go in the water and walk there and back. We had a grab drive us through the reservoir and then park at the waterfall checkpoint/ start of the hike and wait for us as others mentioned it was hard to get a ride back. We only saw a few others on the trail and had the waterfalls to ourselves when we got there. Take a walking stick from the starting point as it can be helpful during some of the terrain. Overall well worth it! Seems like a hidden gem with hardly any tourists!",
