The craftsmanship and detail are truly impressive, and it feels very unique compared to other temples in the region.\n\nHowever, the ticket price is insanely high, especially for Thailand. Also, you're required to join a guided tour to enter, which honestly wasn't great. Our guide seemed to just make things up or tell random stories that weren't very engaging. We ended up walking away from the group - which I highly recommend. Otherwise, you won't be able to take proper photos, since the group moves quickly and keeps you in one area.\n\nOfficially, after an hour with the guide, you're allowed to explore on your own and take pictures, but by then, you're already tired and not in the mood. So just quietly disconnect earlier if you want to enjoy it at your own pace.\n\nOverall, the temple is incredible and definitely worth seeing once - just be prepared for the high price and the tour system.",

The place is not just beautiful but also deeply meaningful, with its philosophy and the Seven Truths of Life that can truly change how we see the world and make it a better place. The experience there was marvellous and very peaceful. It is also a fantastic spot for photography, with every corner offering something unique.

            "text": "I visited Art in Paradise last week and it was an unexpectedly delightful experience. This 3D art museum is so much different to usual tourist attractions. This is a place to visit for creativity, illusion, and a bit of fun photography, this is a must-visit if you anyone mentioned above.\n\nThe museum is divided into themed zones, from ancient ruins and underwater worlds to fantasy landscapes and optical illusions. Each section is filled with meticulously painted artworks that come alive through clever 3D / AR . The key here is interaction: visitors are encouraged to pose, act, and become part of the art, which makes it especially engaging for families, couples, and even solo travelers.\n\nStaff members are friendly and available to help with photo angles at the entrance. There are guides on the floor showing where to stand for the perfect shot, which is a helpful touch.\n\nI appreciated how well-maintained the facility was. Cleanliness and lighting were top-notch, and crowd control was decent, even on a weekend afternoon. You'll easily spend  2 hours here, especially if you're aiming to capture fun memories.\n\nOverall, Art in Paradise is more than a museum. Whether you're looking for a playful outing or Instagram-worthy photos, this spot delivers a unique blend of art and entertainment. Definitely worth the entrance fee.",

It was fun, and we made a lot of great videos.\n\nThe videos made through the app look cool. For the photos, I used standard camera, as photoes through the app were a bit blurred (though regular camera doesn't have 3d AR effects).\n\nIf you make photos with lion cubs, make sure to ask staff to use a standard camera on your phone and not the app. Otherwise, the photos will be blurred.\n\nThe kids were happy and we all had a lot of fun.",

Before doing anything stupid remember tiger is 6x stronger than a human and has\n\nBite Force:\nA tiger's bite force can reach 1,050 PSI, about six times stronger than a human's bite force of 162 PSI. This strong bite can crush bones and inflict serious damage.\n\nMuscle Strength:\nTigers have a more muscular build than humans, with developed deltoids and pecs. They can lift and carry prey up to twice their own body weight, with some estimates suggesting they can lift up to 1,210 pounds (550 kg).\n\nPaw Swipe Strength:\nA tiger's paw swipe can exert a force of around 10,000 lbs. This strength, coupled with their sharp claws, makes them incredibly dangerous in close combat.\n\n(source: google)",

Just please be careful of your things and be mindful of the rules and restrictions.\n\nToilets can be found near the entrance and at the middle of the park.\n\nTicket for foreigner is 500 baht but if you have your work permit with you (just show your work permit or a photo of your wp), you will only pay 200 baht.\n\nI will definitely come back amd visit this place again, I just hope I won't dream of crocodiles tonight.

I'm just a normal traveler who usually enjoys proper, well-run zoos and wildlife parks.\nBut visiting Million Years Stone Park in Pattaya broke my heart - and I feel responsible to warn others.\nIt was a mistake.\n\nAt first, the park looks impressive. But the truth behind the shows is heartbreaking:\n•\tThe tigers looked exhausted, breathing heavily, some making sounds that honestly felt like crying. Others didn't even move, which is not how a healthy tiger should behave. Trainers kept forcing them to open their mouths for tourist photos, even though they clearly didn't want to. Their eyes could barely stay open. It's obvious they are heavily sedated - they don't even bother closing the cages because the tigers are too weak to move.\nAfter my visit, I looked at photos online and realized it's always the same two tigers used for all the tourist photos. They are chained so tightly they can't even stand or lie down properly.\n•\tThe crocodile show was disgusting and made me feel genuinely uneasy, with handlers taunting and dragging the crocodiles around for entertainment.\n•\tThe elephants were chained tightly with barely any space to move - even after hours, there was nowhere for them to roam.\n•\tThe giraffes were standing out in the blazing sun with minimal shade for the number of animals, left to suffer in the heat and likely hunger.\n\nThe enclosures only look nice on the surface.\nWhen you really look, they are far too small, poorly built, and depressing - some cages are barely bigger than a bathroom.\n\nThis isn't conservation.\nIt's pure exploitation.\nThere's nothing educational or inspiring here - just sadness dressed up for tourists.\n\nDon't let the cheap ticket fool you.\nYou're far better off spending the same money at a proper zoo or a true sanctuary where animals are respected and cared for.\n\nIn 2025, smart, compassionate travelers are choosing better.\nCompassion is the new luxury - and true travel memories should leave you proud, not uneasy.\n\nIf you are human with a heart, and you believe slavery is wrong, then you should also believe no animal deserves to live this way.\nPlease don't support this cruelty.\n\nI deeply regret going there.\nNo one should be encouraged to happily take photos with an enslaved, suffering animal.",

Some cultural shows also happen there, which was interesting to watch.\n\nOverall, a good experience. Worth visiting if you're in Pattaya.",

It's beautifully designed to reflect traditional Thai architecture, and walking through the wooden bridges and canals really gives you the feeling of being in old-world Thailand. There are plenty of shops and stalls selling local handicrafts, souvenirs, clothes, and delicious Thai street food.\n\nThe boat ride was a lovely touch – cruising through the canals while seeing the market from the water added an extra layer of charm. There are also live performances and cultural shows throughout the day, which are fun and colorful.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that some parts felt a bit commercialized, with prices higher than usual local markets. It's also quite busy during peak hours, so coming early is a good idea to avoid crowds and heat.\n\nThat said, it's still a great place to spend a few hours exploring, taking photos, and enjoying authentic Thai snacks. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Pattaya and want to experience something traditional and family-friendly. A fun and scenic destination for tourists of all ages!",

            "text": "Cave Beach Club in Pattaya is a stunning beachfront spot with a beautifully designed, boho-chic interior featuring thatched roofs, bamboo accents, and cozy bean bags, creating the perfect atmosphere to relax by the sea. The Balinese-inspired decor and outdoor seating make it incredibly Instagrammable, and the ocean views are breathtaking. The food is delicious, offering a mix of flavorful Thai dishes, Western cuisine, and refreshing cocktails. However, the service can be a bit inconsistent-you may need to call the attendants as they pass by, and orders can sometimes arrive in a random sequence. Despite this, the overall experience is fantastic, and the ambiance makes up for any service delays. If you're in Pattaya, this is definitely a must-visit beach club!",

This was my daughter's first experience with cold and snow (they live in the Philippines) and it was a lot of fun for all of us. It's a must try. Little pricey if you add the photographing service, prints and souvenirs but well worth the visit.  The exterior has beautiful sculptures, the interior is so much fun for pics and videos and the walk next door to the ice cream shop and candy land make this a must visit place!",

            "text": "I recently visited Frost Magic Ice of Siam with my niece and overall it was a fun and memorable experience for children. Inside, the attractions were well set up and there were several activities that kids really enjoyed, such as playing snowball fights, riding on a sleigh, and sliding down on a big tube. The environment gave them a chance to experience something different, especially since the temperature inside is extremely cold at around -15°C. One of the highlights was that each guest received a complimentary drink, and after finishing it, children were allowed to throw the ice cup against the wall. This small activity was surprisingly fun and became one of the things the kids enjoyed the most.\n\nWhile the activities and atmosphere inside were enjoyable, one area that could be improved is the seating for guardians waiting outside. Many parents or relatives do not go inside because of the freezing temperature, and instead remain outside. Unfortunately, the waiting area outside was very hot and uncomfortable. It would be a great improvement if Frost Magic Ice of Siam could make the café near the ticket counter into an air-conditioned waiting zone. This would make the experience much more pleasant for everyone, especially guardians who cannot tolerate extreme cold.",

The variety of marine life is fascinating, from colorful fishes to unique sea creatures, all beautifully displayed. The maintenance is top-notch-clean, well-organized, and perfectly managed, which adds to the comfort of the visit. It's also very family-friendly and great for kids as they learn and enjoy at the same time. The glass tunnel and large aquariums are breathtaking highlights. Truly, it's a must-visit attraction in Pattaya that gives you unforgettable memories and a deeper appreciation for the underwater world. 🌟",

The underwater tunnel is divided into three zones, but there's not much to see in any of them. It might be okay for a quick visit if you have limited time, but don't expect too much.",
