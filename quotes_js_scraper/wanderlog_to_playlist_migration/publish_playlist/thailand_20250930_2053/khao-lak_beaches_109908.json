At first this distance seems nothing but actually the terrain can be a bit challenging and takes more time than you think. In pictures it's difficult to understand but it goes up and down and mostly nature trail, not stairs. Lots of roots, rocks, uneven steps. For elderly and kids, I'd say it's challenging.\nBe aware, on this trail you won't find a waterfall.\nThere are toilets, and one restaurant and at the beach one cafe. Trail is open until 16.30 and don't exactly remember the wording, but being out there after that time can bring you a penalty up to 100 000 baht.\n\nOverall we enjoyed the hike and the views.",

We were staying in Khao Lak but it worth the 10 - 15 minute journey heading north to get away from the crowds.\nThe sea was always calm and ideal for swimming.\n\nWe always used The Golden Teak restaurant and bar which is one of the first that you come to as the food and drink were excellent and the staff were brilliant.

The restaurants want you to eat in their establishment then charge you for sunbeds,, i personally think this is greedy. I sat under a tree as did a few others I ordered a chicken fried rice which was mostly vegetables and 3 bits of chicken I was told because its only 100 baht. Though they did offer to swap for chips as my little one wouldn't eat the chicken fried rice. There is a block of free toilets and shower to use which is especially important for anyone of the females that is on a menstrual cycle or anyone that has a wee problem.",
