They did stop me as I walked by (I had a backpack but no foods) but not in an aggressive way. Walk calmly to the other side if they stop you, not make eyes contact, prepare rocks or a stick just in case work for me.

Its coastline stretches for a distance of about 730 meters - it is a medium-sized beach.\n\nYou can find a place in the shade - here they left a casuarina forest belt, which throws natural shade on the beach.\n\nThere are no sun beds and umbrellas, which would be available for rent. But there are swings and a local attraction - an elephant, with which you can swim in the sea. Therefore, it will be interesting and fun for both adults and children!\n\nThe entrance to the sea is very comfortable, the depth is average, the water is transparent. Here there are no low tides (watch the tides in the appendix) and you can swim all day long. The beach is notable for the fact that you can swim here in the rainy season, this is due to the fact that there is a reef, which dampens the waves before they come to the shore.\n\nFull information with video and easy navigation - in the app 👉 PHUKETON",

Dining next to the beach was therapeutic and the view was definitely a great bonus.\n\nGetting hold on the service staff was really difficult even though it was just a few tables. Not sure if there is anyone that was suppose to station outside as half of the time they were inside the restaurant. Food was slightly above average I would say. We sat there pretty long and the complimentary bread came quite awhile later. We didnt even receive any olive oil or vinaigrette to pair the bread with (we were suppose to receive it).\n\nI had the magherita which was okay. Wouldnt say it's super authentic, but I do still enjoy it. Had the bruschetta classica, tomatoes were fresh and thats about it. Should have ordered something with cheese on it that could elevate the dish a little bit. For pasta wise, I had the ravioli al granchio. The dish that stood out to me and I do enjoy every bite of it. It was full of crab and it was not too heavy on the palate. It was done really well. I also had the mafaldine, this was pretty much basic with just tomato base and lobster. Pasta was al dente and it tasted pretty much 1 dimension. Had tiramisu afterwards and this is not bad. However the cream layer on top is a little bit too much and didnt feel like the whole dish was balanced out. But other than that, it was creamy and rich.\n\nOnly giving a 4 star due to lack of service and attention. Could work on it. :)",

Each dish showcased high-quality ingredients and thoughtful flavor combinations. While not every plate was revolutionary, the overall execution was consistently strong, making for a very satisfying dining experience.\n\nWhat truly stood out was the genuine sweetness of the service. Little touches-like remembering I was with child or checking in just at the right moment-made the evening feel personalized and memorable.\n\nIt delivers a polished, enjoyable fine dining experience with heart.

We chose this location as although it is close to the town of Patong meaning everything is accessible, the hotel and restaurant feels very private and secluded.\n\nOur wedding package included many amenities and personal touches that made it so special. The service we received from all staff throughout our stay and on our wedding day was absolutely incredible. They could not have done any more for us. Special thanks to Bright who co-ordinated our wedding and did an amazing job.\n\nThe food from the Lounge & Grill was beautiful. We were able to amend our menu to our taste and were able to offer a wide selection for our guests, all of which was cooked to perfection and tasted great. We also had an open bar for guests and the staff were very efficient and ensured no glass remained empty throughout the day.\n\nMe and wife and our family would like to thank all the staff of Diamond Cliff Resort and Sea Salt Lounge & Grill for helping make the best day of our lives so special. We look forward to returning here for many years to come to remind us of our wedding day.\n\nI highly recommend this venue for anyone looking to hold a wedding in Phuket.",

The place has beautiful views, neatly arranged tables, and a calm, pleasant atmosphere - especially lovely at sunset.\n\nThe first time we came, the sunset-view tables were all reserved. On our second visit, we got lucky and managed to get one without a booking. Both times, the restaurant wasn't crowded, which made the experience feel peaceful.\n\nThe food was tasty. I had a non-alcoholic cocktail on the first visit (really nice) and a cup of coffee on the second - that one was more of a “not great, not terrible” kind of thing.\n\nThat said, nothing really stood out as exceptional, especially considering the high prices. The food was solid, but the service felt average at best. One of the waitresses seemed quite unhappy during both visits. Not outright rude, but noticeably unfriendly.\n\nI'd still recommend this place - either solo or with a partner - for watching the sunset, enjoying a drink, or simply relaxing over a quiet meal. Just don't expect anything extraordinary, and be prepared for a few unfriendly faces among the staff.",

Everything was beautifully presented and very tasty.

            "text": "Kathu Waterfall is a popular natural attraction located in Kathu District, Phuket, Thailand. It is known for its series of cascading pools and lush surroundings, making it a refreshing spot for nature lovers and adventure seekers. Here's a detailed guide to Kathu Waterfall:\n\nKey Features of Kathu Waterfall\n\nMulti-Tiered Cascades: The waterfall consists of several tiers, with drop pools along the way. The first tier features a pool suitable for swimming, while higher levels offer scenic views and quieter spots for relaxation.\n\nStaircase Access: Visitors can climb up a 130-meter staircase to explore the different levels of the waterfall. The climb can be steep but is shaded, with rest stops available.\n\nNatural Beauty: Surrounded by dense tropical vegetation, the area provides a tranquil escape from Phuket's bustling tourist spots.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nThe waterfall is most active during the rainy season, from June to November. This period ensures a steady water flow and vibrant greenery. However, visitors should avoid heavy rains as the stairs can become slippery.   Kathu Waterfall, Phuket",

They do not push you to buy things and drink them quickly.

When asked about at least some information on how to do it, there was no clear response so we had to find out ourselves. We took a practice wakeboard and the staff at the machine is just so terribly unfriendly and does not give any instructions.\n\nI understand that this place might be more for \"professionals\", but the guidance for beginners is to cry for. On top of that, when asked for a simple receipt so that we could use it for our Thai company, they rejected to do that. They could not provide anything! May I remind the business owner that this is absolutely illegal. We paid for your service so we should be able to obtain a receipt somehow. Absolutely ridiculous.\n\nNice though that they gave a cheaper price when I showed my work permit. That is the only good thing I have to say.\n\nIf you are a beginner, don't waste your time to come here.",

Everything is very beautiful and green here, and on the sides, visitors are greeted by beautiful statues, sacred hieroglyphs and other signs and elements of Chinese mythology.\n\nThis temple is definitely worth visiting while on vacation in Phuket.
