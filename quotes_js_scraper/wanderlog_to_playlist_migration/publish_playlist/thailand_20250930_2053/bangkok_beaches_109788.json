There is only one beach here, Hat Tham Phang, over on the west side of the island, which does offer some nice white sand and swimming. It's also worth coming here though just to explore around the small island and its quirky temples, clifftop sunset views, and there is even an old colonial palace of King Rama V to check out.",
