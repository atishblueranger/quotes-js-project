The beach is lively yet never feels overcrowded, with plenty of spots to relax under the shade of palm trees or soak up the sun. Swimming is wonderful here, as the water is warm and gentle, and the shallow shoreline makes it ideal for all ages. We had intentions of visiting other beaches during our month stay but we just couldn't resist the convenience of Chaweng Beach.\n\nWhat makes Chaweng truly special is the balance between natural beauty and vibrant atmosphere - you can enjoy peaceful moments in the morning, then experience exciting beach bars, delicious restaurants, and charming shops just steps away. The sunsets are breathtaking, and it's located near Central Samui.\n\nWhether you're after relaxation, water sports, or a bit of nightlife, Chaweng Beach offers it all in one magical place. A must-visit when in Koh Samui!",

I fell in love with Masala Dosa years ago in India, when a taxi driver pulled over at a tiny roadside shack at 5 am and treated me to this amazing breakfast. Ever since, I have to eat it wherever I find it - so you can imagine how thrilled I am that it's finally available right here in Chaweng!\n\nLong story short: the food is delicious, the restaurant is clean and air-conditioned (huge plus in this heat!), and the waiter was so friendly and bubbly, he made the whole experience even better.\n\nGreat food, lovely service, cool inside - what more do you need? I'll definitely be back for my Masala Dosa fix. Highly recommend! 🌸",

A total rip-off – there's no service, the loungers are ancient, no cushions, and there's not even a water hose to rinse off after a swim in the sea. Exactly after 3 hours, they show up and kick you out.\n\nThey should take a cue from other resorts where usage is tied to consumption. After all, in this heat, you end up ordering something anyway. That would be a more customer-friendly marketing approach.\n\nThe beach was overcrowded, and snorkeling… well, there was nothing to see.",

The food was tasty and well-presented, and the extensive salt selection was a fun and unique touch.\n\nPrices are quite high by Thailand standards, but comparable to what you'd expect in Australia or other Western countries. Definitely worth it for a one-off special dinner, though not something I'd budget for every night. Overall, a lovely spot if you're looking for a more upscale dining experience in Koh Samui.",

If beaches had an elite club, Choeng Mon would definitely be on the VIP list.\n\nThe sand? Smoother than a Thai massage on a Tuesday. The water? So clear you'll start judging your drinking water at home. Perfect for swimming, floating like a starfish, or just dramatically pretending you're in a perfume commercial.\n\nAnd now… drumroll please… the real gem: that adorable little island (เกาะเล็กๆน่ารักมาก!) just off the shore! At low tide, you can actually walk across to it like some sort of tropical Moses. It's perfect for mini-adventures, selfies, or just yelling “I've discovered land!” to your friends.\n\nIdeal for families, couples, solo travelers, or wandering bat-creatures like me. It's peaceful, not too crowded, and has just the right amount of beach bars to keep your coconut hydrated inside and out.\n\nBatty's verdict: Beach level 10/10, would build a sandcastle again.\n“สวยมากครับ!” – That means “very beautiful”, and so is this beach.\nNow excuse me while I go write my name in the sand like a drama queen.",
