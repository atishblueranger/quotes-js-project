The beach is lively yet never feels overcrowded, with plenty of spots to relax under the shade of palm trees or soak up the sun. Swimming is wonderful here, as the water is warm and gentle, and the shallow shoreline makes it ideal for all ages. We had intentions of visiting other beaches during our month stay but we just couldn't resist the convenience of Chaweng Beach.\n\nWhat makes Chaweng truly special is the balance between natural beauty and vibrant atmosphere - you can enjoy peaceful moments in the morning, then experience exciting beach bars, delicious restaurants, and charming shops just steps away. The sunsets are breathtaking, and it's located near Central Samui.\n\nWhether you're after relaxation, water sports, or a bit of nightlife, Chaweng Beach offers it all in one magical place. A must-visit when in Koh Samui!",

If you want to have dinner, you can't sit at the beach bar and must be in the restaurant area, which is a bit disappointing if you hoped to dine right on the sand. The pasta dishes are overpriced for the portion size (about 550 baht for seafood pasta) and it's not very filling. The fire show is fun and definitely worth seeing but the service felt just normal, likely because the restaurant was completely full. Overall, it's a decent experience if you come mainly for the fire show, but the food and dining setup could be better.",

I used to know it from my lazy days at Sala Samui, and yep, it's still one of Ko Samui's top-tier beaches, right up there with Chaweng Noi. If beaches had an elite club, Choeng Mon would definitely be on the VIP list.\n\nThe sand? Smoother than a Thai massage on a Tuesday. The water? So clear you'll start judging your drinking water at home. Perfect for swimming, floating like a starfish, or just dramatically pretending you're in a perfume commercial.\n\nAnd now… drumroll please… the real gem: that adorable little island (เกาะเล็กๆน่ารักมาก!) just off the shore! At low tide, you can actually walk across to it like some sort of tropical Moses. It's perfect for mini-adventures, selfies, or just yelling “I've discovered land!” to your friends.\n\nIdeal for families, couples, solo travelers, or wandering bat-creatures like me. It's peaceful, not too crowded, and has just the right amount of beach bars to keep your coconut hydrated inside and out.\n\nBatty's verdict: Beach level 10/10, would build a sandcastle again.\n“สวยมากครับ!” – That means “very beautiful”, and so is this beach.\nNow excuse me while I go write my name in the sand like a drama queen.",

Instead of being treated as a guest, I was made to feel like a burden.\nThe staff showed zero interest in helping, and their attitude was cold, rude, and disrespectful throughout my stay.\nThis is not how you treat people who choose to spend their money and time at your property.\nI will never return, and I absolutely do not recommend this hotel to anyone.",

A total rip-off – there's no service, the loungers are ancient, no cushions, and there's not even a water hose to rinse off after a swim in the sea. Exactly after 3 hours, they show up and kick you out.\n\nThey should take a cue from other resorts where usage is tied to consumption. After all, in this heat, you end up ordering something anyway. That would be a more customer-friendly marketing approach.\n\nThe beach was overcrowded, and snorkeling… well, there was nothing to see.",

They were very expensive, but at least drinkable.\n\nNow for the downsides:\nThe connection between the pictures on the menu and the actual dishes is purely coincidental. The pizza tasted like gasoline, and the burger seemed like it was made by a 4-year-old child – simply inedible.\n\nAnd to finish it all off – the bill.\nOn top of the already outrageous menu prices, they added another 17%!!! That's 10% service charge + 7% tax, even though we specifically asked and were told service was already included.\n\nSo thank you, dear hotel, for giving us a “20% discount voucher” and then canceling it out with an extra 17% charge on the bill.\n\nHonestly, even without the price factor, this is the worst restaurant I have ever been to in my life. But when you add the price to the equation, this easily becomes the absolute worst place you could set foot in on planet Earth.",
