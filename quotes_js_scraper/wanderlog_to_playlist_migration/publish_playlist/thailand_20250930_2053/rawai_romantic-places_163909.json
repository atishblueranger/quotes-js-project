Snorkeling around the northern headland and rocky promontory was fantastic, vibrant corals and fish abound, with gear rentals at 100 THB. Kayaking to Koh Man, a nearby island, was a highlight for just 100-150 THB/hour.\n\nThe beach's laid-back vibe, framed by lush hills, is ideal for families and couples. Two small restaurants across the road, like Royros, serve tasty Thai dishes (200 THB) and refreshing coconut drinks.\n\nHowever, litter in the water was noticeable, and low tide exposes rocks, making swimming tricky. No sunbeds or umbrellas keep it unspoiled, but bring a towel for shade under trees. Parking is limited, so arrive early.\n\nDespite minor drawbacks, Yanui's charm and proximity to stunning viewpoints make it a must-visit for a peaceful Phuket beach day.",

Some dishes I found truly good, while others didn't quite meet my personal taste.\n\nUnfortunately, the atmosphere doesn't match the visual quality of the dishes: plastic chairs and tables, along with placemats that feel reminiscent of a cheap restaurant, detract from the overall experience-especially considering the prices. Another negative detail was the use of very low-quality olive oil, which was disappointing.\n\nA positive note is definitely the staff, who are always kind and attentive. However, there was an unpleasant episode with the owner during payment: while teaching a waitress how to use the POS machine, he became visibly annoyed when she struggled to tear off the receipt, sighing and shaking his head. It left a negative and unprofessional impression.\n\nIn summary, a restaurant with potential but some details that need improvement, both in the location and the service.",

Coconut Bar is conveniently close to our hotel. But for the 3rd time in a row we had reason to complain about the beer temperature.\nThis time I complained bitterly to the staff,  and explained that we won't ever be back.\nIn Thailand's heat and humidity you really do need a cold refreshing beer. Not possible at Coconut Bar when they have the refrigerator thermostat set at 5.7c. [Photo supplied].\nI cannot recommend this place.",
