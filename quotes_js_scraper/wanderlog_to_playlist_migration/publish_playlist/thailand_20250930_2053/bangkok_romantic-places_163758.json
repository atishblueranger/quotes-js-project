I advise to come early morning since it's not too hot and less people.\n\nThere are fountains with free drinking water, free toilets. You can have a rest in the shadow if you are tired of sun to continue explore the place.\n\nAdditionally it's a place where was born a real Thai massage so you have opportunity to get it there. I advise 1h massage with oil to get deep tissue massage, and don't forget to ask the blanket since air conditioner is too strong.\n\nYou can buy ticket only by cash.",

There are tons of tourists, but there are sections where you can go further to take a better picture. Mini shrines are throughout the building. There are other buildings on the grounds that contain various other golden Buddhas as well as a section that shows a traditional apothecary. One building has A.C., so my husband and I made a quick stop there to cool off. Worth the visit!",

It's an optional excursion; our tour company charges $40 (pp or for two), which includes the bus to and from.\n\nThe residence of various kings, including the current one, Vajiralongkorn (Rama X: 1952-). It's in the heart of Bangkok; each year, over 8 million visitors come. The site began in 1782 with King Phutthayotfa Chulalok (Rama I: 1737-1809),\n\nThe basement hall holding the tourists is big and clean with/ air conditioning, but the bathroom has no toilet paper.\n\nThen, we headed out to the complex, where it's crowded and hot.\n\nThe road to see the 26\" Emerald Buddha 玉佛 that is kept in Wat Phra Kaew (玉佛寺 wiki), is hard:\n\n~ wading through crowds to get there\n~ wait\n~ take off your shoes - remember the location\n~ wait in the crowd to get in\n~ where is it? ... oh really high up among the gold, clothed in gold\n~ follow the crowd to leave the temple\n~ fight the crowds to find your shoes\n\nTotally not worth it. Gold can be tastfully used but not at this palace: just gaudy.\n\nThe miniature Angkor Wat is amazingly beautiful. Many pots have rabbit imprints or carvings, because the 9th King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IV; 1927-2016) was born in the year of the Hare.\n\nI find a few enchanting corners that are beautiful and quiet. It's a much-needed relief.",

If you wanna see everything, prepare to arrive there at most at noon, preferably even earlier, because it's open till only 3:30 pm. Prepare for the crowds. They have a strict dress code (modest clothing) and it's respectful to stick to it. There's a map near the entrance, but I also downloaded one from the official website, to keep track of where I've been and where I wanna go next. Don't be afraid to ask others to take pictures of you (especially if you're traveling solo) and be ready to do the same for others. You have to enter barefoot into one of the halls, so either have a bag to put your shoes in, or leave them on a rack (but take pictures of the number of the row, where you left your shoes, to be able to find them later). Remember to have a hat, re-apply sunscreen and have wet wipes to clean your feet/hands.\n\nI was honestly in awe of everything, as it was my first time in Thailand and Bangkok. The architecture of the temples was stunning and impressive. While I was there, some of the paintings were being restored, so it was interesting to witness that process.\nThe Grand Palace is a must see place, to get a glimpse of traditional Thai temples, and culture as a whole.",

If you look close enough, you can see each piece of porcelain/other elements. They don't always match, but somehow they make a cohesive and colorful mosaic. Climbing it can be quite an exercise, but it's worth it.\n\nThe visitors have an option to dress up in traditional Thai clothes and use a professional photographer to take one of the kind picture (for a price of course). I'm not gonna lie, the garments looked stunning and exactly like those in historical lakorns. I was tempted to try them on, but it would take too much time and it was a really hot day. Speaking of which, there are stalls near the temple with foods and refreshments, and it was lovely to drink coconut water in such a heat.\n\nI arrived at and departed from Wat Arun by boat, which is a great way to do a bit of sightseeing by itself.",

It'll make for a unique and memorable souvenir.\n\nIf you visit, make sure to rent the Thai traditional outfit and take photos on-site.

Staff are very friendly when sorting your ticket out and a map is given of the area and all the attractions. They will also highlight some areas and give you the times for shows at certain areas.\n\nBest to do as a day trip as it can take 4-5 hours to fully explore and see everything.

The food options are also a highlight, there's plenty of delicious street food like grilled skewers, Thai iced tea, coconut ice cream, and mango sticky rice.\n\nPrices are generally affordable, and bargaining is expected, which adds to the experience. What I liked most was the mix of traditional Thai items and unique finds that make for great souvenirs.\n\nHowever, it can get very hot and crowded, especially in the middle of the day, and the layout can be a bit confusing for first time visitors, with limited signage. Despite that, it's definitely worth a visit. It's recommended to go early, wear comfortable shoes, and bring cash, as not all stalls accept cards and if they do, a 3% service charge is often added.\n\nOverall, it's a fun way to experience the city's culture and local flavors in one place.",

The museum offers a unique glimpse into the life and work of the American entrepreneur who revitalized the Thai silk industry. As someone who appreciates history and culture, I was particularly drawn to the authentic Thai architecture and the stunning collection of Southeast Asian art. The guided tour was both informative and engaging, providing a rich narrative that brought the history of the house and its enigmatic owner to life. I found the serene and lush gardens to be a perfect complement to the intricate design of the teak buildings.\n\nFor me, the most compelling aspect of the museum was the blend of traditional Thai craftsmanship with a distinctly personal, mid-20th-century aesthetic. It's a testament to Jim Thompson's vision and his deep appreciation for the art and culture of his adopted country. I highly recommend a visit for anyone interested in Thai history, art, and architecture. It's a place that not only educates but also inspires. The \"no wait\" experience I had made the visit even more enjoyable, allowing me to fully immerse myself in the tranquil atmosphere of this historical gem.",

The large open air area hosted traditional cultural Thai dances with many colourful/interesting costumes. There were several other huts or houses which exhibited interesting Thai culture type exhibits. Indoor there was a large auditorium which had shows and other entertainment. Staff were very courteous and welcoming. A great place for family entertainment and definitely worth its price.",

It has a gigantic stage and they made full use of it with a very immersive performance with multiple layers of stage prop that makes for magical experience.\n\nThe pre-show at 7pm sets the stage well with 3 sets of Thai dance performance. There's some arcade style stations at the courtyard, while a further walk inside will bring you to a mini cultural Thai village. You're able to feed the elephant at the courtyard, feed the fishes at the cultural village, experience classic Thai music and learn about a vast array of Thai culture there.\n\nOverall it was a fantastic experience. Recommended to get the upgraded seats to experience the best view at the centre, as the regular seats are placed all over the less-than-ideal areas. Not great when viewing the multi-layered stage prop.\n\nThe buffet was great too with a wide array of delicious dishes, though not necessary if you've already had dinner before coming.",

We got to see a wide range of well-kept animals, including marabou storks, ostriches, deer, wildebeest, zebras, rhinos, hippos, buffalo, lions, tigers (my first time seeing them!), and even bears. There were also colorful parrots from around the world, owls, hawks, giraffes, capybaras (the largest rodent in the world), elephants, chimpanzees, kangaroos, walruses, and countless species of fish-so many that I'm sure I missed mentioning some.\n\nOne of the most moving moments for me was interacting with the orangutans-we even got to hold them and walk with them! While the entry fee covers admission and food, you need to pay extra if you want to hold certain animals and take photos, which felt a bit pricey.\n\nThe park also features a number of shows. Though we missed the elephant show due to timing and the language barrier, we managed to catch the dolphin show, which was truly delightful. The included food, however, was very average and not freshly made, which was a little disappointing. On the bright side, I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the toilets were despite the huge crowds.\n\nFor families, the park provides carriers and prams for little ones-a must if you're covering the entire park, as it's quite a walk. There is also a map provided at the start, making it easier to navigate and plan your route around the park. Overall, the experience was unforgettable and absolutely lovely. The kids had a blast, and so did we!",

A true VIP experience from the moment we arrived. Staff were very friendly and led us to our seats. They also came around regularly throughout the event offering menus. The snacks, food and drinks were great. The MC was amazing and we loved the history show and the lighting and fights were all truly spectacular. The hubby and teenage boys were in heaven! We got free t shirts and the boys got to go back stage after the fights and have photos taken with the fighters, AMAZING! Highly recommend spending the extra money for the ringside seats.  We would definitely come again and HIGHLY recommend for anyone (couples, families, solo, groups) 👌👍💪🇹🇭❤️",

The stadium is well organized, with souvenir shops, clean restrooms inside, and snacks like popcorn available. If you sit close to the ring, you get VIP service: waiters take your order, deliver drinks and appetizers straight to your seat, and you pay right there while watching the fight. A highlight was the projection mapping on the ceiling and walls, which made the event even more special. I bought my ticket through Booking and the entry was super easy - my name was already on the list, and I just picked up the wristband quickly at the counter. Highly recommended!",

All very beautiful too.\nWe arrived about 5 it was quiet but by 5.30 it was getting busy, 4 would be a better time to arrive but definitely stay for the Illuminations after dark. Avoid weekends and holidays it's much better not too crowded. You have to wait for some photo opportunities even on a quiet day.\nOverall I'd go again especially with the grandkids but even as just an adult group. Very nice place with fabulous colours and well laid out.",

The entire venue is beautifully designed with so many scenic spots to click pictures-it feels like stepping into a fairy tale.\n\nAlthough it's a bit far from central Bangkok (around 1 hour or more by taxi, depending on traffic), the visit is totally worth it. You can easily spend 3–4 hours here exploring, taking photos, and enjoying the peaceful ambiance. Despite walking around a lot, it doesn't feel tiring because the surroundings are so enjoyable. A part of tickets is refundable in form of coupons for snacks.Highly recommended for families and photo lovers!",

The easiest way to get there is by Grab, but if you have more time, there's a more fun and enjoyable way! :) Take the BTS to Bang Na station, then go to Wat Bang Na Nok Pier and cross the river. On the other side, you can rent a bike or walk to the market, heading towards the Bangkok Tree House hotel. It's beautiful and picturesque-a completely different side of Bangkok! :)Enjoy🙏🙏🙏",

The facilities are top-notch: multiple steam rooms, saunas, water therapies, followed by professional massages, a lounge, and even delicious food options. You can also stay in the building, which makes the experience even more seamless.\n\nWhether you're with friends or family, this place is perfect for a day of total relaxation.

The atmosphere is calm and elegant, and the happy hour from 5:30 PM to 7:30 PM is a fantastic experience, offering a nice selection of drinks and delicious snacks. I would especially like to commend the lounge staff – Kathy, Pop, and Puri – who provided outstanding, professional service. Their attentiveness and warm hospitality made all the difference and turned my stay into something truly special.\n\nAnother standout feature is the pool area, which is beautifully maintained and perfect for relaxing after a day in the city. Whether you're swimming or simply enjoying the peaceful setting, it's a great place to unwind.\n\nThanks to the wonderful improvements and exceptional team, I have completely revised my previous negative opinion and am now looking forward to staying regularly at the Crowne Plaza Bangkok Lumpini Park again.

Whether you're enjoying a quiet brunch or a candlelit dinner, the setting is perfect for a relaxing meal.\n\nThe menu offers a variety of Thai and international dishes with a modern twist. I tried the truffle pasta and the grilled salmon - both were flavorful and beautifully presented. The desserts and coffee were equally impressive.\n\nIt's also a great spot for photos, with its elegant architecture and garden views.
