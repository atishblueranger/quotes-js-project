The toilets on the London floor are really cool, and have the Japanese toilets that are heated and have all the different squirting positions. The food hall on the top floor is fabulous. You have to buy a card with money on it to pay at all these food stalls, but don't worry you'll get refunded with the balance at the end of it. The prices of the food are so cheap and the ones that we tried were so delicious. It is worth visiting just for the food hall itself.",

It has shops of all sorts and ranges, from branded to local. Prices are fixed but they will give you discount. Some nice souvenirs shops are also available. Some restaurants are just absolutely amazing. It has movie theatre and sometimes there are events/shows going on in ground floor.

Located on South Pattaya Road just a short walk from Walking Street, it's a multi-story shopping center filled with mobile phones, laptops, accessories, cameras, gaming gear, and repair shops. I found a wide variety of options at competitive prices, and the overall vibe was busy but exciting. There are also good choices for second-hand items and affordable repair services on the upper floors.\n\nThe staff were generally helpful, and some shops offered solid guidance on specs and product comparisons. However, I noticed that the quality and authenticity of products can vary from one vendor to another, so it's important to check warranty, seals, and whether the shop is an official dealer. Bargaining is expected in some stalls, but major brands have fixed pricing.\n\nBeyond electronics, there's a McDonald's, Starbucks, and a local food court inside the building, which made the visit more comfortable. There's even a supermarket in the basement, so it's easy to combine tech shopping with casual browsing or a quick meal.\n\nOverall, Tukcom is a good place for tech lovers or tourists looking for electronics in Pattaya. Just stay alert, compare prices, and double-check before buying.",
