It's perfect for a picnic, reading a book, or just enjoying the breeze. Getting there involves a bit of a steep drive, so be careful on the way up.

From here, an amazing view of the island opens up. It is especially unusual to be here at dawn and after the sun has set, when the city is illuminated by hundreds of thousands of lights.\n\nIt is very green and beautiful here, and the air is fresh and healthy - that is why there is a fitness park here. Monkeys live on the territory of the park, which will beg for food - feeding them is not prohibited. There are interesting swings that are attached to the branches of centuries-old trees. In the gazebo, on the observation deck itself, you can cool off in the shade and get acquainted with the history of Phuket by looking up. Near the gazebo there are two cafes where you can dine while enjoying the beautiful view of the island.\n\nFull information with video and convenient navigation - in the application 👉 PHUKETON",

Today, we came to celebrate Father's Day with family and friends, and once again, Tree Monkey didn't disappoint.\n\nWe shared a spread of flavorful, beautifully prepared dishes. Some must-tries include the Steamed White Snapper in Chili Lime Sauce, the restaurant's famous Deep-Fried Pork Knuckle, Crispy Fish Salad, Roasted Spicy Pork Ribs, and for my son - a delicious Beef Bolognese.\n\nIf you're a coffee lover, don't miss their Espresso Coconut or the Coconut Smoothie Coffee - a refreshing and unique twist on your usual caffeine fix!\n\nWe chose to dine outdoors, enjoying a relaxing lunch with scenic views and live music from a talented Filipino acoustic duo that added the perfect touch to the atmosphere.\n\nA special mention to Mr. MJ, our server - he was attentive, always smiling, and very knowledgeable about the restaurant and the activities inside Hanuman World. His warm service made our experience even better.\n\nQuick tip: If you're a walk-in guest, make sure to register upon arrival. They do get a lot of bookings and reservations, but the process is super quick - just scan a QR code, fill in your details, and you're good to go!\n\nThis place is highly recommended for family gatherings, celebrations, or even just a chill hangout spot with great views and amazing food. We'll definitely be back again!",

The town itself is not that big so you can easily walk around it rather than taking any transport and has a large selection of restaurants to stop for something to eat.",

The buildings here were inspired by Sino Portugal architecture. Very attractive. Many buildings have converted into hotels, museums, cafes and restaurants cum bars. It was very very crowded even though many streets were only for pedestrians. One could find stalls of paintings, artwork, souvenirs and different type of food, fruits and exotic juices. At some place music bands were going on. In one of the lane there were about 30 chairs for foot massage. The entire area was lighted with colorful lights. It looked very pretty in the night. The ambiance was rocking. If you want to enjoy Indian cuisine then visit Amritsar restaurant.",

Walk calmly to the other side if they stop you, not make eyes contact, prepare rocks or a stick just in case work for me.

The tigers typically get fed at around 19:00 hours but it is also worth a visit when they open first thing to avoid the crowds. The kingdom has two restaurants on site should you be hungry, one of which allows you to look out at the tigers.",

I paid for the P-All package and was able to do the photos & videos with the Giant tiger, small tiger, medium tiger, large tiger & white tiger as well as the cheetah. I was scared but I was not going to back out! I am glad I did it & glad I got the staff to help me with taking my photos. The staff took amazing photos & videos of me & I could not thank them enough. I also had the photographer in one of the cages with me and they were able to send them directly to my phone and also gave me the USB for them. The wait was between 30 mins & 2 hours but we were able to walk right in after paying & receiving our tickets based on the wait list which was amazing. Overall we spent about an hour there which I thought was great because it was crowded. We got there about 11:30am. All of my pics & vids came out amazing. Some of the tigers were sleep but others were awake. I appreciated that. They also have great snacks to choose from. I had the gelato which was homemade & delish! The staff was great.",
