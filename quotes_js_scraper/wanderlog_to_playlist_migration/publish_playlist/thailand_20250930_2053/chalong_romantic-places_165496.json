The main Chalong Temple is built on three floors and there are stunning Buddha statues on each floor. The terrace can also be accessed to enjoy a beautiful view of the temple park.\n\nDon't be surprised when the quiet and austere atmosphere of the temple is interrupted by the loud crackling sound of fire crackers. At Wat Chalong, Phuket's largest Buddhist temple, visitors light these crackers in large clay ovens near the temple's sermon hall as a traditional act of gratitude. The practice stems from a belief in the spiritual power of the temple's former abbots - when prayers are answered, devotees celebrate by igniting strings of firecrackers, their sharp reports echoing across the temple grounds.\n\nThere are also some shops and eateries across the temple grounds. I would recommend this place.",

When I parked my scooter at the temple and looked back, I saw the mountain just behind it-it was such a stunning view.\n\nThe air there is very fresh, and the area is spacious. You can feed the fish in the pond, which is full of life, and there are also many birds around. I enjoyed playing with the birds-they're very friendly and make for beautiful videos.\n\nI was actually surprised to see so many tourists here, but I believe it's because they also appreciate the stunning architecture and peaceful atmosphere like I do. I think there are around 5 or 6 different temples in this area, each with its own unique style and different Buddha images.\n\nMy favorite was the tallest one-you can walk inside, and it has several floors. If I remember correctly, the first floor is filled with many Buddha images. On the second floor, there's a large white Buddha statue. The third floor offers an amazing 360-degree view of the surrounding area. And on the top floor, there's something very special-I'm not sure what it's called, but it seems to be a relic, possibly a tooth of the Buddha. It's interesting to watch people, especially Thai visitors, insert coins or bills as they make wishes or prayers for good luck.",

The main pagoda (Chedi) is especially impressive, as it houses a relic of the Buddha and offers peaceful surroundings for reflection.\n\nThe temple grounds are spacious and filled with ornate statues, detailed carvings, and colorful decorations, making it both a cultural and visual delight. Visitors will also notice locals lighting incense and candles, which adds to the authentic spiritual atmosphere.\n\nIt's a wonderful place to learn about Thai Buddhist traditions, pay respects, or simply enjoy the serene environment. While it can get busy during peak tourist hours, the atmosphere remains calm and respectful.\n\nDress modestly when visiting, as it's an active place of worship. Entrance is free, but donations are welcome to help with the temple's upkeep.\n\nOverall, Wat Chalong is a must-visit if you're exploring Phuket-not only for its cultural significance but also for its beauty and tranquility.",

The tour was both informative and fun, offering a behind-the-scenes look at how they produce their high-quality spirits. What really stood out is that their rum is made directly from fresh Thai sugarcane – not molasses – which gives it such a clean, smooth, and distinctive flavor.\n\nThe tasting session was the cherry on top! Each variety had its own unique character, and awards winning.  A lot of love and care goes into every step of their process.\n\nIf you're looking to do something a little different in Phuket – something local, laid-back, and delicious – this distillery is definitely worth the stop. A great way to sip your way through some Thai craftsmanship!",

OMG is what i have to say, surprises from start to finish! Our host and Captain the fantastic Igor Lofing was just excellent, he was informative, funny and so very charismatic!\n\nThis impressive sailing tour business is operated by Igor and his partner Delphine. The yacht was very intimate, with just 5 people on board. On the day we met the most delighful people from Germany on board and the whole day was fun filled, heaps of swimming and snorkeling in some of the best open yet safe waters at Coral Island and some other islands inbetween.\n\nWe got up close to heaps of marine life from starfish to every coloured fish imaginable. I can safely say and without any reservations, you WILL have a blast. One of the best travel experiences we have ever enjoyed!\n\nSo if you are ever in Phuket and looking for an exciting day out, then Sweet Dreamers sailing tours is THE answer for memories that will last a lifetime!",

Reduce your minimum spends or increase the quality of your food.\n\nDry & tasteless pizza 0/10\nFactory tasting super spicy crab cake 1/10\nLobster spaghetti...poor taste 2/10\nScallops see for yourself  0/10\n\nThe pool also overrun with loud annoying young men ratio 20 to 1 to ladies. Maybe you should consider couples only day use. Service slow, not on par for 5 star hotel with these room rates. View & pool/ facilities cleanliness saved the day for the 2 stars. Also no DJ all day (so far at 4pm) and day use guests playing annoying music on their personal speakers. Not recommended",
