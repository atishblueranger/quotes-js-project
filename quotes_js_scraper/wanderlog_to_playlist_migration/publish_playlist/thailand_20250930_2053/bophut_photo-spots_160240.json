It's a peaceful place that offers stunning views, especially if you visit in the morning or late afternoon when the sun isn't too harsh.\n\nThings to Keep in Mind:\n•\tDress Code: Since this is a temple, be sure to dress modestly-no shorts, bikinis, or revealing outfits. If you forget, some shops nearby may sell sarongs or cover-ups.\n•\tDonations: There aren't many ritual stations or activities like in some other temples, but donation boxes are available if you'd like to contribute.\n•\tParking & Facilities: There's some parking available inside the temple, but the restrooms are not in the best condition. Some stalls don't have locks, and some may not have running water-so it's best to use a restroom elsewhere if possible.\n\nThe temple grounds also have small shops selling clothing and souvenirs, which makes for a nice stroll. If you love cats, you'll be happy to find many stray cats around the temple. It seems that kind locals take care of them, but if you're feeling generous, bringing some cat food (dry kibble) would be a nice gesture. You'll find most of the cats near the restrooms, the front shop area, and even on the temple rooftops!\n\nOverall, Big Buddha Temple is a simple yet significant landmark on Koh Samui. It's not packed with activities, but the beauty of the Buddha statue, the spiritual atmosphere, and the adorable temple cats make it a special place to visit.",

Ie felt a but like being in a theme park rather than places like Bangkok. But worth a visit as not much in Koh Samui. We got a taxi to the big Buddha close by, then a tuk tuk from here to fisherman's village before a taxi home late in the evening.  Fantastic day out.\n\nFree to enter, bought some fish food, the fish and turtles were huge!",

While the statues are impressive in size, they don't offer much beyond a quick photo opportunity.\n\nThe most interesting part of the site is the main Buddhist temple located in the center, surrounded by a small lake. However, overall, the area feels more like a quick stop than a must-see attraction.\n\nUnless you have extra time to spare, this is one you can easily skip. If you're in the area, a short 15–30 minute visit is more than enough to walk around and take a few pictures.",

I used to know it from my lazy days at Sala Samui, and yep, it's still one of Ko Samui's top-tier beaches, right up there with Chaweng Noi. If beaches had an elite club, Choeng Mon would definitely be on the VIP list.\n\nThe sand? Smoother than a Thai massage on a Tuesday. The water? So clear you'll start judging your drinking water at home. Perfect for swimming, floating like a starfish, or just dramatically pretending you're in a perfume commercial.\n\nAnd now… drumroll please… the real gem: that adorable little island (เกาะเล็กๆน่ารักมาก!) just off the shore! At low tide, you can actually walk across to it like some sort of tropical Moses. It's perfect for mini-adventures, selfies, or just yelling “I've discovered land!” to your friends.\n\nIdeal for families, couples, solo travelers, or wandering bat-creatures like me. It's peaceful, not too crowded, and has just the right amount of beach bars to keep your coconut hydrated inside and out.\n\nBatty's verdict: Beach level 10/10, would build a sandcastle again.\n“สวยมากครับ!” – That means “very beautiful”, and so is this beach.\nNow excuse me while I go write my name in the sand like a drama queen.",

The location of this hotel is excellent, close to the beach, walking street and local market but far enough away not to be too noisy at night. The hotel is good value for money for fishermans village area. The staff are very friendly and helpful and the pool is refreshing.\n\nUnfortunately there are some negatives also for us. We personally found the beds to be way too hard, we stayed for 7 nights and woke up with sore hips, shoulders and backs. We know beds are hard in Asia but these were next level firm. We stayed in the purple building and found the walls to be extremely thin in the rooms. Unfortunately we had one guy next to us who was constantly talking loudly on his phone into the early hours of the morning. We were being kept awake until 3 and 4 in the morning, he also played loud music during the day which made the whole experience not relaxing for us. After 3 nights of this we did request a room change which was arranged and we had a much quieter stay.\n\nOverall I think the hotel has some good qualities and you can't fault the location.",

Upon entering my room, I was hit with an overwhelming chemical and air freshener scent that immediately triggered a migraine and nausea. I emailed the staff and kindly asked if it was possible to switch to a different room without the strong scent. They responded that I could move the following day.\n\nHowever, when I returned from dinner that same day, I discovered that someone had entered the room without my knowledge and sprayed a large amount of additional air freshener throughout, making the smell much worse. I felt quite sick and went down to the reception to ask if there was any other option for sleeping that night. They offered me a room between two large groups who had already received noise complaints, and I agreed, simply needing a break from the chemical exposure. That temporary room was more comfortable in terms of the bed, but unfortunately, it had no hot water, and the guests on both sides were loud through the night as I was warned. Their reception desk closes at 10pm every night, so there was no one to enforce a noise complaint.\n\nThe next morning, I returned to reception to ask what to do with my bags, as I was supposed to move into another room. The woman I spoke with this time was unexpectedly cold and visibly frustrated with me. This was really disheartening, as I had been polite and understanding throughout, and was simply following their directions. I had barely slept and felt unwell from the chemical exposure. Her unkindness was the breaking point that really stuck with me after an already difficult experience.\n\nAdditionally, there was visible mold throughout the bathroom of the final room I was placed in- especially on the ceiling which was actually collapsing in, and in the shower - and the floors of the room clearly hadn't been cleaned, with hair and footprints everywhere.\n\nTo be fair, I appreciated that the staff did make some effort to accommodate me by letting me sleep in a different room for the night and allowing me to keep my bags in the original room temporarily since they were on the highest floor. The first woman I spoke with was kind and sympathetic, she genuinely tried to help. But unfortunately, the overall experience left me feeling disappointed, sick, and emotionally drained.\n\nI wouldn't stay here again, and I don't feel comfortable recommending it - especially to anyone with sensitivities to chemicals, mold, or noise.",

That wil make getting to the cable car a safer hike up. The cable car was comfortable and very smooth.  The viewpoint is very nice and a wonderful place to see part of the island.  It does cost 200 baht per person. They have a bar and some appetizer at the lookout. We purchased a coke for 50 baht. We stayed and enjoyed the view for about an hour.",

Not a soul around which suited me. Sat for a good while just looking out, and watching the birds and insects. Nice way to while away an hour if like me you don't have wheels and are close by. Did see some people come up for the zip wire, but as it's really short, it wasn't for me.\nReally lovely staff.\nDidn't see the fish that have been mentioned in previous posts, so if you are looking for them, I think you'll be out of luck.",

They asked us to pay 100 THB per person, and the walk wasn't even enjoyable since there was ongoing renovation. If you want to take the cable car, it's 200 THB, and the zipline is 800 THB for maybe 15 seconds of sliding down. It felt like a total tourist trap with the restaurant at the top- I wouldn't recommend it. We also checked the reviews for Overlap Stone (200 BHT entry) and decided to skip it to avoid another disappointment. Save your time and money, they are better spots to explore.",
