Water is refreshing not freezing cold, also pools aren't deep (you'll have to sit or get on your knees)\n\nIf you want to walk and get to know the whole place leave your vehicle in parking #1, if not go straight to parking #3 it's short walk to area #4\n\nStarting from area #4 you'll find 3 beautiful small waterfalls in a row. It's worth it going all the way to area #10 (around 15 minute walk from area #4)\n\nToilets available in every parking lot #1 and #3. In parking lot #3 there are many places selling food.\n\nDate 13/3/25",

The staff and caretakers were all so lovely, the activities during the experience were fun and informative, but the best part was meeting the beautiful elephants.\n\nIt's really important to note that this elephant sanctuary is exactly that. A sanctuary. The elephants here are not for riding, everything is done on their terms and they are treasured and respected here, but you will have a lot of fun hugging, feeding them, and swimming with them. This was a wonderful experience and I'd definitely go again.",

What's particularly heartening is that there are no elephant rides here - instead, visitors are encouraged to interact with the elephants in a more ethical and respectful way.\n\nThe entrance ticket includes a basket of bananas and mangoes for feeding the elephants, which is a lot of fun. Each elephant has its own preference - some go straight for the bananas, while others absolutely love mangoes. It's amusing to watch their personalities shine through.\n\nThe camp is set in a lush, green environment with a gentle stream flowing through, creating a peaceful and natural space for the elephants. While it's hard to fully know how the animals are cared for behind the scenes, we truly hope they are treated with the kindness they deserve.

The experience is very hands on and everyone enjoyed making some paper as well as creating a craft with the provided materials (note there is a small fee for this).  The shop is also packed with lovely gifts and souvenirs made from the elephant poo products.  Highly recommend this as an educational and fun experience.",

            "text": "A very pleasant place to visit with children. You can learn how paper is made from fiber - in this case, fiber sourced from animal droppings. Everything is clean and properly washed, and it highlights an alternative, eco-friendly raw material. The guides are great at explaining the process, and at the end, there's a chance to take part in hands-on activities using the handmade paper. The kids absolutely loved that part!",

            "text": "A visit to the Elephant POOPOOPAPER Park in Chiang Mai is definitely worthwhile, especially for anyone who loves elephants. （There's NO REAL 🐘) The staff explain the entire papermaking process in great detail. It's fascinating to see how they turn elephant dung into paper!\nThe park also offers a hands-on activity where you can create your own craft, which is a big hit for families with kids. It's a fun and educational experience for all ages.\nAnd be warned: the gift shop at the end is amazing! There are so many unique souvenirs that you'll definitely want to buy. 🐘🐘🐘",
