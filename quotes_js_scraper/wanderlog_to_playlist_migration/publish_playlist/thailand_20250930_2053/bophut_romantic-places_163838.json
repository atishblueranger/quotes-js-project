It's a peaceful place that offers stunning views, especially if you visit in the morning or late afternoon when the sun isn't too harsh.\n\nThings to Keep in Mind:\n•\tDress Code: Since this is a temple, be sure to dress modestly-no shorts, bikinis, or revealing outfits. If you forget, some shops nearby may sell sarongs or cover-ups.\n•\tDonations: There aren't many ritual stations or activities like in some other temples, but donation boxes are available if you'd like to contribute.\n•\tParking & Facilities: There's some parking available inside the temple, but the restrooms are not in the best condition. Some stalls don't have locks, and some may not have running water-so it's best to use a restroom elsewhere if possible.\n\nThe temple grounds also have small shops selling clothing and souvenirs, which makes for a nice stroll. If you love cats, you'll be happy to find many stray cats around the temple. It seems that kind locals take care of them, but if you're feeling generous, bringing some cat food (dry kibble) would be a nice gesture. You'll find most of the cats near the restrooms, the front shop area, and even on the temple rooftops!\n\nOverall, Big Buddha Temple is a simple yet significant landmark on Koh Samui. It's not packed with activities, but the beauty of the Buddha statue, the spiritual atmosphere, and the adorable temple cats make it a special place to visit.",

If you want to have dinner, you can't sit at the beach bar and must be in the restaurant area, which is a bit disappointing if you hoped to dine right on the sand. The pasta dishes are overpriced for the portion size (about 550 baht for seafood pasta) and it's not very filling. The fire show is fun and definitely worth seeing but the service felt just normal, likely because the restaurant was completely full. Overall, it's a decent experience if you come mainly for the fire show, but the food and dining setup could be better.",

Went with family and loved it.\n\nGorgeous atmosphere, the restaurant is perfectly decorated to match the beach view whilst you enjoy your meal. Staff are very welcoming and friendly, make you feel at home and well serviced. Italian speaking staff too. Very clean venue.\n\nThe food is amazing quality. It is fresh and clean, very flavourful and well-cooked. Our highlights of the night were undoubtedly the Octopus with chickpea sauce, and the Duck ragu pasta.\nAlso lots of gluten free options (seemingly difficult to find around here). Very authentic food to North Italy.\nThere was no dish we were disappointed with!\n\nAdmittedly the prices were much higher than other restaurants we've been to, however the quality of food and service was certainly better than others.\n\nRestaurant is a little bit hidden on the street which makes location a bit tricky.\n\nAlso received delicious complimentary tiramisu for family members birthday!\n\nOverall best restaurant we have visited so far whilst in Thailand/Samui.",

Here, you're welcomed by open-air parks, breezy canopies instead of enclosed halls, and charming market-style shops in place of sprawling duty-free zones.\n\nThe moment you land, you're greeted with lush greenery, Thai-style huts, and even a large Buddha statue next to the runway - a serene, almost cinematic welcome. The airport staff is incredibly warm and helpful, adding to the whole laid-back, island vibe (then again, almost everyone in Thailand is wonderfully kind!).\n\nThis isn't just an airport; it's a destination in itself. You'll find bean bags, hammocks, lounge chairs, and the occasional shaded bench - creating a peaceful blend of comfort and nature. It's the kind of place where you wouldn't mind a delayed flight.\n\n♿ Wheelchair Accessibility: The entire airport is on one level and fully wheelchair accessible. Whether you're arriving or departing, navigation is smooth and hassle-free.\n\nEven if you're not flying, this is a space where you can park your car, sip fresh coconut water, and watch flights take off against a backdrop of palm trees. It's surreal, calming, and refreshingly un-airport-like.",

Also be there a bit earlier to enjoy a nice drink at the bar before dinner.\nOur table had been decorated cozy and personally. The food itself was lovely and a very special choice of earth and sea delicacies. 100/100 points!\nIf there is any negative point, please be aware that prices do not include 7% vat and 10% service fee, which wasn't mentioned when booking and even making the deposit on the website to guarantee the booking. It didn‘t really affect our beautiful experience, but it would be good to clearly know in advance. Still worth of 5 stars for us!",

We had the tuna tacos and the lamb shank. They were both well plated and absolutely delicious. The lamb shank was literally the best lamb shank I've ever had in my life...and I've had quite a few. The restaurant is moderately priced. Definitely not one of the cheapest on the island, but also not among the most expensive. For us we were thrilled with our experience and it was well worth every baht! We will definitely return next time we are back on the island.",

The worst is the food! For this place, one Pad Thai cost 180! One coke cost 60! And the rice for 30 and it's cold! The food added a lot of salt and sauce and the portion is so so small! I think it's from the refrigerator some days ago cause there were nobody in the restaurant ! There are no other choice nearby otherwise I will never come in !",

It is a beautiful and peaceful spot where employees are extremely friendly and capable. My masseuse was Apple 🍏 and she is really great at what she does. I felt extremely relaxed after her treatments. They welcome you with a refreshing Thai drink, ask about your preferences and medical history. After the intake you are brought to a massage room where you can refresh and change. Upon the completion you receive a complimentary drink. It was a fantastic experience! 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼",
