I suggest visiting this one, which is in the western mountains, reachable within half an hour drive from downtown.\nIt's a magnificent Temple with many Buddha statues - sitting, standing and reclining. Besides, it offers great city views beneath you from the viewing terrace",

Not a ton of shade, and the sun bakes the white tiles which reflect back to you. Definitely be prepared with water, electrolytes, sunscreen, and a hat. A portable fan wouldn't hurt either.\n\nIf you want to hike to the top, you have to get dropped off at the parking lot/market across from Cup Fine Day. Keep in mind that it is more than just the dragon stair case you'll have to climb. There's about 300 steps through the forest and the staircase itself is about 180. There's a sign that says it's 1.5 kilometers, but that seemed like too much. It's really quite short, but it's steep.\n\nIf you're not up for the hike but still want to take the dragon stairs, you'll have to get dropped off at the top of the temple and then walk down the stairs to walk up them. There's not car drop-off zone at the bottom of the staircase.\n\nIf you can, we definitely recommend the whole hike :) the forest is beautiful and you'll see some cool animals. We saw a peacock!!",

It is low tourist season now (June).\nMust wear temple appropriate clothing (cover knees and shoulders) you must take off your shoes before entering the main part of the temple. You can take pictures inside, no problem.\n\nTemple/ Wat: Stunning architecture, painting and attention to detail. It felt very peaceful within the temple, lots of people were praying or meditating and paying respects.\n\nThe Park/Grounds: The grounds surrounding were well maintained.\nGood clean facilities.\nLots of view points to take photos.\nMany souvenir shops and some restaurants/ food stalls at the entrance.\n\nSteps: There are a set of steps that take about 5 minutes to ascend (steep but slow walking) to the start of the temple, if you are not able to do, you can take a cable car/ lift.\n\nTransport: I booked a grab from the city centre and he messaged us to ask if we wanted him to wait for us and drive us back. So it's easy to negotiate a full trip price, most grab/ bolt drivers are happy to do that.\nThere were many Tuk Tuk and Song Thaews available once you're up there to take you back too. Some people drive motorbikes up which has a great view but I would only recommend if you were experienced as the road is very windy and quite steep. It's also rainy season and rained whilst we were there so could make the road slippery.",

The free shuttle bus service is useful for moving between gardens. Shuttle bus leaves every 15-20 minutes - convenient for using the shuttle to move between gardens. Plan on being here for at least 3 hours. The Skywalk is good for seeing the Park from above the ground - there's a ramp up, as well as stairs. Wheelchair friendly - there was wheelchairs to hire at the ticket selling area. We didn't see the whole Park on our visit, and will come back again to see the parts we missed.\nThere is plenty of parking - take the ticket you're given to the ticket selling booth and have it stamped/validated for free parking.\nEntry is ฿200 for foreigners - well worth it.\nThere's 1 small cafe selling drinks and snacks. There is a restaurant - we didn't go there.",

The meaning of this festival is for people to express their respect to the gods and pray for good luck and prosperity in life.\nThe Lantern Festival originated from the Lanna belief that if you worship the Buddha's relics during the full moon of the 12th lunar month, you will receive blessings. However, the Buddha's relics are said to be kept in the highest level of heaven, so the Lanna people lit lanterns and released them into the sky to send their wishes.",

It's very easy to reach, just a short distance from the Chiang Mai Zoo and the Kruba Srivichai Monument, making it a convenient stop for both locals and travelers. The area is green, peaceful, and perfect for relaxing or enjoying a picnic. You can rent a mat, sit by the flowing water, and just enjoy the cool breeze from the forest.\n\nEven though it's not the largest or most dramatic waterfall in Chiang Mai, it has its own charm. In the dry season, the water flow can be quite low, but during and after the rainy season (July–November) the stream becomes stronger and more refreshing. It's a popular spot for families, couples, and solo visitors who want a quick break from the city without having to hike far. There's also a short trail leading to Wang Bua Ban viewpoint for those who want a bit of adventure.\n\nOverall, Huay Kaew Waterfall is not just a scenic natural spot-it's a peaceful retreat that's free to visit, easy to access, and well worth including in your Chiang Mai itinerary.",

            "text": "Wat Saen Muang Ma Luang, also known as Wat Hua Khwuang, is a hidden gem in Chiang Mai that combines Burmese and traditional Thai (Lanna) architectural elements. The temple features a striking main viharn (hall) with a multi-tiered roof, adorned with decorative naga (serpent) balustrades and intricate golden carvings. The red entrance doors depict the Hindu god Indra, adding a unique cultural touch. Visitors are greeted by lifelike elephant statues and large black elephant sculptures, lending a distinct character to the entrance.\n\nOne of the most notable structures is the ancient brick chedi, which has a weathered appearance, enhancing the temple's historical ambiance. Although some buildings are newer, the complex maintains traditional designs, such as the richly decorated windows featuring zodiac animals. Within the peaceful garden areas, there are also three ornate bell towers (ho rakangs), and the grounds are adorned with colorful murals and statues.\n\nThis temple is a tranquil retreat from the more crowded tourist spots, making it a must-see for those interested in Chiang Mai's spiritual and architectural heritage.",
