The clouds rolling over the lush green hills, the ocean shimmering in muted silver tones, and the soft breeze made the whole scene feel like a dream. There's something so calming and cinematic about standing up there in the rain, watching nature do its thing.\n\nThe spot itself is easy to reach and not too crowded (especially when the weather isn't sunny – lucky me!). There's a quiet energy to the place, and the windmill adds a charming touch to the landscape.\n\nIf you're in Phuket and thinking of skipping this viewpoint just because it's not all sunshine and blue skies – don't.

Snorkeling around the northern headland and rocky promontory was fantastic, vibrant corals and fish abound, with gear rentals at 100 THB. Kayaking to Koh Man, a nearby island, was a highlight for just 100-150 THB/hour.\n\nThe beach's laid-back vibe, framed by lush hills, is ideal for families and couples. Two small restaurants across the road, like Royros, serve tasty Thai dishes (200 THB) and refreshing coconut drinks.\n\nHowever, litter in the water was noticeable, and low tide exposes rocks, making swimming tricky. No sunbeds or umbrellas keep it unspoiled, but bring a towel for shade under trees. Parking is limited, so arrive early.\n\nDespite minor drawbacks, Yanui's charm and proximity to stunning viewpoints make it a must-visit for a peaceful Phuket beach day.",

My daughter had the chicken and fries, a huge portion of chicken that looked delicious but was quite dry. The burger was great but the fries were overcooked and burnt.

A fun off-road adventure that only adds to the experience-unless, of course, you believe every paradise should come with a four-lane highway.\n\nNow, let's clear up some misunderstandings: Nui Beach, like all beaches in Thailand, is part of the kingdom's natural beauty and is open to everyone. You're free to enjoy the sand and sea at no cost. However, the sunbeds, bar, and other facilities are privately maintained, and naturally, access to these comforts comes with a fee-just as you'd expect anywhere that provides quality service in a beautiful setting.\n\nSome visitors seem surprised that a remote beach club isn't running as a charity, but for those who appreciate a well-kept paradise and don't mind supporting the people who make it special, Nui Beach is more than worth it. If adventure, exclusivity, and stunning scenery sound like your kind of day, you'll love it here as much as we did!\n\nAnd a special mention: the owner's replies to brainrotted reviews are truly a gem of their own -some of the best communication I've seen, pure and honest. That alone makes this appreciation review worth writing. Recommended 🥰\n\n(If you disagree; get yourself checked, mentally.)",

I did make it on a scooter, so it is possible on a scooter or motorcycle, however I would not recommend this for a novice rider.  The terrain is very steep with lots of rocks and washouts.  Also be warned they have started collecting a fee to visit and a little man literally sprinted to me with his hand out to collect the 100 baht fee before I could even park and get off my bike.  They then added a 20 baht \"parking\" fee.  The whole thing was very scam-y.  In the big picture the fee and risk of personal injury is probably worth it to access the beach.  The whole place has a very pirate vibe with several bars and great picture points.  They have spent lots of time and energy to decorate it very well.  Overall...worth it...if you are aware of the risk and cost!",

Far from the crowds, amazing views, crystal clear water, and lots of beautiful fishes if you fancy an improvised snorkeling session. The way to the beach is very steep and bumpy. So you might want to hike there (or drive you scooter if you have good suspensions). Also, locals provide 4x4 taxi and ATV services. The journey through the jungle is worth it.",

Coffee is just like any other Starbucks but you don't really come here looking for specialty coffee. Service was good and the staff tries their best to communicate with customers considering that the clientele comes from all over the world. A solid spot if you are just looking for US style coffee in a familiar setting.",
