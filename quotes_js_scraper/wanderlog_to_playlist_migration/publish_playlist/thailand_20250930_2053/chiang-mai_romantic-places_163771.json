This charming Buddhist temple and monastery may not boast the grandeur of some other temples in Chiang Mai, but its true beauty lies in its tranquil woodland setting. Accessible via a scenic hiking trail, visitors are greeted by lush greenery and soothing sounds from nearby waterfalls.",

Nestled in the forest, it's serene, beautiful, and full of history.\n\nI walked a short part of the Monk's Trail before rain poured down - Chiang Mai showers are no joke! The mist, waterfalls, and forest sounds made the temple feel even more magical.\n\nA perfect spot to slow down, breathe, and find peace. Highly recommended! 💚",

We chose to hike the Monk's Trail, which is a scenic walk through the jungle, not too difficult, but it gets warm in the heat, so don't forget to bring a bottle of water. Taking it slow, we enjoyed spotting birds, spiders, and other insects along the way; it's a lovely mini-adventure for nature lovers. The temple complex itself is absolutely beautiful, set right in the middle of lush greenery and dramatic jungle scenery. If you love photography, you'll be in heaven! When we arrived, clouds rolled in and transformed the whole place into something mystical with the perfect light for taking stunning photos. The temples, statues, and deities are all incredible to see up close.\n\nOne of the best parts was how peaceful it felt. We visited during the off-season (mid-August), and there were hardly any other people around, especially on the trail, so it felt like we had this magical spot almost to ourselves. After exploring, we took a taxi back to the city to escape the midday heat and to avoid a long walk down (especially if you don't want to hike back the same way). Highly recommended for a bit of adventure and a lot of beauty at one of Chiang Mai's true hidden gems!",

So much original stuff that I haven't seen at other markets in SE Asia. Pretty busy but still easy to walk around without bumping into other people. We got a hair stick, bbq sausage (not my favorite), bbq chicken & mochi (bit different than Japanese mochi), mango & passionfruit smoothie & kimchi pancakes (delicious).",

There are lots of food options, and some carts also provide seating (there are specific tables/chairs belonging to stalls so it's best to ask them to find you seats if you wish to order from them). We ordered bbq squid from the stall and could also eat some other food at the table (they were very nice and didn't ask us otherwise). We saw some people looking for a seat, so we finished ours quickly and offered it to them.\n\nYou can have a full meal at this place, tom yum soups or noodles, meat skewers, bbq seafood, juices, cakes, sushi, toasts etc. I recommend that you could walk around and buy food as you go, and eventually find a stall that has seating so that you can sit comfortably to enjoy them all. Do be gracious and not hold up the table if there are others waiting, so that the stallholders can have more turnover.\n\nAfter filling your stomachs, walk around to purchase souvenirs, clothing etc there are many!",

It is low tourist season now (June).\nMust wear temple appropriate clothing (cover knees and shoulders) you must take off your shoes before entering the main part of the temple. You can take pictures inside, no problem.\n\nTemple/ Wat: Stunning architecture, painting and attention to detail. It felt very peaceful within the temple, lots of people were praying or meditating and paying respects.\n\nThe Park/Grounds: The grounds surrounding were well maintained.\nGood clean facilities.\nLots of view points to take photos.\nMany souvenir shops and some restaurants/ food stalls at the entrance.\n\nSteps: There are a set of steps that take about 5 minutes to ascend (steep but slow walking) to the start of the temple, if you are not able to do, you can take a cable car/ lift.\n\nTransport: I booked a grab from the city centre and he messaged us to ask if we wanted him to wait for us and drive us back. So it's easy to negotiate a full trip price, most grab/ bolt drivers are happy to do that.\nThere were many Tuk Tuk and Song Thaews available once you're up there to take you back too. Some people drive motorbikes up which has a great view but I would only recommend if you were experienced as the road is very windy and quite steep. It's also rainy season and rained whilst we were there so could make the road slippery.",

The range is exceptional and one is spoilt for choice. Freshly prepared food is definitely a highlight and the pricing is affordable even for the locals.

This small but exquisite temple stands in the shadow of the grand Wat Chedi Luang but holds its own with a unique character and fewer crowds.\n\nThe highlight is the **golden teakwood *viharn* (prayer hall)**, a masterpiece of Lanna craftsmanship. Inside, you'll find a serene golden Buddha image and intricate wooden carvings that glow in the soft light filtering through the windows. The temple's **tranquil garden setting**, with lush plants and a quiet courtyard, makes it perfect for meditation or a moment of calm.\n\nUnlike larger temples, Wat Phantao retains an **authentic, unhurried vibe**. You'll often see monks quietly going about their daily routines or locals stopping by to pray. The absence of entrance fees and tourist crowds adds to its understated beauty.\n\nFor lovers of **traditional Lanna architecture and quiet spirituality**, this temple is a 5-star must-see. Its intimate scale and timeless elegance offer a refreshing contrast to Chiang Mai's busier landmarks.\n\n**Tip:** Visit early morning or late afternoon for the best light on the teakwood carvings. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\n*Bonus: Located right next to Wat Chedi Luang-pair them for a perfect temple-hopping combo!*",

The atmosphere was calm and relaxed, quite a contrast to the busy terminals in Bangkok.\n\nWhat really stood out was the hospitality of the airport staff. Everyone I interacted with was friendly, polite, and ready to assist, which made the arrival experience very comfortable.\n\nBaggage claim was quick, signs were clear, and it didn't take long to reach the exit.

Its biggest advantage is location-just a short drive from the city center-making it one of the most accessible airports in the country. Arrivals and immigration are usually smooth and efficient, with friendly staff who maintain a clean and organized environment. The airport is compact, easy to navigate, and generally hassle-free compared to much larger airports.\n\nHowever, with passenger numbers increasing every year, the airport is beginning to feel outdated. During peak times, long queues can form at check-in and security, and seating space becomes limited. Dining and shopping options inside the terminal are quite basic, with limited variety and higher-than-average prices. The single runway also restricts capacity, raising concerns about handling larger aircraft and more frequent flights as tourism grows.\n\nFor the future, it would be wonderful to see upgrades that match the city's growing reputation. Expanding the terminal, improving facilities, and adding more comfortable lounges and food choices would enhance the passenger experience. With its beautiful setting surrounded by green hills, the airport could also take inspiration from Zurich Airport, blending modern infrastructure with natural landscaping to create a more refreshing, world-class gateway to Chiang Mai.",

When making the reservation, I  mentioning it was my spouses birthday; at the table there was a nice bday card signed by David. We chose the 4 course set menu and everything was delicious. Staff and service were equally fantastic. Unfortunately, I was feeling a bit off during the day and needed to leave before we got to dessert. David quickly offered his restaurant's personal car service to brings us back to our hotel. If you find yourself in Chiang Mai and enjoy great culinary experiences this establishment will be a great highlight to your visit.",

We were greeted by the owner David and his wife. Then the server guided us to our table which was decorated with personal touch for our anniversary. We loved the signature pumpkin soup the most. After that, we were given a complimentary cocktail at the new bar Piccolo next door. Definitely recommend checking the bar out.

The host/drivers picked us up on time and were so accommodating. Koko and dodo(if correct) led such a great experience. Seeing the way they treated the elephants was beyond beautiful. Those elephants are their family. No whips, no chains no abuse. They have free range chickens and a kitty who loved my son. These gentlemen were so sweet and gentle with my 4 year old son, it made my experience so comfortable.  If I could give this family a 100 stars I would! The best place for an elephant sanctuary.  They played with us in the mud and river. We never felt scared. It was such a beautiful time. Thank you guys for the best time ever!!!",

They both play good music and there's always people on the dance floor.\n\nThe drinks look amazing! Normally I only order Gin Tonic but I tried the Zombie shot with Nat a guy who was also there chilling.\n\nAround the corner you also have other bars. All of them playing different types of music. There's also a food outdoor market where you can sit and eat too. It's quite nice. I ate there each time I went. The food is great and the prices pretty cheap.\n\nZoe in Yellow is a cool place to meet people. Every foreigner I met was friendly and had some interesting conversations.

It is a stunning, peaceful oasis, but close enough to be able to walk to downtown Chiang Mai.  We loved our beautiful rooms and had amazing sleep, and especially loved the large balcony.  We had a connecting room via balcony with our kids, and we all said this was the most restful sleep we had on our whole trip!  The breakfast was wonderful, and we really loved the pool, too!  We wished we could have stayed longer than just two nights, but we'll never forget the piano music drifting through the air in the evenings and the quiet mornings looking out over the grounds from our balcony with coffee.  Their staff go above and beyond and organized everything for us so that we could truly just let go and experience our vacation, it was seamless!",

From the minute we checked in, our butler Toto provided 5 star service to the moment we left. He was truly wonderful and took care of everything for us. Even provided fantastic local food recommendations. The grounds of this hotel are stunning and well maintained. Breakfast was so good! My husband loved the omelette stand and fresh juices each morning. I miss this hotel so much. Note to self, buy the robe!! The robes back home don't compare and I wish I'd purchased one. I will definitely be back one day!!",

The intricate details of the architecture, especially the main viharn and its golden highlights, are stunning. The temple grounds are well-maintained and have a serene atmosphere, ideal for reflection. While it's not as grand as some of Chiang Mai's more famous temples, its charm lies in its simplicity and cultural authenticity. A lovely stop for anyone exploring the city.\nThe entrance fee is 30 Thai baht.",

It's an open air spot which makes the place feel very open and there are fans to keep the place relatively cool.\n\nWe ordered the fresh spring roll and the yellow pumpkin curry with rice. The pumpkin curry was surprisingly very light which was a nice change from some of the heavier curries I've had recently. The fresh spring roll was also super delicious. It was filled with a lot of fresh vegetables and mango. It comes with twi sauces: a spicy chili one and a creamy peanut. The combination of sweet from the mango, spice from the chili, and the cream from the peanut sauce was just perfect :) the curry portion was on the smaller side but I feel very satisfied and good after the meal.\n\nThe pineapple shake was also nice. Unlike some places that feel like they fill up the shake with ice, this place's shake was very flavorful and naturally sweet. Can't wait to come back and eat here again!\n\nPs there is wifi here which is always a huge plus :)",

It's very easy to reach, just a short distance from the Chiang Mai Zoo and the Kruba Srivichai Monument, making it a convenient stop for both locals and travelers. The area is green, peaceful, and perfect for relaxing or enjoying a picnic. You can rent a mat, sit by the flowing water, and just enjoy the cool breeze from the forest.\n\nEven though it's not the largest or most dramatic waterfall in Chiang Mai, it has its own charm. In the dry season, the water flow can be quite low, but during and after the rainy season (July–November) the stream becomes stronger and more refreshing. It's a popular spot for families, couples, and solo visitors who want a quick break from the city without having to hike far. There's also a short trail leading to Wang Bua Ban viewpoint for those who want a bit of adventure.\n\nOverall, Huay Kaew Waterfall is not just a scenic natural spot-it's a peaceful retreat that's free to visit, easy to access, and well worth including in your Chiang Mai itinerary.",
