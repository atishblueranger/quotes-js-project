The clouds rolling over the lush green hills, the ocean shimmering in muted silver tones, and the soft breeze made the whole scene feel like a dream. There's something so calming and cinematic about standing up there in the rain, watching nature do its thing.\n\nThe spot itself is easy to reach and not too crowded (especially when the weather isn't sunny – lucky me!). There's a quiet energy to the place, and the windmill adds a charming touch to the landscape.\n\nIf you're in Phuket and thinking of skipping this viewpoint just because it's not all sunshine and blue skies – don't.
