But what truly caught my attention was the wall art, especially the detailed paintings depicting the life story of Sakyamuni Buddha. The artwork is beautiful and full of meaning.\n\nNo entrance fee. Proper attire is required to enter, but no worries as they provide sarongs. There's some ongoing renovation and construction, so hopefully there'll be even more to see in the future.",

If you take a guided tour, then it's always included in the tour so you might as well not do it separately.  Tour is better. The link between the blue and the white temple, the blue temple is designed but a student of the artist who designed the white temple. It's a must see.

Located in the heart of the city near the Chiang Rai Night Bazaar, this temple is easily accessible yet feels like a serene retreat from the bustling streets. Known as the original home of the Emerald Buddha (now in Bangkok), Wat Phra Kaew holds immense cultural significance, and its peaceful ambiance made our visit unforgettable.\n\nThe temple complex is beautifully maintained, with lush gardens, intricate statues, and vibrant Lanna-style buildings adorned with red and gold details. The main hall houses a replica of the Emerald Buddha, crafted with exquisite detail, and the surrounding murals depicting Buddhist tales are mesmerizing. We were particularly drawn to the Phra Yok Museum on-site, which displays rare Lanna artifacts, including jade Buddha images and ancient scriptures.\na true gem in Chiang Rai that we'd highly recommend to anyone exploring the city!",

It focuses on death a lot in the beginning but changes throughout. The level of artistry is at a great level. Everything is very manicured and beautiful.

I loved the fact that they serve drinks and a place for the customers to enjoy and soaked in the environment we are in far from the hustle and bustle  of the crowds.\n\nSince it was a very quiet day, I was fortunate to be able to spend sometime there for a production tour and met the owner whose works were displayed for his customer to enjoy.\n\nThey do custom work for small batch and big batch productions for hospitality industry yet plenty of the work was one of a kind. Their pottery products range from small tea cup to human size vases.\n\nThe service was phenomenal. They boxed my stuff with all the padding necessary and secured with industrial packing tape with handle. All ready to be checked in. It was so convenient.",

His paintings exude strong strokes, and seeing paintings was worth the trip alone. Original paintings can be seen in the galleries next to the parking lot. The main structure on the museum grounds contains prints. One thing that stands out is the artist's prolific collection of things. Some interesting buildings on the grounds, one of which is reminiscent of a traditional house in Sulawesi (also some statues that looked Balinese in origin). Everything is visually engaging, definitely not a typical Thai attraction. There are artisans in the back building wood working, which was great to see as well.\n\nOne staff said before COVID the museum would receive two to three thousand guests per day, but now visitors number around 500 per day. There are plenty of tourists here but it doesn't feel overcrowded. Well worth the visit.",

Hidden amid Chiang Rai's tranquil landscape, this café feels like stepping into a scene from Avatar, complete with indoor waterfalls, misty air, and towering, nature-inspired structures that make you feel like you've been transported to another world.\n\nThe interior is stunning-lush greenery, water features, and fantasy-like architecture create a rainforest-meets-fairy-tale setting. It's easily one of the most photogenic spots in Chiang Rai, perfect for those looking to blend nature, fantasy, and a great photo op.\n\nService-hot dishes can take 30 to 45 minutes to arrive. However, drinks and desserts come out quickly, making it easy to settle in and enjoy the surroundings.\n\nThe chocolate cake, in particular, stands out: rich, spongy, and almost pudding-like in texture. It's indulgent and comforting-absolutely worth trying if you have a sweet tooth like me.\n\nWhether you're looking to relax, explore, or snap some standout photos, it's a magical stop that adds something unique to any Chiang Rai itinerary.",
