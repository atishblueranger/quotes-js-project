On the top floor, another spacious food court provides more dining choices, from local favorites to international options.\n\nDuring my visit, the atmosphere was lively with special promotional events. A beautiful and energetic lady was promoting Nissan cars non-stop on the microphone, drawing a crowd with her enthusiasm. Right after the entrance, another young woman was singing a beautiful song with a warm smile, creating such a welcoming and pleasant vibe - both of them truly deserve appreciation for their talent and effort.\n\nIn terms of shopping, the mall features well-known brands such as H&M, Uniqlo, Levi's, Bata, and many more, making it a convenient spot for both fashion and lifestyle needs. The layout is clean and easy to navigate, and the air-conditioning offers a comfortable escape from Chiang Mai's heat. Overall, Central Chiangmai is an excellent place to shop, eat, relax, and enjoy some unexpected live entertainment.",

            "text": "Central Chiang Mai is a nice place to shop. It's like a Thai street market that meets a Western mall. They've got everything from big-name international stores to cute little Thai shops, so you're bound to find something you like. The mall itself is super clean and easy to walk around, which is a big plus. Honestly, the food here is the real star. You can grab anything you're in the mood for, whether it's fancy international stuff or some tasty Thai food. There are tons of places to eat, from quick bites to sit-down restaurants – something for every budget, too.\nThe only thing is, apart from the food, some of the other stores can be pricey. Still, overall, Central Chiang Mai is a top-notch spot to hang out for an afternoon or evening. You can shop, eat, and have a good time all in one.",

One Nimman is a shopping centre and outdoor plaza handily located just across the road from Maya Lifestyle Shopping Centre and Think Park – it is easy to find, just look for the Italian bell tower!. We like that One Nimman is a little different from other Chiang Mai shopping centres – it has cobbled streets, a piazza plus a beautiful Italian style street (known as One Street) of chic cofffee shops and fashion stores – it actually feels kinda like the Bellagio shopping centre in Las Vegas (like kinda fake but still quite cool).",

Just my luck, as soon as the tickets printed it out, it went straight under the machine and had to find something long to fetch it back. Apparently it has happened to other customers as we found other movie tickets from a few days ago.\n\nThe theatre was huge. The seats are cushioned and they recline however you can not raise your feet up. They also offered first class seats for more. We paid 420b for 2 for standard seats. There was about 27 minutes of commercials before the movie started. It was subtitled in Thai.\n\nWe also purchased an extra large cheese flavored popcorn for 150b. It was good but very salty and we got a bottled of honey lemon tea which was too sweet.\n\nIf you wear shorts in the theater you may get a bit cold.",

While it's a decent spot for budget-friendly meals, the overall experience is a mixed bag-good for quick bites but lacking in some areas that prevent it from being a standout destination.\n\nOne of the market's biggest strengths is its diverse food selection. You'll find classic Thai street food like pad Thai, som tam (spicy papaya salad), grilled meats, and noodle soups, alongside Western options such as burgers, sandwiches, and pizza. The prices are very reasonable, making it a great place for travelers on a budget.\n\nAnusran Market is a typical local market-lively, chaotic, and not the most comfortable for a relaxed meal. The seating areas are basic, often cramped, and not always clean. If you're looking for a quiet dining experience, this isn't the place.\n\nThe affordability of Anusran Market is its biggest selling point. You can easily get a filling meal for under 100 THB ($3), which is great for backpackers or those looking to save money. However, the low prices sometimes reflect in the quality-portions can be small, and ingredients aren't always the freshest.\n\nAnusran Market is a solid option if you're looking for cheap, varied food in Chiang Mai. It's convenient, especially if you're staying nearby, and offers enough choices to satisfy different tastes. However, it doesn't stand out in terms of food quality, ambiance, or cleanliness compared to other markets like Warorot or the North Gate Jazz Co-op area.\n\n*Pros:*\n✔ Affordable prices\n✔ Wide variety of Thai and Western food\n✔ Authentic local market experience\n\n*Cons:*\n✖ Inconsistent food quality\n✖ Crowded and noisy\n✖ Hygiene could be improved\n\nIf you're in the area and want a quick, cheap meal, Anusran Market is worth a stop. But if you're looking for the best street food in Chiang Mai, there are better options elsewhere.",

The scenery around the airport is lovely - surrounded by greenery and giving a warm first impression of northern Thailand. The atmosphere was calm and relaxed, quite a contrast to the busy terminals in Bangkok.\n\nWhat really stood out was the hospitality of the airport staff. Everyone I interacted with was friendly, polite, and ready to assist, which made the arrival experience very comfortable.\n\nBaggage claim was quick, signs were clear, and it didn't take long to reach the exit. While the airport isn't huge, it's clean, well-managed, and has a few shops and cafes for quick refreshments.\n\nOverall, Chiang Mai Airport gave me a positive and peaceful welcome to the city - a great start to my visit!",

Its biggest advantage is location-just a short drive from the city center-making it one of the most accessible airports in the country. Arrivals and immigration are usually smooth and efficient, with friendly staff who maintain a clean and organized environment. The airport is compact, easy to navigate, and generally hassle-free compared to much larger airports.\n\nHowever, with passenger numbers increasing every year, the airport is beginning to feel outdated. During peak times, long queues can form at check-in and security, and seating space becomes limited. Dining and shopping options inside the terminal are quite basic, with limited variety and higher-than-average prices. The single runway also restricts capacity, raising concerns about handling larger aircraft and more frequent flights as tourism grows.\n\nFor the future, it would be wonderful to see upgrades that match the city's growing reputation. Expanding the terminal, improving facilities, and adding more comfortable lounges and food choices would enhance the passenger experience. With its beautiful setting surrounded by green hills, the airport could also take inspiration from Zurich Airport, blending modern infrastructure with natural landscaping to create a more refreshing, world-class gateway to Chiang Mai.",

The quality of the clothes and food there is really quite cheap. The clothes and shoes, in particular, are very suitable for students' styles, but the material quality is not very good. The whole night market is quite large.\n\nAs a tourist, I think it's okay to visit if you have time, but don't expect to find good quality clothes. If you're short on time, there's no need to make a special trip to visit.",

The inside is showing its age a bit, but the good thing about this mall is that its located equidistance from both Niman Road and the north-western edge of the Old City – so walking distance if you are staying around here. International fashion stores are a bit limited, but the food court never disappoints and there is also some bowling and beers available on the top floor, good for rainy days or an afternoon out of the heat.",

Here you will find banks with an exchange bureau, four floors of Central department store, boutiques, shoe shops, endless mobile phone vendors, a sport store, computer emporium, and well-known names like Swensons, Watsons, Boots, Sizzler and a Mac izone. A bowling alley and movie house are on the upper levels and there is a kids’ play area to the rear of the second floor.",

In fact it’s the place to go if you need to get your iPhone fixed in Chiang Mai.",
