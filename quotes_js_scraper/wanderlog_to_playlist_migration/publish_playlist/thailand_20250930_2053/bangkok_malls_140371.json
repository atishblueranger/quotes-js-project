There are plenty of dining options, ranging from street-style Thai food to international cuisines, so there's something for everyone.\n\nThe riverside location adds to the charm – the views are stunning, especially in the evening. Everything is well-organized, and the overall vibe of the mall makes it perfect for shopping, dining, or just exploring.\n\nDefinitely a must-visit in Bangkok, whether you're into shopping, food, or simply looking to enjoy a world-class mall experience.",

Step outside (under the covered section) and you'll find an impressive range of restaurants and cafés with convenient parking and well-organized taxi pick-up points.\nOne suggestion to the owner: offer a “Mega Shopper Passport” available right at the information desks. With just a passport scan, shoppers could receive same-day discounts, VAT refund guidance, and dining vouchers. No apps required. It would make Mega Bangna not just a mall, but a must-stop experience for foreign shoppers.",

You'll find plenty of massage chairs and beauty shops-especially manicures-lining the walkways, ready to welcome walk-in customers.\n\nThe atmosphere is energetic and tourist-heavy, with vendors eager to make a sale. Some shopkeepers can be a bit pushy, especially with tourists, but it's all part of the hustle-and-bustle charm. Despite the crowds, the mall is fairly clean and well-maintained, and the variety of goods makes it easy to spend hours browsing and buying.\n\nThere's also a decent selection of food options and arcade-style games for families or casual hangouts.

            "text": "One of my favourite shopping malls in Bangkok. It's very huge, super clean (like the majority of malls) and with a vast majority of shops and restaurants. Though it's not located in downtown Bangkok, it's still very easy to reach using BTS. Central Ladprao has a direct connection from the BTS station \"Ha Yaek Lat Phrao\".\n\nWe liked the mall as there weren't many tourists around. Lots of locals enjoying their time there, browsing around and having good food. At the lowest floor, there are nice little food stalls and a supermarket. Then there are also lots of clothing stores and lots of places where you get glasses. On the top floor, there's a huge cinema as well.\n\nYou can surely spend a lot of time in Central Ladprao, but I'd recommend you to combine a visit to this mall with a visit to Union Mall as well. It's closed by and can be reached from the BTS station by Skywalk. Union Mall has a totally different vibe, more rustic and definitely cheaper for shopping ;)",

            "text": "It is the most discriminated, rude and arrogant  team of staff I have ever seen in Bangkok or anywhere else. Staff and scalper are smuggling products together, and the store manager was very rude to tourist, deliberately lie and even yell to tourist customer so he can sell store products to scalpers. I was passing by Popmart and saw boxes of stock arriving, so I asked what they are and if they can be purchased by walk in. The store manager look at me up and down, then said they are Labubu, u wanna buy u queue. I said ok, where is the queue, he said, outside, I went outside, asked the guard, he pointed the queue to me. Not too many people, acceptable, so I went back of the queue. After about less than half an hour, queue start to move, a staff start to chat with people in the queue one by one and give them a card. When it's my turn, he said in Thai, of course I don't understand, so I start to ask if he speak English, then he said, we are out of stock today. I was like, ok, then I left. After dinner when I pass by again, I saw him still giving out cards, I walk towards him and ask why the queue back again, is it because there are more delivery? he said no, then I said to him I was there about 2 hours ago, u said the card is finished, why u giving out them now? and when I ask you, why you say no again? He said, I don't recall see u before, today it's over, you may not stand here,while he was saying this to me, another person came, they speak in Thai and he gave him a card. Till that point, I said to him, r u doing this because I am tourist? He said he doesn't cares. You can speak to store manager. Then a scalper passing by with 2 carts of products. I was really upset and went up to the store manager, he yielded at me loudly, saying I don't see you before and I don't have cards now. Whatever u say is not going to change that. Then a scalper next to us saying to me I can sell to you with double the price. The store manager did not say anything and just left. The whole thing became really ridiculous, It's not something must have, so I left, on my way out, another staff continue to give out cards to Thai people, not sure if they are customer or not, and some other tourist who speak English and Chinese going toward the store manager and try to ask how to queue, and the answer was, we finished today. Along the corridor, scalper are try to sell me a Labubu with double or triple price. I am ok with not able to buy when they out of stock, but in this case, I can't not buy because I was discriminated, as I am not Thai. As a county and city that is heavily relay on tourism, a famous corporate with multiple real-estate and shopping malls, This is very disappointing yet even disgusting.",

As we are a Muslim couple, unfortunately, we only had vegetarian food as none of the food was halal. We still  really enjoyed the fruits and deserts. Best thing was the prices, which were very budget-friendly.\n\nBut we enjoyed the food festival on the ground floor. There they had some halal stalls.",

Before heading to our Chao Phraya Dinner Cruise Night 🚢🌃, we decided to explore Terminal 21, and honestly, it turned out to be one of the best shopping malls I've ever visited in my lifetime 🏙️💖.\n\nThe moment we stepped inside, it felt like stepping into a whole new world 🌏. This place is massive – around 5 to 6 floors plus the ground floor 🏢 – each level beautifully themed and designed with so much attention to detail ✨🎨. The decorations are absolutely stunning 🎉💡, giving a fresh, vibrant, and luxurious vibe all around.\n\nEverywhere you look, there are famous clothing brands 👗👟, luxury boutiques 💎👜, and an amazing variety of food options 🍣🍔🍕. From Starbucks ☕ to KFC 🍗, and plenty of unique local and international food stalls, there's something for everyone to enjoy.\n\nWe spent our time walking through each floor 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️, admiring the creative designs, taking photos 📸, and soaking up the lively atmosphere 💃🕺. It's the kind of place where you can easily lose track of time because there's just so much to see and explore ⏳❤️.\n\nBefore our dinner cruise, this mall visit was already a highlight of the day 🌟, and it perfectly set the mood for the rest of the evening 🌙✨. Terminal 21 is a WOW factor shopping destination – a mix of style, luxury, and fun all under one roof 🛍️🏆.\n\nIf you're in Bangkok, I highly recommend adding this to your must-visit list ✅ – you won't regret it!\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ – Absolute perfection!",

The girls at the information desk are super helpful, speak good english and very knowledgeable about the location of every single store. This time of year comes with a beautiful christmas tree and accompanying holiday music to get you in the right mood. And when I was leaving today with several heavy grocery bags and got to the escalator that takes you to the taxis a male employer (security guard?) without hesitation ran over to help carry the bags for me and another was waiting outside and opened the car door.

It's one of the more affordable malls in Bangkok and has a much more local feel as there are not a lot of Westerners. Despite this, it has a nice Starbucks, a Krispy Kreme, A McDonald's and other western themed menus. The majority of restaurants are Thai, Korean and Japanese themed.\n\nAlthough a ways out of the center of city, I'd highly recommend shopping here for luggage accessories, clothing and local food compared to any other mall I've been to in Bangkok. That includes Central World, Terminal 21, Icon Siam and Paragon among others.\n\nThe staff is very friendly throughout the mall as well!",

One of the coolest places to chill, it lets you explore diverse art collections-from contemporary galleries to antique pianos and Persian carpets-while enjoying the convenience of boat access from the Chao Phraya River. Located directly opposite Icon Siam, it provides a scenic and relaxing arrival with stunning river and cityscape views as your backdrop.\n\nBeyond its galleries, River City Bangkok also hosts Heavenly Voice Studio and a dedicated Harp Studio, making it a hub for musicians and music lovers. When hunger or caffeine cravings strike, you'll find several restaurants and cafés on-site-including a Starbucks-so you can refuel without leaving the premises.\n\nThroughout the year, River City Bangkok hosts a wide variety of exhibitions-from contemporary and modern art to cultural showcases-keeping the space dynamic and exciting with something new to discover every visit. I had the opportunity to perform in the Antique Piano and Persian Carpets exhibition, which was a memorable experience surrounded by rare instruments and stunning decor.\n\nFor those driving in, River City Bangkok offers a 24‑hour car park with security guards, accessed via Charoenkrung 24 and 30. The facility accommodates up to 500 cars and provides direct entry to all floors of the complex, plus ample motorcycle parking.\n\nOne thing that stands out is the background music played throughout the venue. River City Bangkok might be the only place I've ever been to that plays classical music-like Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2, Grieg's Piano Concerto in A minor, Mozart's Clarinet Concerto, or Chopin's Piano Concerto-as ambient music, adding a refined and artistic touch to the entire atmosphere.\n\nWhether you're an art enthusiast, a musician, or simply looking to unwind, River City Bangkok delivers a seamless blend of culture, convenience, and comfort.",

You will get all the trendy outfits here, but I would not say that the price is very cheap. It is just that you had a good collection at a good price here. It is at a very accessible area and you can just walk around and shop. There are also options to eat so that you don't get tired in between your shopping. Just remember you can Bargain so be ready to negotiate for your shopkeepers",

From casual, semi-casual, and formal clothing to second-quality branded shoes, accessories, handcrafted items, and food stalls-you'll find it all here at very reasonable prices.\n\nThe place is massive, spread across more than 7 floors. I visited for 3 days in a row and still couldn't cover the entire mall-it's never enough for crazy shoppers! The market is always buzzing, as many buyers come for wholesale purchases to resell stock.\n\nWhile prices are fair, bargaining works better if you're buying in bulk. For single items, sellers usually don't drop their prices much. Overall, a vibrant, bustling shopping paradise that can easily take up more than just one visit.",

The mall is spread across multiple floors, each filled with countless shops offering an incredible variety of clothing, accessories, souvenirs, and more making it a true paradise for shoppers. What I really appreciated was the convenience of having everything under one roof. From shopping to food courts with plenty of dining options, and even facilities like money exchange counters, it's designed to make the experience easy and enjoyable for tourists. If you get tired, there are places to sit and relax before continuing your shopping journey.

I think every major shopping centres in Bangkok have their own unique style and identity, I felt like Emsphere was for us not because it was fairly new ish (I think opened in 2023) but it's well designed, very clean and bright using natural lights well and not feeling to cramped while exploring and shopping, the art and creativity is what I enjoyed the most about EmSphere, and you can randomly buy a car (micro dealership). It felt like prestige on a budget but this place you can buy anything, the quality of items are much higher than most SC but if you want food there's plenty to choose from, we had of the best coffees in BKK here called Beans, being from Australia it was hard to find great warm latte and cappuccino this is the place to grab it from for sure, felt like home. What else can I say, even the lifts and elevators were beautifully designed and one of cleanliness SC in Bangkok by a mile! Colourful, fun with elegant vibes…",

From shopping to dining to unique design elements, it's a place where you can easily spend hours exploring. We mainly went for the food and absolutely loved V-Street, their vegan street food concept. The variety, flavor, and creativity of the dishes were fantastic, making it a real highlight for anyone who enjoys plant-based food.\n\nThe interior and design of EmSphere is wild yet thoughtfully done - creative, colorful, and definitely memorable. It feels modern and stylish but still welcoming, with something for everyone whether you want to shop, relax, or eat.\n\nTips for visitors: Come hungry and give V-Street a try if you enjoy vegan or vegetarian food, but there are countless other food options too. Go during off-peak hours if you want to avoid the biggest crowds and take time to wander - every corner has something to catch your eye.\n\nOverall, EmSphere is not just a mall, but an experience. Perfect for foodies, shoppers, or anyone curious to see Bangkok's newest and trendiest spot. Highly recommended!",

I'd recommend to combine Union Mall with a visit to Central Ladprao. You can easily move between those two malls by a BTS Skywalk.",

I actually preferred shopping here over Platinum Mall since it offers similar affordable clothing but with a better mix and style.

The layout is spacious and beautifully designed, making it easy and enjoyable to stroll around even on a warm day. The open-air concept is refreshing, and there's plenty of shaded seating and rest areas if you need a break.\n\nThe selection of brands is impressive – from international favorites like Coach, Nike, Adidas, Polo Ralph Lauren, Michael Kors, and Kate Spade, to local Thai designer labels, all offering genuine discounts. The deals are real, and many stores offer additional promotions on top of the outlet prices.\n\nI also appreciated how clean and well-maintained the entire complex is. The staff are helpful and polite, and there are plenty of signs and maps to help you navigate. There's a good mix of food options too, from cafes and snack stalls to more filling Thai and Asian meals – perfect for a shopping break.\n\nTransportation is convenient, with shuttle buses and ample parking available. It's an easy day trip from central Bangkok, and definitely worth the visit if you love branded goods at a great value.\n\nHighly recommended for locals and tourists alike – you won't leave empty-handed!",

Shoe options are solid, but clothing choices felt limited, especially for families looking for variety. The food court is minimal, and restaurant options overall are quite restricted-something to keep in mind if you're planning a longer visit.\n\nDespite the thoughtful design, the outlet didn't feel busy. It's a great concept, but the experience doesn't quite match the potential. Worth a visit if you're hunting specific brands, but not ideal for a relaxed family outing or full-day shopping trip.",
