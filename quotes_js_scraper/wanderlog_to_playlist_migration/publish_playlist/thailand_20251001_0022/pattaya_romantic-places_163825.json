The craftsmanship and detail are truly impressive, and it feels very unique compared to other temples in the region.\n\nHowever, the ticket price is insanely high, especially for Thailand. Also, you're required to join a guided tour to enter, which honestly wasn't great. Our guide seemed to just make things up or tell random stories that weren't very engaging. We ended up walking away from the group - which I highly recommend. Otherwise, you won't be able to take proper photos, since the group moves quickly and keeps you in one area.\n\nOfficially, after an hour with the guide, you're allowed to explore on your own and take pictures, but by then, you're already tired and not in the mood. So just quietly disconnect earlier if you want to enjoy it at your own pace.\n\nOverall, the temple is incredible and definitely worth seeing once - just be prepared for the high price and the tour system.",

The place is not just beautiful but also deeply meaningful, with its philosophy and the Seven Truths of Life that can truly change how we see the world and make it a better place. The experience there was marvellous and very peaceful. It is also a fantastic spot for photography, with every corner offering something unique. I would highly recommend everyone to visit this place at least once in their life.",

            "text": "Tiffany's Show Pattaya is easily the FINEST masterpiece of cabaret in Thailand, and I say this after watching many.\n\nThe ticket price is incredibly reasonable considering the sheer production value poured into this show. The level of talent, beauty, and professionalism from all the performers is stunning-truly incomparable. If you want to experience transvestite cabaret as an art form, this is the one to see.\n\nFrom Lady Gaga to Beyoncé, from high-tech staging to acrobatics, the performance is multilayered and dynamic. Unlike other cabarets that lean into slapstick or even degrading humor, Tiffany's is designed to awe and inspire. They even incorporate masculine energy into the mix, making it a refreshing and sophisticated experience.\n\nA special mention to their inclusivity-not only are the performers incredible, but even the ticket booth staff and ushers are trans professionals. The usher, in particular, had eagle eyes for spotting people sneaking recordings, which was much needed since so many ignored the “NO RECORDING” rule displayed on screens.\n\nNone of the performers were pushy about photo sessions either. I brought my sister here for her birthday since she had always wanted to see the show. She took a photo with one of the performers, and she was so elegant, cheerful, and down-to-earth person.\n\nA truly amazing experience that I would recommend to everyone!",

Despite the rush, we were lucky enough to get a table without too much waiting, but I would definitely recommend pre-booking a table in advance if you want a smoother experience.\n\nThe food and drinks were very good, served fresh, and the staff managed everything well considering the crowd. What really stood out was the view-it's absolutely breathtaking, especially during sunset, and worth the visit on its own.\n\nOverall, Sky Gallery is a great place to enjoy a meal with friends or family, but keep in mind that it gets very crowded.

This is a place to visit for creativity, illusion, and a bit of fun photography, this is a must-visit if you anyone mentioned above.\n\nThe museum is divided into themed zones, from ancient ruins and underwater worlds to fantasy landscapes and optical illusions. Each section is filled with meticulously painted artworks that come alive through clever 3D / AR . The key here is interaction: visitors are encouraged to pose, act, and become part of the art, which makes it especially engaging for families, couples, and even solo travelers.\n\nStaff members are friendly and available to help with photo angles at the entrance. There are guides on the floor showing where to stand for the perfect shot, which is a helpful touch.\n\nI appreciated how well-maintained the facility was. Cleanliness and lighting were top-notch, and crowd control was decent, even on a weekend afternoon. You'll easily spend  2 hours here, especially if you're aiming to capture fun memories.\n\nOverall, Art in Paradise is more than a museum. Whether you're looking for a playful outing or Instagram-worthy photos, this spot delivers a unique blend of art and entertainment. Definitely worth the entrance fee.",

It was fun, and we made a lot of great videos.\n\nThe videos made through the app look cool. For the photos, I used standard camera, as photoes through the app were a bit blurred (though regular camera doesn't have 3d AR effects).\n\nIf you make photos with lion cubs, make sure to ask staff to use a standard camera on your phone and not the app. Otherwise, the photos will be blurred.\n\nThe kids were happy and we all had a lot of fun.",

The large pieces of chicken are cooked to perfection in a rich, flavorful gravy. The taste is incredible-well-balanced and not overly sweet like many others. It's on the spicier side for a Massaman, which is a big plus for me.\n\nI thought I had already found the best Massaman in Pattaya, but I might have to reconsider. Plus, they offer so many other curries and dishes-I can't wait to try more. Absolutely amazing. Highly recommended!",

Many of the food options here were completely new to me, food I haven't come across in the more touristy night markets.

It felt very genuine and gave me a glimpse into everyday Thai life beyond the usual tourist trail.",

Perfect location.\n\nI would definitely visit again.\n\nBut the kitchen does not make your food at the same time as the people at your table. Usually, I would eat my food before or after my family. Sometimes up to 15 mins apart. They should be able to time it better so families can eat together at the same time. But this is a problem all over Thailand, not just here.\n\nAnd the staff (at breakfast, lunch, and dinner) are strict about where you can sit. We could rarely choose our own table and were often moved around, and they said we could not sit here or there.\n\nAnd I'd suggest giving traditional paper menus to customers, not electronic tablets. There aren't enough tablets, so you have to wait for another table to finish ordering before you can get the menu. Also, it's difficult to see the menu using a tablet. After a week here, I still missed things that are on the menu because I didn't see them.",

So I picked Ripley's Believe It or Not, Infinity Maze & Louis Tussad's Waxwork. Ripley's was awesome with lots of eye openers, which bewildered all of us.. then we  march over to Infinity Maze, which is really.. REALLY an adventure for the seniors.. unfortunately, they disallowed videos or photos inside the Maze..  so basically how it works is that you have to wear their shoes protector to keep the place clean. Then you enter a walkway and then go into the 1st room. Everything looks identical..  and you can't see the exit door. Hence, with the gloves they provided you, you have to FIND YOUR WAY OUT!! 😆 Hahaha.. I love this.. my parents went into panic mood, lol!! They walked back to the entrance where we came in, and I asked them to be patient and spend time looking for the way to the next place. It was a fun game that instantly let everyone feel so united to look for the door.. there are multiple rooms that we need to pass through before we could exit, but each room holds a mystery and gives us different experiences. My advice is, please, please don't get panic, enjoy the claustrophobic feeling, and laugh at yourselves when you recall back the experience. My parents were so relieved when we finally walked back to the main entrance area.. I could just laugh non stop.. 🙃 Last was the Waxwork, and only some statues at the exterior look similar to the real person. Other than that, the rest doesn't have significance resemblance, unfortunately.. we just have fun posing inside.",

This miniature park showcases over 100 meticulously crafted replicas of iconic landmarks from Thailand and across the globe, all at a 1:25 scale.\n\nThe park is divided into two main sections: Mini Siam, featuring Thai heritage sites like Wat Arun and the Temple of the Emerald Buddha, and Mini Europe, displaying international marvels such as the Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty, and Sydney Opera House. The attention to detail in each model is astounding, making it a photographer's paradise and an educational journey for visitors of all ages.\n\nI recommend visiting during the early morning or late afternoon to avoid the midday heat and to see the models beautifully illuminated. The park is well-maintained, with friendly staff and ample facilities, including rest areas and souvenir shops.\nlets-tour-bangkok.com\n\nWhether you're a history enthusiast, architecture lover, or simply looking for a unique attraction in Pattaya, Mini Siam offers a delightful and informative experience that's not to be missed.",

His attention to detail and warm demeanor made us feel genuinely welcomed and well taken care of throughout our stay.\nOne of the most impressive aspects of Peter's service was how thoughtfully he handled our halal food requirements. He ensured that every meal we were served fully respected our dietary needs, without compromising on quality or taste. His dedication to maintaining these standards made our dining experience stress-free and thoroughly enjoyable.\nPeter is undoubtedly an invaluable asset to the Pullman Pattaya team. His level of service is what encourages guests to return again and again. It's rare to encounter someone who not only meets expectations but goes above and beyond to exceed them - and Peter does exactly that.\nThank you, Peter, for making our stay so memorable. We truly appreciate your efforts and look forward to returning soon!",

The highlight was definitely Patty, the amazing waitress. She was attentive, friendly, and made sure all my needs were met with a smile.\nThe overall staff at the beach club and restaurant are fantastic. They're incredibly accommodating and go out of their way to make guests feel welcome. Whether it's a special request or just a friendly chat, they make the experience memorable.\nI've been coming back to The Beach Club every time I visit Pattaya, and I can't recommend it enough. Great food, beautiful views, and a wonderful team❤️✨\n\nAlso I loved the daily buffet breakfast - there was a great variety of delicious food to start the day. The highlight for me was the staff, especially Peter, who was incredibly helpful and kind. He makes a very good cappuccino and was always attentive, kindly asking if anyone needed coffee or anything else. His warm and friendly attitude really made the breakfast experience extra special. Highly recommend!",

The pool was lovely, they have 2 but we only used one, a walk in pool which is great if you have mobility issues. Breakfast was nice enough, not a buffet as it was low season but a menu to choose one item from and then a small buffet with bread, egg station and fruits. The whole stay was lovely. The owner is on site every day to greet you, which was nice. The only negative was being asked to write a positive review. I would have done so anyway as it's a lovely place so she didn't have to do this! Woudl I stay here again, absolutely.",

Some cultural shows also happen there, which was interesting to watch.\n\nOverall, a good experience. Worth visiting if you're in Pattaya.",

It's beautifully designed to reflect traditional Thai architecture, and walking through the wooden bridges and canals really gives you the feeling of being in old-world Thailand. There are plenty of shops and stalls selling local handicrafts, souvenirs, clothes, and delicious Thai street food.\n\nThe boat ride was a lovely touch – cruising through the canals while seeing the market from the water added an extra layer of charm. There are also live performances and cultural shows throughout the day, which are fun and colorful.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 is that some parts felt a bit commercialized, with prices higher than usual local markets. It's also quite busy during peak hours, so coming early is a good idea to avoid crowds and heat.\n\nThat said, it's still a great place to spend a few hours exploring, taking photos, and enjoying authentic Thai snacks. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Pattaya and want to experience something traditional and family-friendly. A fun and scenic destination for tourists of all ages!",

Of course the staff is awesome as in most places in Thailand but that can not make up for the world's worst seating known to humans.  Who wants to sit on the sandy ground in a dirty bean bag(chair, not chair) with a table to bang your knees on. Combine this with cranking disco dance rap music too loud to really talk at the beach Glass house seating (The Cave has a DJ). We opted for the adult chairs on the beach to watch the sunset and it was ok save the high volume music. There are some adult chairs inside near the road side.  Food was mehhh.. as expected.  You don't come here for the food.  If you come,  have a beer on the beach and watch the sunset and that's it! Be careful getting to the bathroom as it's 3 flights up. The Cave next door is the same owner and similar seating only worse. It's the same menu as well. Both places are run down and need renovation. You can Try the salted cashews. Pretty good.

We sat by the beach front, under the tree but there are few flies flying by our table so we requested if we could transfer to a different table. The staff offered that we transfer to the airconditioned dining area since the flies will still be there if we will transfer to another table outside, explaining that it's normal when sat outside.

Huge, scary, and powerful creatures ( a total hair raiser), then there are giraffes, elephants, crocodile show (a mixture of comedy and fear), tigers, and other animals and birds.\n\nA nice place to explore whether you are alone, with a partner, or with a group.

I'm just a normal traveler who usually enjoys proper, well-run zoos and wildlife parks.\nBut visiting Million Years Stone Park in Pattaya broke my heart - and I feel responsible to warn others.\nIt was a mistake.\n\nAt first, the park looks impressive. But the truth behind the shows is heartbreaking:\n•\tThe tigers looked exhausted, breathing heavily, some making sounds that honestly felt like crying. Others didn't even move, which is not how a healthy tiger should behave. Trainers kept forcing them to open their mouths for tourist photos, even though they clearly didn't want to. Their eyes could barely stay open. It's obvious they are heavily sedated - they don't even bother closing the cages because the tigers are too weak to move.\nAfter my visit, I looked at photos online and realized it's always the same two tigers used for all the tourist photos. They are chained so tightly they can't even stand or lie down properly.\n•\tThe crocodile show was disgusting and made me feel genuinely uneasy, with handlers taunting and dragging the crocodiles around for entertainment.\n•\tThe elephants were chained tightly with barely any space to move - even after hours, there was nowhere for them to roam.\n•\tThe giraffes were standing out in the blazing sun with minimal shade for the number of animals, left to suffer in the heat and likely hunger.\n\nThe enclosures only look nice on the surface.\nWhen you really look, they are far too small, poorly built, and depressing - some cages are barely bigger than a bathroom.\n\nThis isn't conservation.\nIt's pure exploitation.\nThere's nothing educational or inspiring here - just sadness dressed up for tourists.\n\nDon't let the cheap ticket fool you.\nYou're far better off spending the same money at a proper zoo or a true sanctuary where animals are respected and cared for.\n\nIn 2025, smart, compassionate travelers are choosing better.\nCompassion is the new luxury - and true travel memories should leave you proud, not uneasy.\n\nIf you are human with a heart, and you believe slavery is wrong, then you should also believe no animal deserves to live this way.\nPlease don't support this cruelty.\n\nI deeply regret going there.\nNo one should be encouraged to happily take photos with an enslaved, suffering animal.",
