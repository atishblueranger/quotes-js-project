Only wish the fish was in the middle of the pot rather than the bottom.\nThe coconut lime seafood soup was more sour unlike the usual milk coconut base.\nThe river snail with veggies was also good.

Located in the heart of Kanchanaburi, the cemetery is the final resting place for over 6,000 soldiers, primarily from the United Kingdom, Australia, and the Netherlands. The meticulously maintained grounds, with rows of neatly arranged headstones, create a solemn yet peaceful atmosphere. Each headstone bears the name, rank, and regiment of the fallen, offering visitors a personal connection to the immense human cost of war.\nThe cemetery is not just a place of remembrance but also an important historical landmark. It is located near the Death Railway Museum, which provides deeper insights into the brutal conditions faced by the POWs during the railway's construction. Visiting the site evokes a deep sense of respect and reflection, as it reminds us of the resilience and sacrifices of those who suffered. The quiet, well-kept surroundings make it a place of contemplation, where visitors can pay their respects.\nFor history enthusiasts or those wishing to honor the memory of the fallen, the Kanchanaburi War Cemetery is a must-visit destination. It stands as a powerful tribute to the past, ensuring that the stories of those who lost their lives are never forgotten.",

Perforated design of toilet's door looks great and serves its ventilating purpose  however it could give you a bit uncomfortable when doing your own business in there as people in the room can hear everything, could see your bottom half.\n\nFood was good and various, staff was great and welcoming.",

However, once you were at the hotel, you really did not have an option to leave the hotel. The included meals were not bad at all either. The only real negative was the constant presence of bugs within the room. We understood it would have been difficult to have it any other way, but it kept us from being 100% comfortable. Oh and the spa and associated services were quite affordable and an added bonus after a long day.",

The woman running the service was incredibly kind and welcoming-she even offered us free bottled water before taking us to the starting point at around 2:30 PM. We opted for the 15km route, which was perfect for a leisurely afternoon on the water.\n\nWhat sets this experience apart is the freedom it offers. There's no guide, so you can paddle at your own pace, take breaks whenever you want, and fully enjoy the scenery without any pressure. The trip took us about four hours, and we finished at around 6:30 PM. The same woman picked us up promptly and brought us back to our hotel, making the entire experience seamless and stress-free.\n\nThe price is unbeatable compared to other places. For just 600 baht, we got four hours on the water, transportation, life vests, and excellent service. If you're seeking a relaxed, affordable, and flexible kayaking adventure, this is definitely the place to go. Highly recommended!",

            "text": "'Extraordinary Experience Moments'\nCelebrating Songkran in a distinctive way by kayaking on the renowned River Kwai in Kanchanaburi was incredible. We embarked on a 15km independent kayak journey without any guides, opting to navigate it ourselves.\n\nOur adventure began when Khun Fon picked us up from our accommodation and drove us to the starting point, located 15km from the city. After a brief lesson from Khun Fon, assuring us that “we can do it,” we set off with bottles of water. We were advised to stay in the middle and avoid areas near shanties with open spaces underneath. The scenery was breathtaking, filled with fish and birds, allowing us to feel closely connected to nature. We were reminded of the beauty and tranquility that nature offers.\n\nAlthough the weather was overcast and we experienced three rain showers, these added an element of excitement to our journey.The water current was gentle, which meant we had to paddle consistently for the duration of the trip. We started at 0949 and finished just before 1300.\n\nSince there are no landmarks at the endpoint, remember to look out for four bridges along the way. The first bridge signals that you're nearing the city. The second one is the famous River Kwai bridge, followed by the third bridge just 700 meters later. The endpoint is at a Chinese temple on the left side, close to the fourth bridge. Unfortunately, we didn't have time to explore the temple as rain was approaching again.\n\nFor attire, be prepared to get wet from splashes while paddling, regardless of the weather. I wore lightweight leggings paired with shorts, a shirt, and a hat to protect myself from the sun, which also helped keep my hair dry during the rain. I brought a waterproof bag to keep my belongings safe and made sure to wear the life vest throughout the trip for safety. It's crucial to stay in the boat since the moving water could sweep you away.\n\nWe had previously kayaked 7km last year, which was a bit intimidating at first due to the river's width and being on our own. The sense of freedom and accomplishment as we paddled through the serene waters was unmatched.\n\nKhun Fon and Mook, her daughter, were wonderful hosts-enthusiastic and welcoming. They provided high-quality equipment and refreshments and were punctual with pick-ups and drop-offs. They even captured moments with photos before and after our adventure. If you're seeking a unique river experience without the constraints of heat and rain, these are the people to turn to. It's genuinely worthwhile as you create lasting memories along the way.\nThank you, Khun Fon!\n\nConquering the river turned out to be the highlight of our holiday.",
