The giant Buddha statues were really breathtaking and amazing to look at up close. There was even a 9-story pagoda you can climb where there was a Buddha relic at the top.\n\nAlthough the temple is still under construction, it is still worth stopping by just to admire the architecture and views of the rice fields.",

The temple stays on a hilltop with 360° views of green rice fields and mountains. I went in the afternoon and the light was perfect for photos. The climb up the stairs wasn't too difficult, but I'd recommend using cable car, which costs 40 baht per round. The architecture is a mix of Thai and Chinese styles, with colorful details and a peaceful vibe.\nHighly recommend this place if you're in Kanchanaburi 👍🏻👍🏻",

You can either use the safari vehicle provided or drive your own car through the park, which is a fun and unique way to get close to the animals.\n\nYou'll get to feed deer and geese, and see bears, tigers, leopards, and lions up close. The absolute highlight is the giraffes - they'll stick their heads right into your car looking for food! It's such a memorable and fun moment.\n\nThere's also a zoo area where you can see more exotic animals on foot after the drive-through safari.\n\nOverall, it's a fun half-day trip.

Our giraffe encounter at 9 AM was a fantastic experience, and the park staff was very responsive and accommodating during the booking process, making everything seamless.\n\nThe overall experience was enjoyable, with plenty of opportunities to see and interact with the animals. One thing to note is that the bathrooms could be cleaner, and there were quite a few mosquitoes, so it's good to come prepared.\n\nIf you visit early, especially during summer, you can comfortably explore the park in about two hours. Arriving in the morning also means a cooler and more pleasant experience. Overall, it's a great place to visit, and we'd recommend it to animal lovers!",

The tour guide spoke English very well, he was entertaining and sarcastic overall lots of banter and laughs. It took us 3 hours to get there, we then ate lunch and began the activities 1.5 hours after arrival. I will say all of the activities were very repetitive for the elephants with all of the groups coming in however the elephants knew the routine and I did not see any of the tour guides or elephant keepers be forceful or doing wrong by animals. There was lots of dogs at every activity spot. The only thing I was concerned about  / did not like to see was there is a bull (I think?) which appeared to be tied to a tree.. overall it was a good experience",

Employees play various roles in this community and dress according to the role they play. Visitors are invited to also dress in period clothing which can be rented on site for a small fee. There is a modest admission charge but each visitor receives the equivalent value in coins that can be used to interact with food vendors and shop keepers to purchase things. The coins actually encourage a deeper participation and learning experience as you see how the various classes of vendors dressed, lived, and worked. Foods are prepared as they were in the period. The recreation of a village was much more interesting than I expected. This is worth visiting. Plan at least 2 hours.",
