If you're a germaphobe bring hand sanitizer.\n\nYou can haggle on prices here so give them your best offer before you settle on souvenir prices but don't cheat them.

We checked a few places before we decided where to eat. For example we told one guy to measure two of the big tiger prawns and they we half a kg on his scale. Went to another picked two smaller tiger prawns and it showed 600kg on his scale.... so yeah watch out. We've chosen yummy yummy and it was very yummy :)) fried rice with vegetables, one octopus skewer and two huge tiger prawns with garlic butter sauce, it was cooked to perfection and just enough for two people. And all together our dinner was half as cheap if went to a restaurant so didn't regret it and will go back again. 4 stars only because some of them are cheating. 5 stars for food",

Nothing like the food courts in MBK, CentralWorld, Terminal 21 etc.  I found the food to be quite average tasting here and portion size small (majority of items around the 150bht price range). I'd definitely recommend venturing out of Jungceylon mall to eat. Many different restaurants along the main strip that would be better value and quality.
