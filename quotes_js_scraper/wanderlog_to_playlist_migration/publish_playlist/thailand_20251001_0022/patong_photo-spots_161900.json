Today, we came to celebrate Father's Day with family and friends, and once again, Tree Monkey didn't disappoint.\n\nWe shared a spread of flavorful, beautifully prepared dishes. Some must-tries include the Steamed White Snapper in Chili Lime Sauce, the restaurant's famous Deep-Fried Pork Knuckle, Crispy Fish Salad, Roasted Spicy Pork Ribs, and for my son - a delicious Beef Bolognese.\n\nIf you're a coffee lover, don't miss their Espresso Coconut or the Coconut Smoothie Coffee - a refreshing and unique twist on your usual caffeine fix!\n\nWe chose to dine outdoors, enjoying a relaxing lunch with scenic views and live music from a talented Filipino acoustic duo that added the perfect touch to the atmosphere.\n\nA special mention to Mr. MJ, our server - he was attentive, always smiling, and very knowledgeable about the restaurant and the activities inside Hanuman World. His warm service made our experience even better.\n\nQuick tip: If you're a walk-in guest, make sure to register upon arrival. They do get a lot of bookings and reservations, but the process is super quick - just scan a QR code, fill in your details, and you're good to go!\n\nThis place is highly recommended for family gatherings, celebrations, or even just a chill hangout spot with great views and amazing food. We'll definitely be back again!",

They go above and beyond and take good care of you. We had a wonderful meal in a unique setting. There was even live music, which wasn't expected on a weekday. You get a big 10!",

Despite the restaurant being quite busy, it's spacious enough that I was able to get a table without a reservation.\n\nThe only downside was the ongoing maintenance work, which made the atmosphere a bit noisy. Also, the outdoor seating could really benefit from more shade or umbrellas to block the sun during the day.\n\nOverall, it's a beautiful place with great food and a unique jungle vibe – definitely worth a visit!",

Towards the back of the market are souvenir/clothing stalls that offer a solid selection of clothes/trinkets that are good quality and priced fairly. Overall a great spot to grab a bite and get some souvenirs.\nDefinitely get the massive water coconut and mango sticky rice, that alone is worth the trip.",

What makes it unique is that you can be in a place with both amazing views, one with the jungle-covered hills and the other one with clear water and granite rocks on the Andaman Sea. One of the best characteristics about this beach is that as there is no overnight accommodation nearby, it is the perfect spot for getting in touch with nature and really enjoying the peaceful views and the beauty of marine life and its underwater kingdom.",

Freedom beach offers a throwback to the way Thailand was before tourism turned its enchanting shores into a tourist hot spot—-dotted with quiet beaches, immaculate sand, and an atmosphere of utter relaxation.",

It is immersed in the wild, tropical green of the jungle, it is very beautiful and interesting, its territory is divided into several areas by natural rock formations. There are few people and a lot of space.\n\nThe wide shoreline, hidden sunbeds and umbrellas, make this beautiful beach wild. Practically nothing has been changed here by human hands!\n\nThe flora is amazing: a large number of: different trees, massive shrubs, palm trees, beautiful stones and everything else.\n\nThe sand here is very soft, light in color. Turquoise, clear sea. Good depth and there are no low tides (watch the tides in the appendix)! Here is a coral reef, which is worth exploring, armed with a mask, snorkel and flippers.\n\nFull information with video and easy navigation - in the app 👉 PHUKETON",

No noisy water sports or banana boats, which is a huge plus if you're here to relax.\nBut fair warning: the hike up and down is no joke! It's steep and a bit rough, so definitely not for the faint-hearted. That said, if you're into adventure and don't mind breaking a sweat to get to paradise, it's 100% worth it. Feels like a hidden gem for beach lovers who enjoy a bit of a challenge.",

            "text": "This place was incredible but it is quite the journey to get to and from. We took a grab and I was quite nervous when we were driving in due to the steep, windy roads. They dropped us off at a booth that makes you pay 100 baht per person. After reading, they make you pay this for walking through their land to get to the beach. After walking about 10 minutes down some dirt path with stairs, we finally made it to some rocks that we had to climb down to get to the beach. Once there, we quickly realized why it was called freedom beach. There is weed everywhere, everyone is just chillin on towels and enjoying life. The vibes here are spot on and 100% worth the journey for couples and single people (not families). The journey back up seemed like it would be easier since there are stairs but the stairs were a joke because they led you to a pickup truck that costs 100 baht per person. The alternative was to climb up a mountain basically so my recommendation is to bring water and sneakers so you can get to and from the beach easily and safely. Also the grabs picking you up won't come all the way up to pick you up so that was quite a journey to navigate.",
