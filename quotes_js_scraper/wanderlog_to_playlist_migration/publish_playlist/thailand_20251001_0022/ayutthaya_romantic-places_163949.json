At 37 meters long, this statue is not only massive but also beautifully detailed. The peaceful expression on the Buddha's face, paired with the serene surroundings of the temple, creates a calming atmosphere that allows you to take in the spiritual significance of the place.\n\nWhat I found particularly interesting was how the reclining Buddha symbolizes the Buddha's final moments before attaining Nirvana, a powerful representation of peace and enlightenment. The temple is well-maintained, and the staff and monks are incredibly welcoming, making the visit even more memorable. Whether you're here for spiritual reasons or to admire the incredible craftsmanship, Phra Buddha Sai Yat is a must-see when visiting Ayutthaya.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking to explore the cultural and spiritual history of Thailand!",

Lovely pool particularly for watching the sunset - though absolutely freezing! Good gym too. Good breakfast. The immediate area around the hotel has nothing to offer that I could see, but I didn't spend much time in the hotel so I could've missed something. Recommended.",
