Be sure to use high UV protection creams when sunbathing here.\n\nThe sand here is soft, light gray in color. The entrance to the sea is medium deep. The water is clear, blue-green color! The wind in the high season is not strong.\n\nThe bulk of vacationing tourists are concentrated at the hotels adjacent to the beach.\n\nFull information with video and easy navigation - in the app 👉 PHUKETON",

The pool is lovely. There is another pool and spa at the beach but it was always full of kids. You can find your own quiet spot as it is not busy here… although my husband says as soon as I review things I wreck them, as then people go! The food is also fantastic and you really should lose weight before you come! We got a great package with food included. The band are lovely and some tourists that come often play along or have a sing. Everyone is so sweet… except the tourists! They seem so unhappy but how could you be here? I highly recommend Cape Panwa Hotel… and up the road so many great massages and stop in at the Sunset View bar for a beer and the view.",

Snorkeling around the northern headland and rocky promontory was fantastic, vibrant corals and fish abound, with gear rentals at 100 THB. Kayaking to Koh Man, a nearby island, was a highlight for just 100-150 THB/hour.\n\nThe beach's laid-back vibe, framed by lush hills, is ideal for families and couples. Two small restaurants across the road, like Royros, serve tasty Thai dishes (200 THB) and refreshing coconut drinks.\n\nHowever, litter in the water was noticeable, and low tide exposes rocks, making swimming tricky. No sunbeds or umbrellas keep it unspoiled, but bring a towel for shade under trees. Parking is limited, so arrive early.\n\nDespite minor drawbacks, Yanui's charm and proximity to stunning viewpoints make it a must-visit for a peaceful Phuket beach day.",

The rooms were immaculate, great AC, the food from room service was fabulous, and the staff was amazing. We stayed in a villa with a private pool, which we loved. You can walk the grounds or simply call for a golf cart to take you around the resort; some of the areas are pretty steep. Tommy helped us book excursions and gave us ideas of what to do and where to eat while in Thailand. The breakfast buffet was really good, the bar drinks were good as well. The location was great. We booked several excursions, and we were always the first ones picked up for the tours because our location was more central, I think. The villa had 2 sides. One side with the living room, bathroom, and patio area. The other side is with the bedroom and bathroom and the shower (inside and oustide). Both sides have AC and tvs and access to the pool. Zero complaints, highly recommend.\n*the food in the pictures are all from room service (different days). I didn't post pictures of local food spots because this is a review for the resort.",

A fun off-road adventure that only adds to the experience-unless, of course, you believe every paradise should come with a four-lane highway.\n\nNow, let's clear up some misunderstandings: Nui Beach, like all beaches in Thailand, is part of the kingdom's natural beauty and is open to everyone. You're free to enjoy the sand and sea at no cost. However, the sunbeds, bar, and other facilities are privately maintained, and naturally, access to these comforts comes with a fee-just as you'd expect anywhere that provides quality service in a beautiful setting.\n\nSome visitors seem surprised that a remote beach club isn't running as a charity, but for those who appreciate a well-kept paradise and don't mind supporting the people who make it special, Nui Beach is more than worth it. If adventure, exclusivity, and stunning scenery sound like your kind of day, you'll love it here as much as we did!\n\nAnd a special mention: the owner's replies to brainrotted reviews are truly a gem of their own -some of the best communication I've seen, pure and honest. That alone makes this appreciation review worth writing. Recommended 🥰\n\n(If you disagree; get yourself checked, mentally.)",

I did make it on a scooter, so it is possible on a scooter or motorcycle, however I would not recommend this for a novice rider.  The terrain is very steep with lots of rocks and washouts.  Also be warned they have started collecting a fee to visit and a little man literally sprinted to me with his hand out to collect the 100 baht fee before I could even park and get off my bike.  They then added a 20 baht \"parking\" fee.  The whole thing was very scam-y.  In the big picture the fee and risk of personal injury is probably worth it to access the beach.  The whole place has a very pirate vibe with several bars and great picture points.  They have spent lots of time and energy to decorate it very well.  Overall...worth it...if you are aware of the risk and cost!",

So you might want to hike there (or drive you scooter if you have good suspensions). Also, locals provide 4x4 taxi and ATV services. The journey through the jungle is worth it.",

The staff and services are so good and friendly. The foods have many options and are delicious. I can feel freshy of their foods.  The restaurant has two types of table services as with the roof, and under the tree. It is such a perfect combination and location for  dining and enjoying your drinks beside the sea views and atmosphere. I can say that I wanna be here again.",

M is shown on the picture and it was BIG! Only thing that it tasted like regular rice fried with egg, no any other seasoning or veggies which you can find from other local places in fried rice. Chicken was moist, but there wasn't plenty of it. Seems that portion grows by rice, not by add-ins.\n\nThey charge for glass of ice 10b, so be aware when ordering drinks.\n\nFood arrived really quick.",
