As mentioned in other reviews, the resort is divided into two sides, but we didn't find the split to be an issue at all. The grounds are truly beautiful, and while the room layout is a bit unique, we found it charming and comfortable. The beds, in particular, were very comfortable, which made for restful nights.\n\nThe service was excellent throughout our stay. The front desk staff went above and beyond when we needed medical assistance due to an upset stomach-they quickly connected us with a nearby clinic and ensured we had what we needed. They also helped us locate a reliable laundry service, which we really appreciated.\n\nOne point of constructive feedback: the resort has a policy of no outside food or drink in the pool area near the beach. We had brought smoothies from a nearby café and were told we couldn't enjoy them at our chairs, but could step just a few feet away to the tree line. While we understand the policy, it felt a bit rigid given the location's distance from other options (about a 5–10 minute walk each way).\n\nThat said, our overall experience was very positive. The property is just as described-relaxing, scenic, and well-maintained. We would happily return.",

The place is absolutely beautiful – the design, the vibe, everything feels so calming and luxurious without being too over-the-top. The staff were super friendly and attentive, always smiling and happy to help with anything.\n\nThe food? Amazing. Every meal was delicious, especially the breakfast – so many options and everything tasted fresh and well-made. We also had dinner by the beach, and the view of the sunset while eating was just perfect.\n\nSpecial shoutout to the lovely staff who made our experience even better – At Pinto, Sa, Mam, Nid, Dear, Preaw, Ball, and Fai took such great care of us during breakfast. And in the evening, Janny, Q, Ain, Stang, and Mas were all so friendly and attentive. Everyone was warm, smiling, and always ready to help – we truly felt welcomed and well taken care of. 💛\n\nAnd speaking of the beach – the view is next level. Crystal clear water, soft sand, and just such a peaceful atmosphere. It's one of those places that makes you feel like you're really on vacation.\n\nHighly recommend if you're looking for a relaxing getaway with great service, great food, and a beautiful ocean view.",

The rooms were stylish and comfortable, the amenities were top-notch, and the staff truly went above and beyond. A special thank you to Alina, who made our experience even more memorable with her kindness and professionalism. She was absolutely outstanding.\n\nHowever, our last day left a bitter taste. We were unexpectedly denied access to the beach club due to a private event. While we understand these things happen, the way it was handled by the manager was incredibly disappointing. Instead of offering a solution or showing empathy, he kept repeating, “Today you will check out,” as if that excused everything. I explained that our entire reason for booking this stay was the beach club, and even if we were checking out, it was part of our experience. His tone was rude, dismissive, and completely unprofessional.\n\nA beautiful place, but management needs serious improvement when it comes to guest relations-especially when issues arise. Without that, even the best hotel loses its magic.",

The reason this beach is rarely crowded is that it is only accessible via a short but steep hike down a hill or by long-tail boat transfer during high season. It is worth the effort.",

There are few people and a lot of space.\n\nThe wide shoreline, hidden sunbeds and umbrellas, make this beautiful beach wild. Practically nothing has been changed here by human hands!\n\nThe flora is amazing: a large number of: different trees, massive shrubs, palm trees, beautiful stones and everything else.\n\nThe sand here is very soft, light in color. Turquoise, clear sea. Good depth and there are no low tides (watch the tides in the appendix)!

They dropped us off at a booth that makes you pay 100 baht per person. After reading, they make you pay this for walking through their land to get to the beach. After walking about 10 minutes down some dirt path with stairs, we finally made it to some rocks that we had to climb down to get to the beach. Once there, we quickly realized why it was called freedom beach. There is weed everywhere, everyone is just chillin on towels and enjoying life. The vibes here are spot on and 100% worth the journey for couples and single people (not families). The journey back up seemed like it would be easier since there are stairs but the stairs were a joke because they led you to a pickup truck that costs 100 baht per person. The alternative was to climb up a mountain basically so my recommendation is to bring water and sneakers so you can get to and from the beach easily and safely. Also the grabs picking you up won't come all the way up to pick you up so that was quite a journey to navigate.",

The sunset from this beach is very beautiful and you have a chance also during the day to play with the crabs on the the beach and maybe also to meet a monkey or two (I did not have this chance). You can go into the water without  water shoes easily in the first half of the beach.",

It was indeed quite empty, but I believe this is because of the sea waves.\n\nThe path to the beach is quite tricky, when the sea level is high, when it is lower, the trickiest part from Surin you can make just by the beach.\n\nI added photos from this pathway to the review.\n\nAlso, please be careful, if you want to swim in the farthest part of the beach. There are a lot of underwater rocks and stones, When sea level is low and waves it is very easy to hurt yourself with such stones",

The front desk staff especially Jerry was helpful and even recommended some great places to visit nearby.\n\nWe booked a Superior Ocean Side Room, and it exceeded our expectations. The room was clean, spacious, and comfortable, and from the balcony, we had a beautiful view of the beach. Beach access was also very convenient, just a short walk from the room.\n\nBefore arriving, we were a little anxious after reading some negative reviews, but our experience was exceptional. If you want your room made up, the staff comes promptly, and their app is super helpful for requesting extra water, amenities, room service, or restaurant services.\n\nOur booking included breakfast, and there were plenty of varieties to choose from - the food was delicious! We also had dinner twice at Soul Kitchen, and the food was amazing, especially the mango salad - a must-try!\n\nThe beach was stunning, and the sunset views were breathtaking. On one rainy day, the beach wasn't as clean, but on other days, it was very well-maintained.\n\nOverall, a fantastic stay - great service, delicious food, comfortable rooms, and a beautiful beach. Highly recommended! 🌅",

Breakfast buffet is average, I think they could probably do better but it's okay for the price. I suggest changing the blue placemat (ที่รองจาน) at Soul Kitchen because they have lots of stains on them and feels quite dirty, although the restaurant itself seems quite clean. Live music at dinner time was great and the view was amazing. But while the live singer was resting, the music was not vibing and they also come with commercial ads (probably Youtube or Spotify ads) every 2-3 songs. I think the hotel should just invest in Spotify premium or Youtube premium to solve this issue because bad music really kills the vibe. Nevertheless, all the staff are very nice and helpful, I appreciate all of their help. One name I remember was Shuyaa, he's very polite and helpful. Every staff member here deserves a praise.\n\nThe public bathroom at the pool could be cleaner though. the floor is always wet. I think better sanitation would make this hotel even more pleasant.",

Food quality was good too. The dinner was also great, with kids menu as well.\n\nRooms were really a hit and miss; some rooms were higher up on the hill offering better views, some had no views at all and were sort of at the \"basement\" of that block.\nThe entire compound is on a hill so there are no lifts, hence the need for buggies to ferry guests. We were fortunate to visit during lull season, so there were no delays. But I can imagine during peak season when the hotel is full, there will definitely be waiting time. It is possible to walk down hill to the main restaurants and pool but walking up hill is a real climb. Room cleanliness is alright, floor tiles looked a bit dated. Overall still good!

It's about 1 km to the beach, and the hotel is a bit uphill, but not much so it's kind of a perfect walk after breakfast.\n\nThe best part of view from the room. It is absolutely stunning, we spent many evenings chilling at the balcony 🍷🍷\n\nBreakfast is very good, pretty diverse, fruits, vegetables, everything you need\n\nThe rooms themselves were also great\n\nThe staff is wonderful and friendly, we loved it.\n\nDefinitely recommend it",

For someone that has travelled to Thailand for 30 years now, whether this is your first trip or a repeat visitor, I would highly recommend this Hotel as the perfect experience. The staff are all super friendly and very helpful, in particular Yuth, who manages the breakfast / operations seamlessly, and Doe (who literally saved a child from drowning while serving drinks with no concern for his iPhone that was in his pocket) as well as the magnificent room service menu (try the humus with lamb) as well as one of the best receptions, pool area that I've experienced. The fact that they are elevated makes the cool breeze set the scene for your stay as well as good vibes that run through the hotel. I've re-booked already and was really blessed to have managed to stay here. Bravo to all the team !!!",
