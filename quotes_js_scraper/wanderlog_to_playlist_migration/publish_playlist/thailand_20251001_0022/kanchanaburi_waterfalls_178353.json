There are 7 levels and I have to say it's hard work in the heat to get to the top and there are some very steep steps and lots of them. It is 1550m to level 7 from the start. If you go here you must try and go all the way to the top if possible.\n\nCouple of things to note:\n1. You can not take plastic/glass bottles with you. There is a bottle station that will take them off you to collect on your way down. I would buy a big personal drinks container and fill with water you will need it\n\n2. You can swim in some of the pools but the fish there will have a nibble on you so be warned. They don't bite just nibble at your skin.\n\nI took a private taxi that took me to Erawan Falls, Tiger Temple, Jamjuree (old big tree) and meena cafe he picked us up at 10:00 and dropped us off at a restaurant at 19:00  and this cost us 2000 baht. I have to say this was worth it because the public bus to Erawan was small, old, no air con and basic seats.",

            "text": "Erawan Waterfall is a stunning, multi-tiered waterfall located in Erawan National Park in Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand. It is renowned for its picturesque emerald green pools and seven distinct levels, each offering a unique swimming and exploration experience. The falls are named after the three-headed white elephant of Hindu mythology, with the top tier said to resemble Erawan.\n\nThe waterfall cascades down seven levels, each with its own characteristics and swimming opportunities.\n\nThe water in the pools is a vibrant turquoise or emerald green color, making for a picturesque scene.\n\nVisitors can swim in the pools at each level, and the higher tiers offer more challenging hikes with steeper trails and beautiful forest scenery.\n\nThe park is home to diverse wildlife, including fish that nibble at your feet in the pools.\n\nThere are various nature trails, including the Khao Hin Lan Pee Trail, offering a quieter experience and opportunities to explore caves and the surrounding forest.\n\nThe first three tiers are relatively easy to access, while the higher tiers require more effort and sturdy shoes for the steeper climbs.\n\nFood is not allowed past the second level, and water bottles may require a refundable deposit to encourage responsible waste disposal.\n\nErawan Waterfall is a popular destination, so expect to encounter other visitors, especially on weekends.",

            "text": "The area is beautiful,  consists of 7 waterfalls. There are golf carts that can help you get to the first few levels, but after that you're on your own.\n\nIt is definitely a hike and you need to be ready to walk/trek and the path is not smooth.\n\nYou can swim normally in some of the waterfalls, some only with a life jacket (which you can rent) and some you cannot swim at all.\n\nI recommend renting a life jacket and swimming in the earlier levels, as level 7 is the \"pinnacle\", but there are small fish there that keep biting you, and no one was comfortable swimming in level 7.\n\nI wish they sold snacks/drinks at the higher levels, because after the early levels there is nothing but the watefalls, and they take your food/drinks at that checkpoint.\n\nIt's beautiful,  requires a lot of physical effort,  and it was rather underwhelming overall.\nPictures are better than the reality.\n\nIf you want to save money,  stay in Kanchanaburi and just take a bus or a grab to Erawan.",
