The layout is spacious and clean, and the air-conditioning is always pleasant—especially welcome in Coimbatore’s warm weather. ❄️\n\nThe food court is decent with many choices—both veg and non-veg—like KFC, Dominos, Sree Annapoorna, and more. 🍕🍗🍛 There are also some nice cafes if you want to relax with a coffee. ☕🧁 The seating area can get crowded during weekends, but staff manage it well.\n\nThere's also a PVR cinema inside the mall which is well-maintained and a great option for movie lovers. 🎬🍿 Washrooms are clean and hygiene standards are mostly well kept. The mall also offers free Wi-Fi and good security at all entry points. 📶🛡️\n\nThe only drawback is that parking can be a bit hectic during weekends or holidays. 🅿️🚦 Also, it would be great if there were more seating areas for elderly people or those not interested in shopping."

There are so many natural plants / trees such that a minimal cleaning would encourage a lot of people to visit often, but not sure why it is not done.  Fortunately, we had some drinking water facilities available in few locations.\nHope this gets some better maintenance in the future."

The entire area is having greenery and some areas are not well maintained and need some attention. Drinking water kiosks are kept at a couple of points. Entry fee is 50/-. There is a nursery beside the garden premises. The area is good for photography as it is having lush greenery and photogenic locations. We could see students from Agricultural University when we had gone. When we had gone there we could also see 'couples' having their time...What a more perfect way to relax under a shade of tree than any other part of the city???!!!😄😁 (July 2025)"

From the moment I stepped in, I was surrounded by an explosion of colors—roses, lilies, orchids, and countless other flowers in full bloom, each more breathtaking than the last.\n\nBeyond the floral displays, the festival had so much to offer. Interactive events, cultural performances, and workshops added a dynamic touch, making the experience more immersive. The art expo was a delightful surprise, showcasing stunning botanical-themed paintings and sculptures that beautifully captured the essence of nature.\n\nStrolling through the stalls, I discovered unique handmade crafts, aromatic floral teas, and eco-friendly products, each telling a story of passion and craftsmanship. The entire atmosphere felt like a celebration of beauty, creativity, and sustainability.\n\nEvery corner of the festival held a picture-perfect moment, from intricate floral arrangements to the joyous expressions of fellow visitors. It was more than just an event—it was a sensory journey, leaving me inspired and refreshed."

Detailed descriptions for each model made it a treat for car enthusiasts.\nThe science museum was equally impressive, showcasing vintage household appliances that gave a fascinating glimpse into the past. A must-visit for kids (and kids-at-heart!) to appreciate how far we've come. What truly impressed me was the impeccable maintenance of the exhibits - everything looked pristine and well-preserved.\nWe spent around 1.5 hours exploring both exhibits and left feeling inspired and informed. Highly recommend!"

However, there are interactive models of car engines and gears where you can observe their working mechanisms, by shifting the gears yourself, which adds an educational and hands-on element. The entry ticket price is on the higher side, so it might not feel like great value for money if you're primarily interested in a vast collection of classic vehicles. Overall, it's a decent spot for enthusiasts who appreciate mechanical details and history."

It houses a wide range of preserved specimens, including rare wood samples, taxidermy animals, and historical artifacts related to forest management in India.\n\n💰 Entry fee: ₹40 for locals, ₹200 for foreigners. While the price difference is significant, it’s still a reasonable cost for such a niche and informative museum.\n\n🛎️ Staff experience: Unfortunately, the staff at the entrance seemed quite uninterested, which didn’t make for the most welcoming first impression.\n\n🏛️ The museum itself is worth visiting—it’s well-maintained, has a lot of interesting exhibits, and offers a unique look at India’s rich forest history. It’s not a large museum, but if you enjoy natural history, botany, or forestry, you’ll likely find it fascinating.\n\n🔹 Tip: The museum is relatively quiet, making it a good spot for an unhurried visit. Expect to spend about 1-2 hours exploring.\n\nOverall, it’s a great place for nature and history enthusiasts, but the experience could be improved with friendlier staff and better engagement at the entrance.\n\n⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ – Worth a visit, but don’t expect a warm welcome!"

              "reviewText": "V O Chidambaranar Park and Zoo, popularly called VOC Park, is a compact zoological garden and amusement park in central Coimbatore, spanning about 4.5 acres  . Established in 1965, it was managed by the municipal corporation and once housed roughly 500–890 animals, including birds, mammals, and reptiles  . The park featured a children’s play area, aquarium, toy‑train, and a “Jurassic” dinosaur-themed section set within landscaped gardens  .\n\nIt also hosted fairs, cultural events and public celebrations on Republic and Independence Day, and contained over 200 tree species, including sandalwood  .\n\nHowever, the zoo’s licence was cancelled by the Central Zoo Authority in January 2022, leading to its permanent closure and relocation of most animals to other state facilities. Plans are in progress to convert the premises into an aviary or bird‑park under municipal redevelopment efforts  ."

The idol of Vinayagar is impressive, and the aarthi was a treat to witness.\n\nHowever, there was a bit of a rush, so if you're short on time or prefer less crowd, you might want to plan your visit accordingly.\n\nThe pooja items outside the temple were overpriced; a coconut, two bananas, and no flowers cost ₹120, which seemed steep.\n\nTrustees to have temple own shop and provide reasonable price to devotees\n\nThe temple atmosphere was serene, and the prashadam, Sakarai Pongal, was delicious.\n\nParking was challenging due to the temple's location on the main road.\n\nDespite the pricing concerns, we'd recommend visiting with family and friends. Coimbatore residents are indeed lucky to have this temple nearby.\n\nVinayagar Thunai! 🙏"

It's easily noticeable and accessible due to the presence of the huge and beautiful Ganesha statue that stands as the main attraction. The temple is peaceful and attracts devotees from all over, especially those traveling along this route. One of the highlights is the daily abhishegam (ritual bathing of the idol), which is done with devotion and draws a good number of visitors.\n\nWhile the temple experience is spiritual and calming, one thing to note is that the flower shops outside tend to overcharge for coconuts, flowers, and pooja items. It’s a good idea to be aware of the prices or bring your offerings from elsewhere if possible.\n\nOverall, it’s a divine and spiritually uplifting place worth visiting, especially for those who seek blessings from Lord Ganesha during travel or important beginnings."

The entire premises were well maintained, clean, and neatly arranged—credit goes to the temple authorities and the support of local people.\n\nWe chose to walk up the steps to reach the temple, and although it was a long climb, the journey was worth every step. It became a beautiful experience, especially with my family.\n\nThe sightseeing and the artistic wall paintings inside the temple were truly stunning—absolutely captivating. The vibrant colors and cultural richness made our visit feel very special. It was a colorful and spiritually uplifting day that we'll always remember."

The temple is located on a serene hilltop and is very easy to reach, even if you're staying 14 km away from the area.\n\nWe stayed near Gandhipuram, and opted for public transport. We took the 70-number bus, which dropped us at the foothills. From there, government buses are arranged to take devotees to the top. The shuttle system is well-managed, with tickets costing ₹20 one way. Even though there was a big crowd, three buses were running in rotation, so everything moved smoothly.\n\nThe atmosphere at the temple was filled with energy and peace. The queue management and transportation setup made the visit hassle-free. We got enough time for darshan and to explore every part of the temple calmly.\n\nIf you're planning to visit, I highly recommend using public transport—it’s affordable and efficient. A beautiful spiritual experience overall!"

The temple is at the base of the hills of western ghats.\nIt is said to be over a 1000yrs old temple with visitors coming from all over India.\n\nI went on Friday evening, the experience of going to the temple was not pleasant as we had to wait at the foothills for more than 1 hrs just to go to the top of the hill.\nThere are people manning the entrance of foothill with security. The stop vehicle movement and charge 20rs for parking.\nThe foothills to the entrance closes at 7pm, even local bus service to the top closes at 7pm.\n\nOnce you go to the hilltop, Darshan is available until 8:30pm.\n\nThe place has not developed much. Lots of inconvenience for visitors. No proper parking, lack of basic amenities like public toilet, drinking water etc.\n\nVery limited shops near the temple.\n\nThe only good thing is having darshan of Lord Murugan. We were lucky to see Abhishekam of Muruga as well at 8pm.\n\nApart from that the place doesn't give a good temple atmosphere or a serene experience.\n\nGovt must take up the task of developing the place at foothills with hotels and shops for visitors. May be due to forest area and western ghats they might have restricted the development activities also.\n\nThere are elephant movement at stairways when going towards the hilltop. Please be careful and do not litter the place.\n\nTry visiting during morning hours on weekdays for a better experience.\nOm Muruga.\nVetrivel Muruganukku Arogara."

As a devotee, I truly hope to see more development, especially in terms of facilities during the summer season. We visited on an extremely hot day, and unfortunately, there were no special arrangements in place—such as shaded walkways—to help people cope with the heat. Devotees walking from the base of the temple really struggled due to the lack of shelter from the sun. Clean and well-maintained restrooms are also much needed. There's nothing wrong in taking inspiration from other places to improve the temple’s infrastructure, as long as it’s done without compromising its tradition and cultural heritage. Personally, I didn’t notice much development compared to my previous visit in the early 2000s."

We saw only a very few people. Nice to have a good time with family members.\n2. Neat and clean. Photos shared. They have enough staff to make sure park and premises are well kept.\n3. Water quality - we were bit worried when we enetered the park. But water was crystal clear, only adequate amount of chlorination, no stagnant or foul smelling areas.\n4. Staff behavior is very polite and supportive. They are readily available for services. No hesitation or delay in addressing our needs.\n5. All equipments are quality products. Kids friendly.\n6. Clothes and equipment inside shop were very reasonable priced.\n\nCons.\n1. Canteen is not fully functioning. Very limited range of menu.\n2. Entry fee is little high. That may be a reason many people not coming.\n3. Parking area is limited. We were lucky to get a parking space.\n\nOverall a must visit place in Coimbatore. Highly recommended to families."

It's Near the Local vegetation so wild animals and birds like a peocock is a common spectacle on the racetrack which is lethal for anybody who is using the racetrack. The track also has a good vantage point called the Rolon Tower from where one can have a good look at the whole racing track. However, reaching back anywhere from here is a challenge it is located on the outskirts of the city and local commute to and from your accommodation is a challenging task."

Hanuman on his journey with Mount Meru is believed to be offered with water by Lord Murugan / Karthikeyan by creating a water source for him in this hill, which is even now present as Sunai. Murugan is with Valli & Devasena. There is an excellent temple for Hanuman, Shiva above at little more height. Steps are very comfortable though it will be much hotter during the day time. Those sensitive to walking on bare foot on hot steps may use their footwear till the top, and there is a place where one can leave it.\n\nAfternoon, post pooja, abhishegam and aarathi temple provides Annadhanam as lunch for 50 visitors each day, which is double for special days, tokens are issued in the ticket counter as first come first  served. Sure one has to be blessed to have it here. One can donate for Annadhanam at the same counter.\n\nAt the bottom of the hill, near the entrance to the steps is a must to visit Agasthiyar Ashram, has 18 Siddhar established and worshipped. Full moon day is very auspicious.\n\nAbundant open car parking at the bottom of the hill, near the entrance under tree shades.\n\nVel Vel Muruga, Vetri Vel Muruga!"

Right from the moment I stepped inside the temple premises, I felt enveloped by a sense of calm and devotion that words can hardly describe.\n\nThe temple is beautifully maintained, radiating divinity and serenity amidst the bustling city. The main sanctum of Lord Ayyappa, adorned with exquisite decorations and the constant chanting of bhajans, fills the heart with deep devotion and peace. The rituals and poojas are performed with utmost discipline and dedication, making every visit feel sacred and fulfilling.\n\nThe temple architecture, though simple, exudes traditional Kerala-style charm, and the surrounding cleanliness adds to the overall divine atmosphere. The priests are very courteous, guiding devotees with devotion and respect.\n\nOffering prayers here fills one with renewed faith, positive energy, and a deep connection with Lord Ayyappa. I left the temple premises with a heart full of blessings and a mind filled with tranquility.\n\nA must-visit for anyone seeking spiritual solace in Coimbatore. Swamiye Saranam Ayyappa!"

Decent parking area to accommodate at least 40 cars .\n3. The auditorium was well lit and ventilated. Even though it was a full house the temperature was comfortable.\n4. The entire space was very clean and had a fresh scent, despite having a show earlier and was scheduled to have one after the 7 pm one.\n\nDislikes\n1. The sinage to the place needs to be placed strategically for people to notice it. If missed, one will need to take a U turn at KMCH head all the way to Jennys for another U turn and the reach here."

They don't give any sauces/dips for burger or roll. What one they gave was so watery, had no taste. Packed some pastries that were definitely too overpriced considering the portion size."

The photographer was prompt in communicating and took the time to understand my vision. Whether it was suggesting poses, selecting the perfect backdrop, or adjusting the lighting for the ideal shot, their expertise was evident throughout the session.\n\nThe studio itself was well-equipped with high-quality lighting, a variety of backdrops, and even props that helped bring my ideas to life. The atmosphere was professional yet comfortable, which made me feel at ease in front of the camera.\n\nWhat impressed me the most was their attention to detail. The photographer captured not just photos but moments, with a keen eye for composition and emotion. The final edits were delivered promptly, and the quality was outstanding—clear, vibrant, and true to the mood we had discussed.\n\nI also appreciated their flexibility and patience, especially during wardrobe changes and when working with my kids, who were part of the shoot. It’s rare to find a photographer who is equally skilled at managing technical aspects and creating a relaxed, enjoyable experience.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend Yabesh Photography for anyone looking for professional, high-quality photography. Whether it’s for portraits, events, or product shoots, their dedication to excellence truly sets them apart. I’ll definitely be returning for future sessions!"

There are so much card and board games to make you get indulged with ones you visit. If you are in a hurry, then this is not your place. It takes time,more than usual to serve you things that you ordered. Taste of dishes were good. You can celebrate birthdays in a private hall here. Then about the cost, its definitely little expensive, I ld say. A place to try atleast once. Worth it."
