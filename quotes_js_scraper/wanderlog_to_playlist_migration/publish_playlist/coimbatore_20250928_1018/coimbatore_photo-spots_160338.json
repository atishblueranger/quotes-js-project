Detailed descriptions for each model made it a treat for car enthusiasts.\nThe science museum was equally impressive, showcasing vintage household appliances that gave a fascinating glimpse into the past. A must-visit for kids (and kids-at-heart!) to appreciate how far we've come. What truly impressed me was the impeccable maintenance of the exhibits - everything looked pristine and well-preserved.\nWe spent around 1.5 hours exploring both exhibits and left feeling inspired and informed. Highly recommend!",

However, there are interactive models of car engines and gears where you can observe their working mechanisms, by shifting the gears yourself, which adds an educational and hands-on element. The entry ticket price is on the higher side, so it might not feel like great value for money if you're primarily interested in a vast collection of classic vehicles. Overall, it's a decent spot for enthusiasts who appreciate mechanical details and history.",

The park featured a children's play area, aquarium, toy‑train, and a “Jurassic” dinosaur-themed section set within landscaped gardens  .\n\nIt also hosted fairs, cultural events and public celebrations on Republic and Independence Day, and contained over 200 tree species, including sandalwood  .\n\nHowever, the zoo's licence was cancelled by the Central Zoo Authority in January 2022, leading to its permanent closure and relocation of most animals to other state facilities.
