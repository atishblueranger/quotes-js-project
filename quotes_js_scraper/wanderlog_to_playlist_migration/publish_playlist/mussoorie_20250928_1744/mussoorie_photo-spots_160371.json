The moment you step in, there's a sense of calm that surrounds you - perfect for just sitting in silence or soaking in the peaceful energy. The view from the nearby buddha statue on mountain top is absolutely breathtaking, with a 360-degree panorama of the surrounding mountain ranges that seem to stretch endlessly into the sky. When I visited, a small group was sitting nearby, softly playing the guitar, and it added such a warm, soulful vibe to the already serene atmosphere. It's the kind of place where you can pause, breathe, and just feel completely at peace.",

Unfortunately, it just never happened.\n\nI do appreciate the effort that went into setting up the space and creating the models, but the experience was underwhelming. At ₹100 per person, and with four of us visiting, it honestly felt like a bit of a waste.\n\nA lot of the figures didn't look very realistic. They lacked the detail and finish you'd usually expect. Some of them looked quite fake, which really took away from the overall experience.\n\nThere was also a strange emphasis on Western pop celebrities. While that's not necessarily bad, I did expect to see more Indian figures, especially considering the location. A better balance would have made the visit more meaningful and memorable.\n\nAll in all, it's a decent attempt, but it just didn't have the impact or excitement we were hoping for.",

Entry ticket 200 rupee for Indians , it's advisable to park your vehicle at entry gate as the path in sanctuary is not conductive for vehicles. Take your own water and food while trekking . Better to take a stick to ward of reptiles and animals . Some resorts are there near its entry gate",
