We kept going and looking for the scenic point but reached the end at church were people were parking their bikes and cars. There we asked about Scenic Point to the parking guy he said it was behind and there is nothing like scenic point, it's a cafe and its misleading many people about standalone scenic point.\nEveryone were disappointed about this.\nWe went all around once again ( because it's a one way so) to see that cafe. I have attached the photos of that cafe see. We didn't go inside the cafe because it was very foggy.\nGiving one star because of misleading of name."

At around 7,800 feet above sea level, it offers the most breathtaking views of the Himalayan ranges, including peaks like Nanda Devi, Badrinath, and Kedarnath on a clear day.\n\nYou can reach Lal Tibba by taxi, bike, or even a peaceful uphill walk if you enjoy trekking. There are a few cafés and view points with telescopes that let you see the snow-covered mountains more closely. The place is quiet and less crowded than Mall Road, making it perfect for people who want to enjoy peace with nature.\n\nThe best time to visit is from March to June and September to November, when the skies are clear. Early mornings and evenings are the best for photography, as the sunlight makes the mountains look golden.\n\nLal Tibba is not just about views—it also gives you a glimpse of the old colonial charm of Landour, with small houses, churches, and pine-covered roads nearby.\n\nIt’s a must-visit if you want to see Mussoorie’s true beauty from the top of the hills. 🌄"

I would recommend to reach there around 4-5 PM, and then enjoy different shades of sky. It is good for sunset view as well.\n\nThere are some shops for quick chai and snacks.

              "reviewText": "Mussoorie Lake is a decent place to stop by if you're already exploring the town, but it didn’t fully meet expectations. The lake itself is small and artificial, surrounded by basic paddle boating options and a few snack stalls. The natural setting around it is nice, offering scenic hills and fresh air, which adds to the charm.\n\nHowever, the lake area feels a bit commercialized. The entry fee is low, but once inside, everything else — boating, snacks, and even photos — adds up quickly. Cleanliness is average; the water wasn’t very clear, and there was some litter around, which was disappointing given how beautiful the area could be.\n\nIt gets quite crowded, especially on weekends and holidays, which takes away from the peaceful hill-station vibe. Parking can also be tricky.\n\nThere are some small shops and eateries nearby, and you can get decent views for pictures. But overall, Mussoorie Lake feels more like a quick stop than a proper destination.\n\nIt’s not a bad experience, especially for families with kids, but with better maintenance and less crowding, it could be a much more enjoyable and memorable spot.\n\n---"

You give 30-50 ₹ per person for the tickets if u r Indian and what all u can see is just a swimming pool. Charging for it should be a sin. There are no specific views or anything which is worth paying for. Also I think the pic I am attaching with this post looks much better than that it does in reality. So choose wisely whether u want to go here or go somewhere better."

A man-made pool of water!"

The city board developed the lake as a picnic spot recently. The lake was formed due to a natural waterfall. Though small, this lake is really pretty. You can also visit the waterfall nearby to make most of your trip. You will find ducks swimming in the lake. You can hire a paddle boat and go for a ride to enjoy the surrounding views which are breathe taking. There is a ropeway for all tourist. Older people can also enjoy the lake with the help of ropeway."

We saw it on our walk the first day and then got the chance to visit it on 23rd June 2022. the entry is via a short uphill road. As you stand outside and see the small iron gate and the few steps inside, you can feel the magic. The Building is pretty old British and teleports you back in time. The sky was absolutely beautiful as I clicked some pics. No-one stopped up as we entered the courtyard. We were admiring the views when the caretaker came to us and asked us if we wanted to see the inside. What an opportunity. The inside is amazing with stained glass artwork, the Gothic architecture and deep silence. We stayed there for a couple of minutes, made a small donation and came back outside. Oh, what a wonderful experience. Must visit, if you are at Mussoorie."

However, we decided to walk down - which was quite the hike. It's paved roads and super nice views on the way down. But it's far, and steep. It's several hundred meters in height difference. So it's like 1h to get down through steep roads and 1.5h to get up again. It's a tough walk so if you're not fit I'd recommend some kind of taxi or driver. Again, it's very steep, but paved."

Nestled amidst lush greenery and scenic views of the hills, it offers a peaceful retreat for families, couples, and nature lovers alike.\n\nThe garden is well-maintained and features a beautiful collection of flowers, fountains, and trimmed lawns. One of its main highlights is the colorful flowerbeds that bloom vibrantly during the spring and summer months, creating a picturesque setting. There is also a small artificial waterfall and boating pond, which adds to the charm and provides a relaxing activity for visitors.\n\nFor those traveling with children, the garden has a mini amusement park with rides and activities that keep kids entertained. There are also several food stalls and a small market selling souvenirs, local handicrafts, and snacks. The entry fee is nominal, making it an affordable outing option.\n\nThough it can get crowded during peak season, the overall ambiance remains pleasant. Visitors looking for a quieter experience may prefer to go early in the morning or on weekdays.\n\nOne drawback is that the place could benefit from better signage and maintenance in some areas. Despite this, Company Garden is still a worthwhile visit for anyone coming to Mussoorie, especially those who enjoy casual walks in nature and spending time outdoors.\n\nIn summary, Company Garden is a refreshing and family-friendly destination that adds charm to any Mussoorie itinerary."

The multi-level concept adds a unique charm.\nFrom a beautiful flower garden to a small soothing waterfall, every corner feels like a breath of fresh air.\n\nThe place is extremely well maintained, and even the rule of not touching any flowers, not even the fallen ones, shows how much effort goes into preserving its beauty—and it's honestly a good rule to keep it maintained.\n\nThe garden also has a food court inside, a few shopping stalls for local finds, and photographer (paid basis) to capture your moments . Whether you're here with family or clicking photos for your feed, there’s something for everyone.\n\nEntry is ₹50 for both kids and adults, while little ones under 3 enter free. A peaceful, vibrant spot worth visiting!"

It is located about 3 km from Mall Road (Library Bazaar side) and is easy to reach by rickshaw, taxi, or even a pleasant walk.\n\nThe garden is well maintained with colorful flowers, green lawns, and fountains that make it look very lively.

Since it is close to the main town, you don’t need much travel time, making it one of the easiest and most enjoyable spots in Mussoorie."

The place is beautifully maintained—gorgeous flowers, flowing waterfalls, and a calm, scenic vibe that just makes you want to stroll around forever. Even the little street market inside is charming and full of colour.\n\nNow, I will say the constant “Madam, photo?” every few steps gets old real quick. I came to enjoy the view, not star in a photo shoot. But hey, small price to pay.\n\nAnd speaking of price, at just ₹50 per person, this place is an absolute steal. Clean, scenic, well-managed, and affordable? Yes, please. Definitely a must-visit if you’re anywhere nearby."

Unfortunately, it just never happened.\n\nI do appreciate the effort that went into setting up the space and creating the models, but the experience was underwhelming. At ₹100 per person, and with four of us visiting, it honestly felt like a bit of a waste.\n\nA lot of the figures didn’t look very realistic. They lacked the detail and finish you’d usually expect. Some of them looked quite fake, which really took away from the overall experience.\n\nThere was also a strange emphasis on Western pop celebrities. While that’s not necessarily bad, I did expect to see more Indian figures, especially considering the location. A better balance would have made the visit more meaningful and memorable.\n\nAll in all, it’s a decent attempt, but it just didn’t have the impact or excitement we were hoping for."

The museum houses around 26 wax figures of notable personalities, including Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, and Michael Jackson. While some statues may not perfectly resemble their real-life counterparts, the effort to showcase such a diverse range of figures is commendable.\n\nThe entry fee is ₹100 per person, which I found reasonable for the experience. The museum is open from 10:00 am to 5:00 pm, making it a convenient stop during a day at the Company Garden. The staff were courteous and maintained the premises well. Spending about 30 minutes here was sufficient to appreciate the exhibits. Overall, it's a pleasant addition to the Mussoorie itinerary, especially for those interested in art and history."

There is a water fountain, a water fall, a flower plants nursery and a Cactus garden. Lots of photo opportunities are there for couples and individuals. For kids there is a small toy train, small boating area, wax museum, kids games, snacks shops, gift shops and restaurants.\n\n9-D VR is also there which costs you ₹200/- per person which I personally didnt like at all.\n\nentry ticket for wax museum is ₹100/- per person which can be visited in hardly 15-20 minutes. You can also take picutres there with the statues 😅. Museum is just average if you have time then go for it otherwise it is not worth it. Attendant keeps following you everywhere due to which you get concious even looking the statues properly\n\nOverall it is a small package having something for all."

The moment you step in, there’s a sense of calm that surrounds you - perfect for just sitting in silence or soaking in the peaceful energy. The view from the nearby buddha statue on mountain top is absolutely breathtaking, with a 360-degree panorama of the surrounding mountain ranges that seem to stretch endlessly into the sky. When I visited, a small group was sitting nearby, softly playing the guitar, and it added such a warm, soulful vibe to the already serene atmosphere. It’s the kind of place where you can pause, breathe, and just feel completely at peace."

He was very passionate about the reserve, knowledgeable and enthusiastic. I never felt unsafe. The scenery was beautiful with the Rhodedondron trees flowering and I was offered tea at the end of the hike. A highlight was seeing the snow-capped mountains in the distance. On my request, my guide then left me to explore a bit longer on my own. It was a peaceful day away from the busyness of Massourie and I can highligy recommend."

              "reviewText": "Records dating back to the mid-1800s show that the property was originally known as Rockville and acquired by a Dr Wright. During the 1800s, the main purpose of the Estate, like most other forests in the area, was to generate income through the sale of wood for charcoal to meet the needs of the Mussoorie town, the brewery and the cantonment. Until 1887, this cutting and selling of wood seems to have been unabated until the Mussoorie Municipality sent a notice to the Estate Manager asking him to stop the further felling of trees and expressed concern about “large scale tree felling” and “laying the hillside bare”. This appears to be the first attempt at managing the unchecked exploitation of the forest in some way.\nDedicated efforts have been taking place since 2015 to transform this sizeable tract of privately owned land into a nature reserve, home to abundant animals, birdlife and wild flowers. While you'll need luck to spot mammals, camera traps have caught leopard, black bear, porcupine and several species of deer. There are hiking trails and specialist guides available\n\nEntry tickets cost Rs. 450 per person. Guides are available at Rs.700 per person. It is best to go on a guided tour because the 300 acre reserve is not easy to navigate. Do carry drinking water with you as there is no provision for food or water inside"

Trekking can be quite a strenuous activity if one is out of shape.  Since this reserve is apparently privately owned and operated, there was a substantial entry fee, and there was a doubt whether all members of the party would be able to undertake this ardous activity. Nevertheless, walking sticks were acquired, tkts were purchased and off we went. The initial impression was underwhelming, since the trek we had taken to reach the nature reserve, through forests of pine were quite beautiful and much more scenic. Nonetheless the topography and flora and fauna also kept changing on this trek, and though we didn't scale the summit, it was money well spent. There are a number of different trails based on difficulty and even though they are well marked with sign boards and a map is also provided, it can still be quite confusing.It might have been an even better experience if we'd arranged for a guide which we didn't since a)there was no guide around, and b)we might have had second thoughts about getting one, given there were doubts about whether all members of the party could complete the full trek.

And it will not create a huge impact on the cleanliness. Let me clear 2 things\n\n1. If you are into a budget trip then it is not a good idea to give money and visit the peak total costing for 1 person ( parking varies ( 60 -150 ) there are certain parking. Entry fee ( 200 person ) extra car ( if you just want to go mount Everest house  100 RS per person per side ) otherwise you can walk. Your first stop will be george mount house then you need to climb 20-30 minutes to reach the peak.\n\n2. The location is worth visiting a place but not worth it to go to in the lap of nature after spending so much money. This location is only valid for those who love sunset and who love peaks, and mountains. If you have more desire then please don't go. Because there is no other thing you find. If you are fond of pictures then you must pay a visit to the Dalai hills. ( Perfect location, 500 meters walking towards the peak ) even Dalai hills is the perfect location for pre-wedding shoots. But don't go George monutain for pre-wedding but you can utilize ( george mountain starting points for perfect lovy dovy pictures ) in the staring point you will found greenery and big tress enhence thier beauty."

This is so because after reaching the starting point of hilly tract, one needs to trek 1.5 km to reach the waterfall. The trek is pleasant, quiet and peaceful. There are no eating joints enroute of near the falls. Well-known boarding schools like Oak Grove School and St. George’s College are located near the Jharipani village."
