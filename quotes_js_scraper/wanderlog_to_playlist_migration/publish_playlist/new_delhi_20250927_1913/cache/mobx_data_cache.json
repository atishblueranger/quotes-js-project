The last time I went was on 15th August 2025 – Independence Day, which made the experience even more memorable. Being at the fort on this day carries a unique sense of pride, as it is not only a historical monument but also the very place where India celebrates its freedom with the Prime Minister’s address and the flag hoisting ceremony.\n\nThe architecture of the fort never fails to impress me – the majestic red sandstone walls, beautifully crafted gates, and intricately designed structures inside reflect the grandeur of the Mughal era. Walking through its corridors feels like stepping back in time and reliving the pages of history.\n\nApart from the monuments and historical significance, the fort also has some nice shops inside where visitors can buy souvenirs. These shops offer handicrafts, miniature replicas, and other items that make for good keepsakes to remember the trip.\n\nOverall, the Red Fort is not just a monument but a living symbol of India’s history and heritage.

Our morning began at Rajghat, and from there we made our way to Jama Masjid.\n\nIt’s one of the largest mosques in India and a true architectural marvel, built centuries ago during the Mughal era. As soon as we arrived, we were swept into the lively energy of Old Delhi—the sounds, the colors, the movement—it’s a kind of chaos that somehow feels alive and exciting rather than overwhelming.\n\nThe climb up the steps to the mosque was a fun adventure for our daughters (5 and 7), who took it on like a challenge and loved every minute. Once we entered the vast open courtyard, everything shifted. The noise faded, and it felt incredibly peaceful and calm inside. There’s something very spiritual about standing there, surrounded by towering minarets, marble domes, and centuries of history.\n\nOur girls were full of curiosity, asking questions about how people pray, what the call to prayer means, and why everyone was barefoot. It turned into a beautiful moment of quiet reflection and learning. We took our time to take it all in, and even in the middle of a bustling city, it felt like we were in our own quiet world.\n\nWe absolutely loved this visit—it was meaningful, memorable, and full of life. Highly recommend for anyone traveling through Delhi, especially with kids who are curious and adventurous 🙏🏽."

The premises and surrounding area were not well maintained, with dirty walkways, open drains emitting unpleasant smells, and a large, unmanaged crowd both inside and outside the mosque, which made moving around difficult and diminished the peacefulness such a place should offer. The nearby market, though vibrant and full of life, felt chaotic and poorly organized, adding to the sense of disorder, and I truly believe it would benefit from proper management, covered drains, and better sanitation. From what I have seen in other people’s accounts, my impressions are widely shared—many visitors praise the sheer beauty and spiritual presence of Jama Masjid but express disappointment about the lack of cleanliness, the overwhelming number of visitors at any given time, and the constant haggling or touting near the entrances. While the breathtaking view from the minaret and the sense of stepping into a living piece of history remain unforgettable highlights, the lack of upkeep and effective crowd control significantly detract from what could otherwise be a truly majestic experience, and for that reason I would rate my visit 3 out of 5."

The vibe of the place is immaculate. With parrots, peacocks and pigeons roaming around on the grounds, it is like an oasis of peace in the chaos of the city.\n\nThe tomb is majestic although crumbling. The entry gate itself is an example of brilliant architecture. The intricate details and designs will leave you craving for more time with those walls.\n\nThe ticket is purchased online. And it remains open till 7 pm, after that they shut it down."

              "reviewText": "Safdarjung Tomb is one of those monuments in Delhi that often gets overshadowed by Humayun’s Tomb or Qutub Minar, but honestly, it deserves equal attention. Located right next to Safdarjung Airport, it’s very easy to reach by metro or road. The entry tickets are affordable (cashless payment options are available), and usually the place is not too crowded, which makes the visit very relaxed.\n\nThe tomb itself is an impressive piece of Mughal architecture, built in 1754. The central dome and red sandstone structure with marble detailing look stunning, especially during early mornings or late afternoons when the sunlight falls beautifully on the arches. The gardens are laid out in the Mughal charbagh style, with symmetrical pathways and water channels, which are perfect for a peaceful walk.\nWhat I liked most is the calm atmosphere here.\n\nUnlike some other crowded monuments in Delhi, Safdarjung Tomb is relatively less crowded, which makes the visit more enjoyable. You can walk leisurely, admire the architectural details, and even sit under the trees to soak in the serenity.  It gives you enough space to appreciate the history and architecture. It’s also a great spot for photography, as the wide lawns, long corridors, and majestic gateways give excellent frames.\n\nFacilities are decent. There are benches around the gardens. The ticket counter staff are polite, and the ASI has maintained the monument well. There is ample free parking. Nearby you can also visit Lodhi Garden or Khan Market for food and coffee after your tour.\n\nOverall, Safdarjung Tomb is a hidden gem in Delhi’s heritage trail. If you are looking for history, architecture, or just a peaceful place to unwind in the middle of the city, this is a perfect spot. Highly recommended for both tourists and locals."

Visiting it feels like stepping back in time to when astronomical observations were made without modern technology, yet with incredible accuracy. The collection of instruments here—massive sundials, celestial observation tools, and various geometric structures—are not only scientifically important but also visually stunning.

The structures are so precise and carefully designed that they continue to spark curiosity even today. If you’re someone who loves astronomy, history, or architecture, this place is a gem.\n\nThe grounds are well-maintained, though I’d recommend hiring a guide or using the audio guide, as it helps you understand the function of each instrument much better. Without it, the place can just look like a collection of unusual stone structures."

              "reviewText": "Overview\nJantar Mantar in New Delhi is an astronomical observatory built in the 18th century. It is a testament to the scientific and architectural ingenuity of the past, consisting of a collection of colossal masonry instruments used for astronomical observations. It's one of five such observatories built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II of Jaipur, who was a passionate astronomer and a patron of science. While it may not serve its original scientific purpose today due to the surrounding tall buildings, it remains a fascinating historical and architectural site.\nHistorical Significance\nThe Delhi Jantar Mantar was the first of five observatories constructed by Maharaja Jai Singh II between 1724 and 1730, with the others located in Jaipur, Ujjain, Varanasi, and Mathura. He was commissioned by Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah to revise the astronomical tables of the time and improve the accuracy of the calendar. Jai Singh II believed that the smaller, brass instruments used by astronomers were not precise enough, so he built these large, fixed masonry instruments to achieve greater accuracy. The name \"Jantar Mantar\" is derived from Sanskrit, with \"Yantra\" meaning instrument and \"Mantra\" meaning formula or calculation, effectively translating to \"instruments for measuring the harmony of the heavens.\"\nArchitecture and Instruments\nThe architecture of Jantar Mantar is striking, with its geometric, sculpture-like instruments that are both functional and visually impressive. The complex is an open-air observatory with several key instruments, each designed for a specific astronomical purpose.\n* Samrat Yantra: This is the most prominent instrument, a massive triangular sundial (the \"Supreme Instrument\"). It was used to measure time with remarkable accuracy, with a large gnomon (the arm of the sundial) and a curved scale on which the shadow would fall.\n* Mishra Yantra: This \"mixed instrument\" is a combination of five instruments and was used to determine the shortest and longest days of the year. It could also be used to find out the precise time of noon in different cities around the world.\n* Ram Yantra: Two large cylindrical structures with open tops, designed for measuring the altitude and azimuth of celestial bodies.\n* Jai Prakash Yantra: A pair of concave hemispherical sundials used to align the position of stars to markings on the instrument's surface.\nVisitor Experience and Review\nJantar Mantar offers a unique experience for visitors, blending science, history, and art.\n* Atmosphere: The site is a tranquil green space in the middle of a bustling city, offering a peaceful environment for exploration. The instruments themselves have a sculptural quality that is very appealing.\n* Educational Value: For those interested in astronomy and ancient science, the complex is an educational marvel. It provides a tangible glimpse into the scientific knowledge and dedication of 18th-century Indian astronomers. Guides (sometimes available) or informational plaques can help explain the function of each instrument.\n* Photography: The striking shapes and colors of the instruments against the backdrop of the sky make Jantar Mantar a popular spot for photographers.\n* Accessibility: Jantar Mantar is located on Sansad Marg near Connaught Place, making it easily accessible by Delhi Metro (the nearest station is Patel Chowk or Rajiv Chowk). Entry fees are low for Indian citizens and a bit higher for foreigners.\nIn summary, Jantar Mantar is a compelling destination for anyone with an interest in history, science, and unique architecture. While its functionality has been compromised by modern buildings, its historical significance and the sheer brilliance of its design make it a worthwhile visit for a glimpse into India's rich scientific past."

              "reviewText": "Today, I visited the Lotus Temple in Delhi on my own, and although it wasn’t my first time, the experience was still special in its own way. The temple is one of the most iconic landmarks in Delhi, known for its serene ambiance and its breathtaking lotus-shaped architecture.\n\nUnfortunately, just as I arrived, it started raining heavily, which meant I couldn’t actually enter the temple. This was my second attempt at visiting, and yet again, I had to admire it mostly from the outside. Despite that, the overall experience was memorable.\n\nThe Lotus Temple’s design is truly a sight to behold. The white marble petals form a giant lotus, symbolizing purity, peace, and unity. Even from a distance, the temple exudes a sense of calm. Surrounded by lush green gardens, the area feels like a peaceful escape from Delhi’s chaos. Standing there in the light rain, looking at the temple with droplets shimmering on the white marble, was almost meditative.\n\nWhile I couldn’t step inside this time, I still cherish the quietness and the spiritual vibe that the place radiates. I also appreciated how clean and well-maintained the premises are. The sound of rain on the leaves and pathways only made the experience more soothing.\n\nIf I had to sum it up:\n\nPros: Stunning architecture, peaceful surroundings, serene atmosphere\n\nCons: Entry can be restricted during rain, so plan accordingly\n\nEven though I haven’t yet fully explored the temple from the inside, I still find myself drawn to its energy. My love for this place grows with each visit, and I hope that on my third visit, I finally get to sit inside and experience the silence and tranquility that the Lotus Temple is famous for.\n\nRating: ★★★★☆ (4/5, only because I couldn’t enter due to rain!)"

Wheelchair facilities are available, which makes it convenient for elderly visitors and those with mobility challenges.\n\nThe entry process is simple and organized. Uou go through a tight security check, then walk along a beautiful green pathway leading up to the temple. Once inside, the atmosphere is truly peaceful and super silent. The devotional song and preaching echo gently through the dome, creating a serene and calming experience. Sitting there for 10–15 minutes brings a sense of inner peace.\n\nWhat I really appreciated is that it’s a no fuss visit. You enter, spend quiet time in the temple, and then exit through the same walkway without unnecessary delays or commercial distractions.\n\nOverall, I would say the Lotus Temple is a good one time visit and definitely a must see for anyone visiting Delhi. It’s not just about architecture, but also about experiencing the tranquility and spiritual calm the place offers."

As soon as I stepped inside the premises, I was immediately struck by the serene ambiance and the rich cultural heritage that permeated every corner.\n\nThe staff at Tibet House were incredibly warm and welcoming, making me feel right at home. They were knowledgeable and passionate about Tibetan culture, and their enthusiasm was infectious. They guided me through the various exhibits, providing detailed explanations about the artifacts, artworks, and historical relics on display.\n\nThe museum section of Tibet House was an absolute treasure trove of Tibetan history and tradition. The carefully curated collection showcased the remarkable journey of the Tibetan people, their struggles, and their resilience. From ancient manuscripts to intricately woven thangka paintings, each exhibit transported me to a different era, enabling me to gain a deeper understanding of Tibetan Buddhism and its profound influence on Tibetan society.\n\nThe library at Tibet House was a haven for book lovers and researchers alike. It housed an extensive collection of texts, rare manuscripts, and scholarly works on Tibetan philosophy, art, and literature. Spending time in this serene space, surrounded by shelves upon shelves of knowledge, was a true delight.\n\nOne highlight of my visit was attending a cultural event at the auditorium. The performances by Tibetan artists were mesmerizing, showcasing traditional music, dance, and even theater. It was a rare opportunity to witness the vibrant Tibetan arts firsthand and be captivated by the sheer talent and grace of the performers.\n\nThe café at Tibet House was a cozy spot where I could relax and reflect on the profound experience I had just encountered. The menu featured a variety of Tibetan delicacies, allowing me to savor the authentic flavors of Tibet. The momos, in particular, were simply divine and left me craving for more.\n\nOverall, my visit to Tibet House was an immersive and enlightening experience. It is more than just a cultural center; it is a sanctuary that preserves and celebrates the rich heritage of Tibet. Whether you are a history enthusiast, a seeker of spiritual knowledge, or simply curious about different cultures, Tibet House is a must-visit destination in New Delhi. It offers a unique opportunity to connect with the essence of Tibetan culture, and I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a meaningful and transformative experience.\n\nNote: This review is based on my personal experience and reflects my honest opinion of Tibet House, Cultural Centre of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in New Delhi."

The portions were very generous, so I'd advise ordering accordingly! The food definitely lived up to its name – those noodles were seriously spicy!  My eyes and nose were watering (in a good way!), and my ears even turned red.\nThe lemonade seemed pre-made (which might not be to everyone's taste), but it was still refreshing. The coffee also hit the spot - hot and caffeinated, just what I needed."

The fountains, greenery, and perfectly maintained lawns add to the charm. The ambience is calm and refreshing, making it an ideal spot for nature lovers, families, and photography enthusiasts. The arrangements for visitors are well managed, with proper entry, security, and facilities. Visiting during the annual opening season is truly a magical experience — a blend of heritage, beauty, and serenity."

              "reviewText": "I recently got the chance to visit Rashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi all by myself, and it turned out to be one of the most fascinating solo experiences I’ve had. Being the official residence of the President of India, the place already carries a sense of grandeur, but seeing it in person was something else entirely.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the massive scale of the building. Designed by Edwin Lutyens, its architecture blends Indian and European styles beautifully. Walking along the pathways, I couldn’t help but admire the perfectly maintained lawns and the symmetrical structure of the building. The iconic dome stood tall and impressive, making me pause just to take it all in.\n\nI also got to explore the Mughal Gardens (now called Amrit Udyan), which were absolutely stunning. The colorful flowers, fountains, and neatly trimmed hedges made the place feel almost dreamlike. Sitting alone on a bench there gave me a rare moment of calm right in the heart of Delhi.\n\nSince I went alone, I could move at my own pace—reading little details, taking photos, and just observing the surroundings without distraction. Security was understandably tight, but everything was organized well, making the visit smooth.\n\nWhat I liked most was the mix of history, architecture, and serenity that Rashtrapati Bhavan offers. It’s not just a building; it’s a symbol of India’s heritage and democracy. Visiting it solo gave me the chance to truly appreciate its grandeur and peaceful atmosphere."

Perfect for photography lovers — the lighting and backdrop make for stunning pictures.\nSecurity was visible but not intrusive, and crowd management was smooth. It's a great place to take a stroll, enjoy some quiet time, or just soak in the historic significance of the monument.\n\nHighly recommended for both tourists and locals who want to experience a piece of India’s heritage in a calm, scenic setting!"

This stunning, India Gate is a grand war memorial, built to honor all the Indian soldiers who laid their lives in worlds war one and chicago added the gate in the late 1900s. The sight of this stunning Indo-Saracenic style architecture can take one’s breath away especially in the evening.\n\nThere is a lot of activity near the india gate area because it’s an attraction for the local street vendors and tourists. The stunning green lawns make it a favorite spot for rejuvenating strolls, family picnics and even enjoying being out in the nature. Thousands of people visit here for evening and morning walks which makes this place active during both the times. Street hawkers set up stalls selling local treats such as chaat, bhel puri and ice cream which is always really refreshing.\n\nMost of these spots tend to get really busy towards the weekends or the public holidays. If someone decides to come by car or has their own parked nearby, it’s a hassle. Delhi metro makes public transport really easy if you are getting an auto-rickshaw.\n\nIn general, India Gate is more than an attraction, it embodies pride, history, and vocation. If you’re someone who relishes history or a photo enthusiast"

This complex is not only a fine example of early Mughal architecture but also a peaceful and well-maintained heritage place that takes you back in time. Isa Khan Niazi, whose tomb is at the centre of the complex, was a noble in the court of Sher Shah Suri, and his tomb was built in the year 1547, much before Humayun’s Tomb.\nThe tomb is built in Afghan-style architecture and has a unique octagonal shape, surrounded by a lovely garden enclosed within high walls. The detailed stone lattice work (jaali), beautiful arches, and the red and grey sandstone make the structure look very elegant and artistic. Inside, the tomb is simple but peaceful, and the dome above adds to the charm of the structure.\nApart from the main tomb, the complex also has a mosque and remains of other old structures. The mosque has three arches and a large dome, and is also built in traditional Mughal style. What makes this place special is its calm atmosphere, clean surroundings, and greenery. It is a less crowded spot compared to other monuments in Delhi, which makes it a perfect place for visitors who want to explore history peacefully.\nThe Archaeological Survey of India has done a good job in restoring the site and keeping it clean. Overall, the Isa Khan Tomb Complex is a hidden gem for history lovers, architecture students, and tourists who want to see the roots of Mughal design and enjoy some quiet time in a historical setting."

To enter the park, you need to buy a ticket on-site. Inside, you'll find a beautiful tomb, a serene water lake, a cozy café, and a museum that adds depth to the historical significance of the site. The highlight for me was the stunning sunset view!"

Spanning over 200 acres, it’s best suited for those who enjoy walking and exploring.\n\nThe park is home to several notable monuments like Jamali-Kamali Mosque and Tomb, Rajon Ki Baoli, Quli Khan’s Tomb, Café Stoned, and more. There’s an entry fee of ₹50 per person at the Quli Tomb entrance.\n\nThe area is lush with greenery and very peaceful — the only sound you’ll hear is an airplane passing overhead every couple of minutes. From here, you can also enjoy a great view of the Qutub Minar. The place isn’t very crowded, likely because most visitors head straight to Qutub Minar, so you can explore in peace.\n\nIt’s a lovely spot to spend the day with your loved ones, and it’s also kid-friendly. I had a really nice experience here ❤️"

              "reviewText": "I recently explored the Mehrauli Archaeological Park alone, and it turned out to be a wonderful mix of history, peace, and discovery. Spread across a huge area right next to Qutub Minar, the park is filled with ancient monuments, tombs, and ruins that make you feel like you’ve stepped back in time.\n\nWalking in, I was amazed at how quiet and green the place was compared to the busy streets outside. Since I went alone, I could just wander at my own pace, taking random paths and stumbling upon old structures. From the stepwell (Rajon ki Baoli) to historic tombs like Jamali Kamali, every spot had its own charm. The carvings, arches, and weathered stones told silent stories of centuries gone by.\n\nWhat I liked most was the combination of nature and history. Birds, trees, and wide open spaces made it feel more like a peaceful retreat than a typical tourist site. At some places, I was the only one around, which added a sense of calm and gave me time to sit quietly, click pictures, and just imagine how life must have been here hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe park isn’t as crowded as other monuments, so it’s perfect for a solo outing if you want both space and history. Of course, it’s good to carry water and wear comfortable shoes since there’s a lot of walking. Overall, my solo visit to Mehrauli Archaeological Park was refreshing—a hidden gem where Delhi’s history and nature meet beautifully."

              "reviewText": "Fatehpuri Masjid, one of Delhi’s oldest and most revered mosques, was constructed in 1650 by Fatehpuri Begum, a wife of the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan, who also commissioned the Taj Mahal. Named after its founder, Fatehpuri Masjid stands at the western end of the bustling Chandni Chowk, opposite the monumental Red Fort and facing Jama Masjid across the old city. This masjid showcases the intricate Mughal architectural style, specifically with its red sandstone structure, onion-shaped domes, and beautifully arched gateways.\n\nArchitectural Features: Fatehpuri Masjid’s architecture is modest yet impressive, embodying the classic simplicity of Mughal aesthetics. The mosque features a central courtyard surrounded by arched galleries, with three large domes topping the main prayer hall. The walls are adorned with calligraphic inscriptions, and the traditional mihrab (prayer niche) inside the hall is decorated with minimalistic yet elegant carvings. Unlike the Jama Masjid, Fatehpuri Masjid has a single prayer hall, but its architecture allows ample natural light and ventilation, making it a peaceful and inviting space for worship.\n\nHistorical Significance: Fatehpuri Masjid has stood as a silent witness to Delhi’s transformations, from the grandeur of the Mughal era to British colonial rule and post-independence India. After the First War of Indian Independence in 1857, British forces seized the mosque, converting it into a military base and storehouse as part of a larger effort to suppress the city’s Muslim community. Subsequently, the British auctioned it to Rai Lala Chunnamal, a prominent local businessman and one of the few wealthy individuals allowed to remain in the Chandni Chowk area after the uprising.\n\nIn 1877, in recognition of its religious significance and as a goodwill gesture to the Muslim community, the British returned the masjid to its original purpose through negotiations funded by the Nawab of Rampur, a well-known patron of art, culture, and religious institutions.\n\nCultural and Religious Role: Over the centuries, Fatehpuri Masjid has served as an essential spiritual and educational center for the Muslim community in Delhi. The masjid houses a madrasa (Islamic school), which has historically attracted students from all over the region. In addition to regular prayers, the masjid is a gathering point for Friday congregational prayers, Eid celebrations, and other significant religious events. The mosque’s tranquil courtyard provides a place for reflection amidst the surrounding hustle and bustle of Chandni Chowk’s market streets, drawing not only worshippers but also travelers, photographers, and history enthusiasts.\n\nPresent-Day Fatehpuri Masjid: Today, Fatehpuri Masjid remains a well-preserved monument, revered both as a functioning mosque and a historic site. The masjid is managed by the local community, with ongoing efforts to maintain its architectural integrity and spiritual atmosphere. During Ramzan, the masjid comes alive with devotees who gather for iftar and tarawih prayers, creating an atmosphere that resonates with Delhi’s rich Islamic traditions.\n\nVisitors to Fatehpuri Masjid often enjoy its proximity to the cultural heart of Old Delhi. Surrounded by traditional markets, iconic eateries, and centuries-old shops, the masjid is integral to the living heritage of the area. Fatehpuri Masjid stands as both a piece of Mughal history and a testament to the resilience and continuity of Delhi’s Islamic culture, drawing visitors who seek a glimpse into the city’s layered past and its enduring cultural diversity."

Everyone is welcomed here.\nJust remove the footwear at the entry gate and take it with you.\nThe building is very old. The architecture is extremely beautiful. It is a marvel of architectural engineering. Well built. Make you feel good. A good place to go and have some look inside even for general visiting purposes.\nDoing prayer is not mandatory. No one asks you why you are visiting.\nPhotography:-\nJust don't take pictures of people especially women without asking.\nYou can take as much as your and your family or friends photos at any place just away from the main mosque. No one will bother you.\n\nOverall very nice old building.\nIn one word, a mini Jama Masjid but a little better and not crowded with better old building structures."

While it’s not very large—it spans about 60 meters in length and 15 meters in width—the peaceful atmosphere and historical charm make it worth a short visit. Ideal for those interested in heritage sites, though the compact size means the visit can be brief, especially outside busy times when it’s more tranquil."

The stepwell has a unique charm, and the symmetry and stonework make it a peaceful and visually stunning spot right in the heart of Delhi. It's a great place for photography and to get a glimpse of Delhi’s historical heritage.\nHowever, I was disappointed by the cleanliness of the water at the bottom of the baoli,it was quite poor and took away from the overall experience. With a bit more maintenance, this place could be even more spectacular.\nStill, worth a visit if you enjoy history, architecture, or just want a quiet break from the city buzz."

The royal residence had no private place of prayer, and the construction of the mosque beyond its walls was a symbol that the city outside the fort was not deprived of royal patronage.",

              "reviewText": "We approached AKDA with a single constraint/requirement that the cost of construction should  be kept as low as possible since we were on a shoe string budget. We could not even fathom at that time that beautiful yet functional design and cost need not be mutually exclusive. Steve Jobs famously said \"A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.” With AKDA we had the opportunity to experience this first hand.\n\nWhat followed after just a few meetings was a house designed with not just the residents in mind but also the environment. AKDA had managed to give us decent sized bedrooms, a fabulous living space and a green backyard that also made use of the existing tree and added to the charm of the house. With a huge angled glass window in the front, they were also able to utilize the view of the park from our plot. The view of serene greenery and open spaces made us realize that we had not and would not have thought of these as top priority requirements/needs in the house. It was hard to imagine that a simple rectilinear plot of land surrounded by houses on all sides could feel so pleasant, airy and spacious. Put simply, we don’t need a holiday home.\n\nBy managing and executing the construction through their own team, AKDA managed all this while keeping our construction costs within an unheard range of Rs. 1000/sq foot. To top it off, our house has already been featured in some of the top architecture publications around the world. As a home-owner, that gives us the feeling that we own a piece of history and possibly one of the finest houses in the area."

The girl I spoke to couldn't come up with a justified excuse and kept mumbling vain excuses like we do not do projects outside delhi which they clearly do, and we do not do particular plot sizes which again they clearly do. Not sure how many problems I would have had to face just in case I hired them. Unreasonable untrained noob architects."

              "reviewText": "I hired Amit to design a house that I was building for myself. Actually I should rather say that Amit hired himself for the project elbowing me out (I am an architect myself). I guess he wanted to do a design exercise in which he had a design appreciative client, (yours truly) and in which the boundaries could be stretched in pursuit of an idea with a slight disregard to mundane worldly requirements. In fact this could also be an exercise to see if these mundane worldly requirements actually amount to much.\n\nSo, we began the process of design and construction in which he came up with a really unique scheme. We also devised a few new construction methods (shallow excavation ) that proved fruitful. Testament to that is the fact that the building is still standing and due to be occupied very shortly.\n\nTime to talk about Amit. If I could put it very concisely I would say that Amit is someone who does not have to be told to be truthful to his work. He does not cut corners, He is not lazy, He is honest and he is all these things because of his inner drive.\n\nSo in case you hire him you are free of doubt as to the professionalism that he brings. you can be sure that he will do his job with the minimum of fuss and maximum dedication and you will not have to drive him to do it. And that's what you hire professionals for, isn't it?\n\nRajnish Tyagi"

I had heard so much about it and was glad to finally see it in person.\n\nWe left all our belongings—including phones, cameras, and bags—in the car, as absolutely no electronics are allowed inside. The rules are very strict, and there are multiple security checks. While I understand the need for security, the staff at the entry checkpoints came across as quite rude. The pat downs felt unnecessarily rough, which made the start of our visit a bit uncomfortable.\n\nThe structures themselves are breathtaking. The intricate carvings, massive domes, and the scale of the complex are truly impressive. It’s clear that an incredible amount of work and devotion went into creating this space. But it was extremely crowded, and the overwhelming number of people made it hard to enjoy the beauty. At times it felt almost suffocating, especially under the intense afternoon heat.\n\nMy five and seven year old were just not able to take much from the experience. Even though I pointed out the beautiful details and architecture, they were too hot and tired to engage. We had looked forward to exploring the grounds more, but between the crowd and the heat, we had to cut it short.\n\nThere are definitely peaceful corners here—fountains, gardens, and shaded walkways—but overall, the experience felt more hectic than calming. I can see how it could be meaningful on a cooler, quieter day, but for us, it was a bit too much."

The place is very clean and extremely well-maintained, which really enhances the overall experience.\n\nYou do need to buy an entry ticket, but I visited on World Heritage Day, so the entry was free. Normally, tickets can be purchased online or at the counter.\n\nIf you're visiting during summer, I highly recommend carrying a hat, an umbrella, and a bottle of water. It gets quite hot, and there are very few shaded areas to rest. Keep in mind, you won’t find anything to eat or drink inside the monument premises. However, just outside the entrance, there are plenty of eateries, street food stalls, and small shops.\n\nQutub Minar is just about 2 km from the nearest metro station (Qutub Minar Metro Station). Autos are easily available, and they usually charge ₹20 per person for a ride to the monument and the same for the return trip.\n\nOne thing to note—some auto drivers might offer to take you to a nearby shopping center called \"Rajasthan Textile Development Corporation\" by saying there’s no waiting charge. This is because they get commissions based on how long you stay at the shop, so keep that in mind if you're short on time or uninterested in shopping.\n\nOverall, it’s a beautiful place to soak in history, architecture, and calm vibes—just plan well if you're going in the summer!"

I got stunned that this place now looks more beautiful and elegant at night.we drove 2 hours from greater noida and it was worth it. We parked the car nearby and it took us 5 minutes to reach there by walk. The entry was free due to a good Friday holiday so we didn't spend on tickets.security check was there and you can check my pics for the first view of qutub minar. We spent almost 90 minutes. At 8 pm there was a light show which was happening daily(check my post videos). You can carry water with you. There are washrooms nearby. Guards are there. The crowd is very good. You can come via metro and via bus to this place. There are some juice shops and eating joints opposite to qutub. The nearby area is very posh and you will see all the famous designers showrooms."

This sacred space pulsates with an atmosphere of profound peace, prosperity, love, and happiness that is truly captivating. From the moment you step into the bustling lanes leading to the shrine, you are enveloped in a unique cultural experience that touches your soul.\n\nThe air resonates with devotional music (Qawwali), the scent of incense, and the murmur of prayers. It's a place where people from all walks of life, irrespective of their religious beliefs, come together with unwavering faith. Witnessing this unity and devotion is incredibly moving. The architecture, steeped in history, adds to the spiritual ambiance, transporting you to another time.\n\nWhile the overall experience is deeply enriching, it's wise to be mindful of your surroundings. Like any popular religious site, there can be individuals who may try to exploit the faith of visitors through donation scams. It's best to be cautious and avoid engaging with anyone who approaches you with unsolicited offers for Dargah updates or requests for your personal information. Stick to official donation boxes if you wish to contribute.\n\nDespite this minor caution, the Dargah Hazrat Nizamuddin Aulia remains a powerful and uplifting experience. It's a place where you can find solace, witness the beauty of shared faith, and immerse yourself in a vibrant cultural tapestry. Don't miss the opportunity to experience this spiritual heart of Delhi."

He became a disciple of Baba Farid and later his spiritual successor.\n\nHis khanqah in Delhi became a symbol of love, peace, and equality, welcoming people of all faiths. He preached selflessness, unity, and devotion to God, staying away from politics despite the turbulent times. His teachings were carried forward by his beloved disciple Amir Khusrau.\n\nHe passed away in 1325, and his Dargah in Delhi remains a revered spiritual site.

This revered Sufi shrine, dedicated to the 14th-century saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, attracts devotees from all walks of life, as well as tourists drawn to its rich cultural aura. The atmosphere here is truly soulful — the air is filled with the scent of roses and incense, and the rhythmic qawwalis in the evenings evoke a deep sense of peace and devotion.\n\nHowever, the area can be quite crowded, especially during the evenings and on Thursdays. One must be prepared for narrow lanes and a bit of congestion, especially while approaching the main shrine. A major tip for first-time visitors: do not take off your shoes right at the beginning of the lane. There are shopkeepers who might coax you to leave your footwear early, far from the actual entrance. Instead, walk closer to the Dargah — there is a dedicated shop very near the main gate where you can safely and conveniently leave your shoes.\n\nThe site offers a mix of architectural beauty and spiritual calm, with intricately designed marble domes, carved pillars, and gold embellishments adding to its charm. While it may lack the modern amenities of more commercialized religious sites, the authenticity and devotion here are unmatched. Whether you're seeking blessings, cultural exploration, or peace of mind, Nizamuddin Dargah offers an experience that lingers long after you leave."

If you're seeking inner peace and a deep sense of calm, this is a must-visit place.\n\nDo keep in mind to dress modestly, as it’s a religious site and should be respected accordingly.\n\nAfter completing the prayer, if you're a non-veg food lover, I highly recommend visiting Hussaini Hotel, which is just a short walk away. The food there is absolutely delicious — full of authentic flavors and worth the wait!\n\nA soulful visit followed by a hearty meal — overall, a memorable experience."

              "reviewText": "Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah, located in the heart of Delhi, is one of the most revered spiritual destinations in India. Dedicated to the great Sufi saint Hazrat Khwaja Nizamuddin Auliya, the dargah is a serene and soulful place that attracts thousands of visitors daily, regardless of religion or background.\n\nWalking through the narrow, lively lanes toward the dargah, you're immediately immersed in an atmosphere filled with devotion—floral vendors, incense, and the soft echo of qawwali music. The dargah itself is beautifully built in Indo-Islamic style, with white marble, intricate carvings, and a calming courtyard.\n\nOne of the most captivating experiences here is the live qawwali performance held every Thursday evening. The soulful Sufi music sung in devotion truly elevates the spiritual energy of the place. Many people visit to offer prayers, tie threads for wishes, or simply sit in quiet reflection.\n\nDespite the crowds, the sanctity of the dargah remains untouched. It's a peaceful escape from the chaos of the city. Whether you're spiritual, religious, or simply curious about Delhi’s culture, a visit to Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah is a deeply enriching and unforgettable experience.\n\nHighly recommended for a taste of Delhi’s spiritual soul."

This palace is a religious palace, it is a dargah of Khawaja ji. This palace welcomes all religions without any restrictions. Many peoples come here for prayer 🙏 or visit. This palace is not so big. Here you will see some qwwaals singing qwaalies. Peoples doing pray. Dargah has two entry gates. You may find Free food here (as langar). There is a mosque inside the dargah too. You can read islamic books Thier and if you want books for free you can take them.\nThere are too many hotels near dargah but please beware of scams. Put your shoes and slippers inside your bag 🛍️ and don't leave anywhere (peoples offering there for leaving shoes for free but they ask for money later) and also beware of scam of chadar and sheerni.\nDargah closes after 11 in night and opens near 5 in the morning. There is no toilet for common peoples here , a public toilet is nearby but that one closes in the evening and opens in the morning. I will suggest you to stay in a hotel (according to your budget.) You cannot spend the night in dargah for sleeping (this is a rule after corona covid 19 time).. there are so many places to visit nearby as like tomb of Humayun and many more.\n\nNearest metro station and railway station: nijamuddin sarai kale khan 🚇 and hajrat nijamuddin railway station 🚉\n\nKindly choose auto wisely, auto charges may be 50 to 150 now (2025)."

Open 7 AM–5 PM, entry is INR 20 for Indians, INR 200–250 for foreigners. Easily reachable via Tughlaqabad Metro Station, it’s a captivating, slightly haunting glimpse into Delhi’s past.

I took a private bus for ₹10 that dropped me off at okhla mod(turn) 2.5kms away from where i took an auto for 60₹ to reach the fort.\nthere are a lot of monkeys tho you can ask guards to chase them away for you.\nWhile returning there were hardly any auto in sight, asked for ₹100 to metro. i took a public bus (717b) from bus stop to reach badarpur border metro that took like almost an hour to reach and i didnt get any seat(maybe because it was school timing)."

Built by Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq in the 14th century, the fort's imposing walls and remnants of a once-grand city offer a powerful sense of history. It's a great spot for a peaceful walk, away from the usual chaos of Delhi's more popular monuments. You can spend a good amount of time exploring the vast, sprawling ruins and imagining what the city might have been like in its prime. The views from the top are also quite good, providing a nice panoramic of the surrounding area.\n​However, the experience is decidedly \"average\" due to its current condition. Much of the fort is in ruins, and not in a well-preserved way."

              "reviewText": "Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Tughlakabad Fort in New Delhi, and it turned out to be an unforgettable experience that blended history, architecture, and a sense of timeless grandeur.\n\nBuilt in 1321 by Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq, the founder of the Tughlaq dynasty, this fort was envisioned as a stronghold against Mongol invasions. It served both as a fortress and a city, showcasing the ruler’s ambition and military foresight.\n\nThe fort is spread across a massive area, once boasting thick stone walls, massive bastions, and a complex layout that made it nearly impenetrable. Even today, despite being in ruins, the sheer scale and strength of the structure left me in awe.\n\nOne fascinating aspect of Tughlakabad’s history is the curse associated with Saint Nizamuddin Auliya, who allegedly cursed the fort saying \"Ya rahe ujjar, ya basey gujjar\" (\"It will remain deserted or be inhabited by shepherds\"). Walking through the ruins, I could feel the eerie, mysterious aura that still lingers.\n\nI was particularly impressed by the monumental gateways, stone corridors, and the remnants of the royal palace and secret passages. Every corner seemed to whisper tales of battles, betrayals, and royal grandeur.\n\nAnother highlight of my visit was seeing the Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq’s Tomb, connected to the main fort via a causeway. The tomb, surrounded by gardens, is a beautiful example of Indo-Islamic architecture.\n\nThe fort's elevated position gave me panoramic views of the surrounding landscape, and I could easily imagine how this strategic location offered advantages for defense centuries ago.\n\nThe experience was a mix of admiration for the architectural brilliance and reflection on how time slowly reclaims even the mightiest of human creations.\n\nI would recommend wearing comfortable shoes, carrying water, and being ready to explore for a few hours, as the fort complex is vast and rugged.\n\nOverall, visiting Tughlakabad Fort was like taking a step back into the 14th century. It deepened my appreciation for Delhi’s layered history and the incredible stories hidden within its ancient walls."

But the place is well planned and proper guidance.\n\nI was at the Embassy, I had carried my Laptop as wel due to the inconvenience caused during my OFC appointment where the DS160 had expired as it's valid for 1 year only from the date of submission. Though the embassy should intimate in advance to renew / update the DS160, as they send reminder for the appointment. Though a bit of inconvenience was caused due to miscommunication but still was able to finish it in time.\n\nThey have counters for submission of mobile and laptop, which is charged a feasible amount, Rs.100 for Laptop and Rs.50 for mobile. Though they don't take the laptop bag, hence there is a seperate vendor to keep the bags. Though everything went off smoothly.\n\nIt was an overall great experience.

The objective of the excavation was to know the ancient history and archaeological remains of Purana Qila. This Museum is situated on the right side of the main entrance gate (Western Darwaza) of the Purana Qila. On the basis of archaeological relics retrieved at the site, it appears that the ancient site of Purana Qila flourished from the Mauryan period to the Early Mughal Period (3rd Century BCE to 16th Century CE). It is believed that there was a distinct settlement of Painted Grey Ware culture dated to circa 1000 BCE since this type of ware has been collected at the site from unstratified levels. The site is also known as Indraprastha. The Epic Mahabharata mentions the name of Indraprastha (Indarpat) as a capital of the Pandavas. Besides the antiquities collected from excavation, the important objects found from Delhi and NCR (National Capital Region) are also put up on display in this Museum."

It is said to protect the relics of the city of Indraprastha built by the Pandavas about 5,000 years ago. Constructed by the Mughal emperor, Humayun it is a manifestation of the grandeur of the Mughal art. Humayun Darwaza, Bara Darwaza, and Talaqi Darwaza are the three majestic gates built with red sandstone. Entry was restricted through the Talaqi Darwaza as the name Talaqi means ‘forbidden'. The other two attractions at the fort site are Qila-I-Kuhna Mosque and Sher Mandal. Moreover, Qila-i-Kuhna is a domed mosque with pointed arches and five doorways. With the combination of white marble and red sandstone, the mosque looks amazing. Sher Mandal is a double storey tower and it is said that Humayun died after he fell from the second floor of this tower. Also, there is a museum inside the Purana Qila complex that conserves and exhibits the various artifacts dated back to 1400 A.D. In the past, the fort has served as the place for several plays and cultural events like music and dance shows. One can enjoy a boat ride in the Purana Qila Lake, especially during day-time in winters. In the evening, a light and sound show is held that highlights the various stories connected with Delhi’s past and fort’s history."

Inside this museum, you get to see many types of old objects that are related to the kings and the fort.\n(Brief History of Museum )\nArchaeological Museum, Purana Qila was established in 1973, the main purpose of which was to display the archaeological remains obtained from the archaeological excavations conducted from 1969 to 1973 on the Purana Qila mound. This excavation was done with the aim of knowing the ancient history of the fort and the archaeological remains here. This museum is located on the right side of the main entrance (Western Gate) of Purana Qila. On the basis of the archaeological remains obtained from the excavations, there is evidence of continuous settlement from this site from the Mauryan period to the early Mughal period (3rd century BC to 16th century AD). It is estimated that there must have been an ancient culture here around 1000 BC, in which painted grey pottery must have been used, since such pottery has been obtained from unlevel deposits here. This site is also known as Indraprastha Sthal.  It is mentioned in the Mahabharata epic as Indraprastha, the capital of the Pandavas. Apart from the archaeological remains obtained from excavations, important objects obtained from Delhi and the National Capital Region have also been displayed in this museum."

The fort is largely in ruins, with remnants of its past grandeur still visible. While the palace itself has deteriorated over time, the karagar jail remains relatively intact, showcasing its stronger construction.\n\nThings to consider before visiting\n- Not ideal in summer The fort is not recommended during peak summer due to the intense heat, as there is limited shade apart from a few large trees.\n- Green spaces The big trees in the area provide a cooler breeze, making it a decent spot to relax.\n- Closed well There is a well within the premises, but it is closed off to visitors.\n- Casual hangout spot Instead of treating it as a must-visit historical site, it can be enjoyed as a park-like space where you can sit under the trees and have discussions with friends.\n- Nearby attractions The fort is close to Arun Jaitley Stadium, making it accessible for those exploring the area.\n\nWhile the fort may not be a top tourist attraction, it offers a peaceful environment for those looking to unwind amidst history. If you're in the area, it can be a good spot for a casual visit, but not a mandatory stop on a Delhi itinerary.\nHope this helps."

While the fort holds significant historical value, most of the structure remains in ruins. Unlike other heritage spots in Delhi, the number of visitors here is surprisingly low, which creates a quiet, almost eerie atmosphere. It’s ideal for those interested in history and lesser-known places. However, due to its deserted nature, it’s recommended to visit during the day and preferably with company. Worth a short visit for curious minds and history buffs."

Established in 1961, it has consistently been ranked among the top engineering colleges in the country and is known for its high academic standards, cutting-edge research, and strong industry connections.\n\n- Located in Hauz Khas, South Delhi, the campus spans over 320 acres and includes state-of-the-art facilities, hostels, and recreational areas.\n- IIT Delhi offers undergraduate, postgraduate, and doctoral programs in various fields of engineering, technology, and sciences. It also has interdisciplinary programs and management studies.\n- The institute is renowned for its research output and has numerous research centers and labs. It collaborates with industries and other academic institutions globally.\n\n- The institute encourages innovation and entrepreneurship through its various incubation centers and initiatives like the Foundation for Innovation and Technology Transfer (FITT).\n\nGetting admission here is a dream for millions in India, but only a select few achieve it. I envy those top achievers who make it. I finally visited IIT Delhi for some technical training sponsored by my work organization. The professors are highly knowledgeable and teach exceptionally well.\n\nVisitor parking is available only in the designated Visitor Parking area, which is about 1 km away from the LHC or seminar halls. The entry process is well managed, and the campus is very clean."

I recently visited and was impressed by how green, well-maintained, and peaceful the entire area is. The academic buildings are modern, and the atmosphere is filled with energy and intellect.\n\nEntrance & Timings:\nFor visitors, the main entry is usually through the IIT Gate on Hauz Khas side. Security is strict, so carry a valid ID. Entry is allowed mainly during working hours (9 AM to 5 PM), and you may need a prior appointment or purpose of visit—especially on weekdays. Visitors to hostels or specific departments should coordinate with students or faculty beforehand.\n\nCampus Vibe:\nLots of students cycling or walking around, and you’ll find cafes, libraries, hostels, and research centers spread across the campus. It's well-organized and clean. The atmosphere feels very academic and inspiring.\n\nNearby Access:\nThe campus is well-connected with the IIT Delhi metro station just outside the main gate. Auto and rickshaw availability is good too.\n\nTip for First-Time Visitors:\nIf you’re visiting for admission, exams, events, or just exploring, check your gate entry permissions in advance. Carry a government ID and check the department location online beforehand—it saves a lot of time.\n\nOverall, IIT Delhi offers an elite experience even just as a visitor. You can truly feel the legacy and brilliance of the place the moment you step in."

It is located at the Qutb Minar complex, Delhi, in India and was built by Ali himself during the reign of Mughal emperor Humayun, long after the original monuments of the complex were constructed.\n\nTomb of Imam Zamin\n\nTomb of Imam Zamin\n\nLocationQutb Minar complex, Delhi, India\n\nBuilt1538\n\nUNESCO World Heritage Site\n\nTypeCulturalCriteriaivDesignated1993 (17th session)Part ofQutb Minar and its monumentsRegionIndia\n\nBackground\n\nImam Zamin was a direct descendant of Muhammad  and his original name was Muhammad Ali. Zamin was thus a Sayyid and belonged to the Chishti sect of Sufism. It is believed that he migrated from Turkestan to Delhi during the reign of Sultan Sikandar Lodi, and subsequently became the Imam(chief priest) of the Quwwat-ul-Islam mosque, at the Qutb Minar complex.\n\nAccording to the inscription on the entrance, the mausoleum was built by Zamin between 1537 and 1538 during the reign of Humayun. He died in 1539.Located east of the Alai Darwaza, the tomb was constructed long after the original group of monuments and was the last addition to the Qutb Minar complex. Zamin is buried at the centre of the mausoleum.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe tomb is built in the Lodhi architectural style. The mausoleum is square in shape and measures 7.3 metres (24 ft) in both length and breadth. The roof is supported by twelve pillars and is surmounted by a sandstone dome with jalis  on all the sides, except the west and south. The dome rises from an octagonal drum and is decorated with a marble panel above the chhajja(overhanging eaves or cover of a roof) along with a double row of crenelles. Marble is extensively used for the interior ornamentation and in the construction of the cenotaph. The western side of the mausoleum contains a marble-wrought Mihrab  (niche in the wall of a mosque that indicates the direction towards which the Muslims pray). The entrance, located at the southern side, is also made of marble.\n\nThe entire sandstone structure was originally covered by polished stucco, a portion of which is still extant. The name of Zamin is written in the Naskh script over the doorway of the entrance.\n\nGreat place ❤❤❤❤"

              "reviewText": "Zafar Mahal is last monumental structure built as a summer palace during the fading years of the Mughal era. The building has two parts-The palace which was built first by Akbar Shah II in the 18th century, and the entrance gate called Hathi gate that was reconstructed in the 19th century by Bahadur Shah Zafar II. Bahadur Shah Zafar wished to be buried in the precincts of the Zafar Mahal but was deported by the British to Rangoon, after the First War of Indian Independence in 1857, where he died of old age.\n\nA masjid called the Moti Masjid built by Bahadur Shah I was a private mosque of the royal family, which has now become part of the palace compound. The mosque is a small and unique three-domed structure made of white marble. The austere mosque has the mihrab on the west direction of prayer but is unusually not embellished, except for little border of floral carving on the south at the top edge of a dado\n\nHathi gate is so called because a full decorated elephant with the howdah could pass through it. An inscription on the main arch credits building of the gate by Bahadur Shah II in the eleventh year of his accession as Emperor in 1847-48 AD. A broad Chhajja built in the Mughal style is a striking feature of the arch. At the entrance gate, there are small projecting windows flanked by curved and covered Bengali domes. On both sides of the arch, two ornate medallions in the form of large lotuses have been provided. The gateway also depicts a classic tripolia or three-arch opening."

The place, full of history, is not cared for.\nBuilt in the early 19th century, considered the last monumental structure of the Mughal era.\nThis Resting Palace Served as a summer palace, particularly during the \"Phoolwaalon ki sair\" festival celebrating Sufi saint Hazrat Qutubuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki (whose tomb is also next to this Palace) and this palace witness to the waning years of the Mughal dynasty, mirroring the empire's declining financial resources in its simpler construction compared to other grand Mughal palaces.\n\nUpon arrival i noticed, There's only one guard around, who seemed to be there merely for formality. The lack of care and proper security results in the almost vandalised condition of the site. It's was disheartening to see such a significant historic monument being neglected in this manner.\n\nFurthermore, instead of visitors paying their respects, I observed a group of elderly people playing cards near the premises. This disrespect towards the monument is a reflection of the lack of maintenance and oversight.\n\nBahadur Shah Zafar's empty grave at Zafar Mahal tells a poignant tale of his fate and the decline of the Mughal Empire. It's a powerful reminder of history's twists and turns, left unnoticed amidst the neglect. As Zafar himself wrote,\n\n\"کتنا ہے بد نصیب ظفرؔ دفن کے لیے\n\nدو گز زمین بھی نہ ملی کوئے یار میں\"\n\n\"kitnā hai bad-nasīb 'zafar' dafn ke liye\ndo gaz zamīn bhī na milī kū-e-yār meñ\"\n\nThis poetic line hints at the tragic irony of his burial, adding depth to the site's significance.\nNearby, Moti Masjid, a beautiful mosque, suffers the same fate. It's a shame for such significant places to be forgotten.\n\nMoti Masjid, located next to Zafar Mahal, is a replica of the one in Agra's Red Fort. It's a gem of architecture, and it aslo suffers the same fate\nThe grand entrance is named as Hathi Gate for its wide design allowing an elephant with a seat (houdah) to pass through.\n\nI hoped the Archaeological Survey of India would do better. They must act to protect and restore Zafar Mahal, the grave, and Moti Masjid. These places deserve respect and care.\n\nDespite its importance, the neglect makes visiting Zafar Mahal less enjoyable. I hope it gets the care it deserves soon.\n\nTimings:\nOpen daily from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM.\nEntry Fees:\nNo fee for visiting Zafar Mahal.\nNearby Metro Station- Qutub Minar"

He had only built the Gate 'Hathi Darwaza' big enough for an elephant's entry. The palace is in ruins now. Its walls are crumbling, and it badly needs a restoration or preservation, but I fear that would happen in the near future, and this palace of historical importance would soon be in ruins.

The main gate (known as Hathi Gate) however, is a later addition by his son, the last Emperor Bahadur Shah II (Zafar), by whose name the palace eventually came to be known.\n\nInside are ruins of whatever is left of the palace as most of it is now encroached; a couple of graves spread across towards the left side; Moti Masjid, a Mosque that was commissioned in the early 18th century by Aurangzeb Alamgir's son, the 7th Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah I aka Shah Alam I for private use of the royal family; adjacent to which is a marble enclosure within which are 4 graves and space for a 5th. 3 of these graves are of Emperors, namely Bahadur Shah I (who had Moti Masjid commissioned), Shah Alam II, and Akbar II (who commissioned the palace). 1 grave that is a bit distant from all, towards the corner, is said to be of Mirza Fath-ul-Mulk Bahadur, the last Crown Prince of the Mughal Empire. There is also a noticeable empty plot of land. This is where the last Mughal Emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar wished to be buried but this wish was not fulfilled as he was exiled to Burma where he died and was buried with great secrecy.\n\nDefinitely a great place to visit if you want to see and experience some of the last few mughal constructions ever commissioned up-close. Barely any people visit, those who do are mostly students or guided tours, and even those are rare. There's a security guard who can usually be found inside."

I immediately fell in love with the place and the vibe it resonates. I found the place meticulously handled and maintained. They have a good system for taking and addressing the enquiries.\nThey have a Library with array of Books and Novels in English Language. I loved the space it provided and the crowd that it attracts. You have to have the membership of the British Council Library to have access to it and to have space to read and or study. Not only this, if you have the membership, you get the whole wide space to have your study or even work with your laptops i.e. you are not restricted just to the library to read/study or work. I loved this arrangement and eagerly want to start the membership.\nBritish Council provides many courses in English Language including CELTA, Business English etc.\n\nMust visit and have a beautiful experience:)"

On our first visit (2nd August), we were assisted by a very kind and professional lady who explained everything in great detail and made us feel truly welcomed. We left fully convinced to join.\n\nHowever, when we visited again the next day (3rd August) to complete the admission and clarify a few more queries, our experience was completely opposite. The person sitting at the front desk behaved very rudely and was extremely unprofessional. He didn’t respond to our questions politely and dismissed everything we had been told earlier, without any patience or courtesy.\n\nWe were very disappointed. We have always respected the British Council as a reputed institution, but this kind of behavior—especially from someone representing the organization at the reception—is not acceptable. It left us feeling unwelcome and unsure about joining.\n\nThis feedback comes from a place of genuine disappointment, not anger. I hope the British Council takes this seriously and ensures a more respectful environment for visitors."

Master certification courses for English post which you can teach and prepare students for IELTS.\n\nThe menu is not much . Simple limited items like tea, coffee, sandwiches, burger, a bit of bakery items, croissant etc. it’s spacious though. Quiet place. Neat and clean. Masala tea is for 95 Rs. It was average. High priced as compared.\nLibrary is on the 1st floor. Other inquiries can be made from the staff seated there ."

Thought I was becoming a member of a library but to my woe found out that this is now more of the ubiquitous \"coaching centres\" than an actual library.\nMore than half of the book shelves have been shelved in favour of seating for those who need \"coaching\". Almost all of them are rote learning the management books and books required for IELTS. The entire fabulous DVD and media section has disappeared too.\nWhat astounds me most is the concept of an educational institution like the British Council lying/misrepresenting facts. While it clearly states on the British Council website that upon becoming a member, one can access DVD's, the entire section has been removed.\nSuch is the lack of decorum at the British Council library/coaching centre, that the so called students hog all the seats while browsing content on their smartphones and extend their legs and belongings in such a manner that I was unable to browse the books on the shelves. No manners!"

This stunning, India Gate is a grand war memorial, built to honor all the Indian soldiers who laid their lives in worlds war one and chicago added the gate in the late 1900s. The sight of this stunning Indo-Saracenic style architecture can take one’s breath away especially in the evening.\n\nThere is a lot of activity near the india gate area because it’s an attraction for the local street vendors and tourists. The stunning green lawns make it a favorite spot for rejuvenating strolls, family picnics and even enjoying being out in the nature. Thousands of people visit here for evening and morning walks which makes this place active during both the times. Street hawkers set up stalls selling local treats such as chaat, bhel puri and ice cream which is always really refreshing.\n\nMost of these spots tend to get really busy towards the weekends or the public holidays. If someone decides to come by car or has their own parked nearby, it’s a hassle. Delhi metro makes public transport really easy if you are getting an auto-rickshaw.\n\nIn general, India Gate is more than an attraction, it embodies pride, history, and vocation. If you’re someone who relishes history or a photo enthusiast"

While it’s not very large—it spans about 60 meters in length and 15 meters in width—the peaceful atmosphere and historical charm make it worth a short visit. Ideal for those interested in heritage sites, though the compact size means the visit can be brief, especially outside busy times when it’s more tranquil."

The stepwell has a unique charm, and the symmetry and stonework make it a peaceful and visually stunning spot right in the heart of Delhi. It's a great place for photography and to get a glimpse of Delhi’s historical heritage.\nHowever, I was disappointed by the cleanliness of the water at the bottom of the baoli,it was quite poor and took away from the overall experience. With a bit more maintenance, this place could be even more spectacular.\nStill, worth a visit if you enjoy history, architecture, or just want a quiet break from the city buzz."

Our morning began at Rajghat, and from there we made our way to Jama Masjid.\n\nIt’s one of the largest mosques in India and a true architectural marvel, built centuries ago during the Mughal era. As soon as we arrived, we were swept into the lively energy of Old Delhi—the sounds, the colors, the movement—it’s a kind of chaos that somehow feels alive and exciting rather than overwhelming.\n\nThe climb up the steps to the mosque was a fun adventure for our daughters (5 and 7), who took it on like a challenge and loved every minute. Once we entered the vast open courtyard, everything shifted. The noise faded, and it felt incredibly peaceful and calm inside. There’s something very spiritual about standing there, surrounded by towering minarets, marble domes, and centuries of history.\n\nOur girls were full of curiosity, asking questions about how people pray, what the call to prayer means, and why everyone was barefoot. It turned into a beautiful moment of quiet reflection and learning. We took our time to take it all in, and even in the middle of a bustling city, it felt like we were in our own quiet world.\n\nWe absolutely loved this visit—it was meaningful, memorable, and full of life. Highly recommend for anyone traveling through Delhi, especially with kids who are curious and adventurous 🙏🏽."

The premises and surrounding area were not well maintained, with dirty walkways, open drains emitting unpleasant smells, and a large, unmanaged crowd both inside and outside the mosque, which made moving around difficult and diminished the peacefulness such a place should offer. The nearby market, though vibrant and full of life, felt chaotic and poorly organized, adding to the sense of disorder, and I truly believe it would benefit from proper management, covered drains, and better sanitation. From what I have seen in other people’s accounts, my impressions are widely shared—many visitors praise the sheer beauty and spiritual presence of Jama Masjid but express disappointment about the lack of cleanliness, the overwhelming number of visitors at any given time, and the constant haggling or touting near the entrances. While the breathtaking view from the minaret and the sense of stepping into a living piece of history remain unforgettable highlights, the lack of upkeep and effective crowd control significantly detract from what could otherwise be a truly majestic experience, and for that reason I would rate my visit 3 out of 5."

The gardens around the temple are very well maintained and add to the beauty of the place.\n\nEntry is free, but it’s best to visit early in the morning or in the evening to avoid the heavy crowds and heat.

The temple is one of the most iconic landmarks in Delhi, known for its serene ambiance and its breathtaking lotus-shaped architecture.\n\nUnfortunately, just as I arrived, it started raining heavily, which meant I couldn’t actually enter the temple. This was my second attempt at visiting, and yet again, I had to admire it mostly from the outside. Despite that, the overall experience was memorable.\n\nThe Lotus Temple’s design is truly a sight to behold. The white marble petals form a giant lotus, symbolizing purity, peace, and unity. Even from a distance, the temple exudes a sense of calm. Surrounded by lush green gardens, the area feels like a peaceful escape from Delhi’s chaos. Standing there in the light rain, looking at the temple with droplets shimmering on the white marble, was almost meditative.\n\nWhile I couldn’t step inside this time, I still cherish the quietness and the spiritual vibe that the place radiates. I also appreciated how clean and well-maintained the premises are. The sound of rain on the leaves and pathways only made the experience more soothing.\n\nIf I had to sum it up:\n\nPros: Stunning architecture, peaceful surroundings, serene atmosphere\n\nCons: Entry can be restricted during rain, so plan accordingly\n\nEven though I haven’t yet fully explored the temple from the inside, I still find myself drawn to its energy. My love for this place grows with each visit, and I hope that on my third visit, I finally get to sit inside and experience the silence and tranquility that the Lotus Temple is famous for.\n\nRating: ★★★★☆ (4/5, only because I couldn’t enter due to rain!)"

Wheelchair facilities are available, which makes it convenient for elderly visitors and those with mobility challenges.\n\nThe entry process is simple and organized. Uou go through a tight security check, then walk along a beautiful green pathway leading up to the temple. Once inside, the atmosphere is truly peaceful and super silent. The devotional song and preaching echo gently through the dome, creating a serene and calming experience. Sitting there for 10–15 minutes brings a sense of inner peace.\n\nWhat I really appreciated is that it’s a no fuss visit. You enter, spend quiet time in the temple, and then exit through the same walkway without unnecessary delays or commercial distractions.\n\nOverall, I would say the Lotus Temple is a good one time visit and definitely a must see for anyone visiting Delhi. It’s not just about architecture, but also about experiencing the tranquility and spiritual calm the place offers."

I arrived just before sunrise, and watching the first rays of light fall on the majestic red sandstone walls was simply breathtaking. The fort glowed in warm orange hues, and the peaceful atmosphere made it feel like time had slowed down.\n\nThe morning breeze, the quiet surroundings, and the birds chirping added to the beauty of the moment. Walking through the grand gates and exploring the historic structures inside felt like stepping back in time. I could sense the deep history and culture that this place holds.\n\nAfter my visit, I felt calm, inspired, and deeply moved by the heritage of India. The Red Fort is more than just a monument — it's a symbol of strength, beauty, and tradition. A must-visit, especially in the peaceful hours of the morning. Highly recommended!"

The museum inside gives a deep insight into the Mughal era.\nThe evening light and sound show is also worth watching.\nPlease visit early morning or evening to avoid heat and enjoy peaceful vibes.

I recommend including it if you're interested in learning more about India’s heritage. The museums are well-curated and add depth to the visit.\n\nInside the fort, you’ll also find small shops selling souvenirs, snacks, and local crafts, which adds a lively touch to the experience. It can get a bit crowded, especially during weekends and holidays, but the vibe remains enjoyable.\n\nOverall, it's a must-visit if you're in Delhi — both for its historical significance and the experience of exploring one of India’s most iconic landmarks. 🇮🇳"

The last time I went was on 15th August 2025 – Independence Day, which made the experience even more memorable. Being at the fort on this day carries a unique sense of pride, as it is not only a historical monument but also the very place where India celebrates its freedom with the Prime Minister’s address and the flag hoisting ceremony.\n\nThe architecture of the fort never fails to impress me – the majestic red sandstone walls, beautifully crafted gates, and intricately designed structures inside reflect the grandeur of the Mughal era. Walking through its corridors feels like stepping back in time and reliving the pages of history.\n\nApart from the monuments and historical significance, the fort also has some nice shops inside where visitors can buy souvenirs. These shops offer handicrafts, miniature replicas, and other items that make for good keepsakes to remember the trip.\n\nOverall, the Red Fort is not just a monument but a living symbol of India’s history and heritage. Visiting it on Independence Day added an emotional and patriotic dimension to my experience, making it truly unforgettable."

The rain added a poetic charm to the place, with the soft ripples on the river and the misty atmosphere making it feel almost surreal. The sound of the rain blending with the chants and the sight of birds flying low over the water was incredibly peaceful. It’s a perfect spot for photographers, nature lovers, or anyone looking for a quiet moment in the heart of Delhi. Definitely one of the most beautiful and underrated experiences in the city!"

              "reviewText": "Safdarjung Tomb is one of those monuments in Delhi that often gets overshadowed by Humayun’s Tomb or Qutub Minar, but honestly, it deserves equal attention. Located right next to Safdarjung Airport, it’s very easy to reach by metro or road. The entry tickets are affordable (cashless payment options are available), and usually the place is not too crowded, which makes the visit very relaxed.\n\nThe tomb itself is an impressive piece of Mughal architecture, built in 1754. The central dome and red sandstone structure with marble detailing look stunning, especially during early mornings or late afternoons when the sunlight falls beautifully on the arches. The gardens are laid out in the Mughal charbagh style, with symmetrical pathways and water channels, which are perfect for a peaceful walk.\nWhat I liked most is the calm atmosphere here.\n\nUnlike some other crowded monuments in Delhi, Safdarjung Tomb is relatively less crowded, which makes the visit more enjoyable. You can walk leisurely, admire the architectural details, and even sit under the trees to soak in the serenity.  It gives you enough space to appreciate the history and architecture. It’s also a great spot for photography, as the wide lawns, long corridors, and majestic gateways give excellent frames.\n\nFacilities are decent. There are benches around the gardens. The ticket counter staff are polite, and the ASI has maintained the monument well. There is ample free parking. Nearby you can also visit Lodhi Garden or Khan Market for food and coffee after your tour.\n\nOverall, Safdarjung Tomb is a hidden gem in Delhi’s heritage trail. If you are looking for history, architecture, or just a peaceful place to unwind in the middle of the city, this is a perfect spot. Highly recommended for both tourists and locals."

Spread across 90 acres, it offers a perfect blend of serene natural beauty, historical charm, and ecological richness, making it an ideal escape from the chaos of the city.\n\nThe park is designed like a mini-forest, with dense clusters of trees, flowering gardens, water bodies, and heritage monuments scattered throughout. It’s the kind of place where you can walk for hours, enjoy the chirping of birds, spot ducks gliding across the ponds, or simply sit under the shade of old trees. The atmosphere is peaceful and relaxing—perfect for picnics with family, a day out with friends, or even quiet time with a partner. You'll find many couples and families laying out mats or relaxing near the lush lawns.\n\nThe fountains near the central water channel are a favourite hangout spot. Their soft gurgling sound, paired with the open sky and greenery around, creates a calming ambiance. You’ll often see people sitting nearby, reading, sketching, or just enjoying the view.\n\nThere are two eateries inside the premises, offering light meals, snacks, and beverages. The prices are reasonable—around ₹200 per person on average. The food is decent and the seating areas are clean and well-kept."

The entire place is quiet and calm—perfect for those looking to escape the city’s chaos without actually leaving the city.\n\nThe gardens are lush and well-maintained, filled with beautiful flowers, tall trees, and historical monuments that add a charming touch to the surroundings. There are lovely fountains that create a relaxing vibe, and open spaces for outdoor games, yoga, or simply lounging around.\n\nI saw people jogging, walking, playing badminton, and kids enjoying themselves freely. It’s an ideal spot for a morning workout, a peaceful picnic, or just spending some quality time with yourself or loved ones.\n\nHighly recommended if you're looking for a calm, refreshing break in nature right in the middle of Delhi."

The place has been well maintained and showcases her entire life and political journey. There is her dressing room, her prayer room, dining area, drawing room and her office. It also shows the place where Rajiv Gandhi along with Sonia, Rahul and Priyanka used to stay. The path where she was assassinated is not open for public to go through but we can see it from afar. There is no entry fee. One can easily spend an hour here getting all the information. If you are a history lover, then you should definitely visit it."

I was always awestruck at her interviews and speeches. As an admirer, entering her home (now a museum) was like a deep feeling for me. Seeing her photos from childhood to death, I smiled at some, cried at many. It was a great experience to understand their family tree, their strive for our country India and the legacy they leave behind. I had seen a lot of people with emotional face walking through there. Once a while, Indians must visit here to understand the hardships and sacrifices this family made for us."

The structures are so precise and carefully designed that they continue to spark curiosity even today. If you’re someone who loves astronomy, history, or architecture, this place is a gem.\n\nThe grounds are well-maintained, though I’d recommend hiring a guide or using the audio guide, as it helps you understand the function of each instrument much better. Without it, the place can just look like a collection of unusual stone structures."

              "reviewText": "Overview\nJantar Mantar in New Delhi is an astronomical observatory built in the 18th century. It is a testament to the scientific and architectural ingenuity of the past, consisting of a collection of colossal masonry instruments used for astronomical observations. It's one of five such observatories built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh II of Jaipur, who was a passionate astronomer and a patron of science. While it may not serve its original scientific purpose today due to the surrounding tall buildings, it remains a fascinating historical and architectural site.\nHistorical Significance\nThe Delhi Jantar Mantar was the first of five observatories constructed by Maharaja Jai Singh II between 1724 and 1730, with the others located in Jaipur, Ujjain, Varanasi, and Mathura. He was commissioned by Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah to revise the astronomical tables of the time and improve the accuracy of the calendar. Jai Singh II believed that the smaller, brass instruments used by astronomers were not precise enough, so he built these large, fixed masonry instruments to achieve greater accuracy. The name \"Jantar Mantar\" is derived from Sanskrit, with \"Yantra\" meaning instrument and \"Mantra\" meaning formula or calculation, effectively translating to \"instruments for measuring the harmony of the heavens.\"\nArchitecture and Instruments\nThe architecture of Jantar Mantar is striking, with its geometric, sculpture-like instruments that are both functional and visually impressive. The complex is an open-air observatory with several key instruments, each designed for a specific astronomical purpose.\n* Samrat Yantra: This is the most prominent instrument, a massive triangular sundial (the \"Supreme Instrument\"). It was used to measure time with remarkable accuracy, with a large gnomon (the arm of the sundial) and a curved scale on which the shadow would fall.\n* Mishra Yantra: This \"mixed instrument\" is a combination of five instruments and was used to determine the shortest and longest days of the year. It could also be used to find out the precise time of noon in different cities around the world.\n* Ram Yantra: Two large cylindrical structures with open tops, designed for measuring the altitude and azimuth of celestial bodies.\n* Jai Prakash Yantra: A pair of concave hemispherical sundials used to align the position of stars to markings on the instrument's surface.\nVisitor Experience and Review\nJantar Mantar offers a unique experience for visitors, blending science, history, and art.\n* Atmosphere: The site is a tranquil green space in the middle of a bustling city, offering a peaceful environment for exploration. The instruments themselves have a sculptural quality that is very appealing.\n* Educational Value: For those interested in astronomy and ancient science, the complex is an educational marvel. It provides a tangible glimpse into the scientific knowledge and dedication of 18th-century Indian astronomers. Guides (sometimes available) or informational plaques can help explain the function of each instrument.\n* Photography: The striking shapes and colors of the instruments against the backdrop of the sky make Jantar Mantar a popular spot for photographers.\n* Accessibility: Jantar Mantar is located on Sansad Marg near Connaught Place, making it easily accessible by Delhi Metro (the nearest station is Patel Chowk or Rajiv Chowk). Entry fees are low for Indian citizens and a bit higher for foreigners.\nIn summary, Jantar Mantar is a compelling destination for anyone with an interest in history, science, and unique architecture. While its functionality has been compromised by modern buildings, its historical significance and the sheer brilliance of its design make it a worthwhile visit for a glimpse into India's rich scientific past."

These structures, along with others, were meticulously designed to track the sun, moon, and planets.\n​For the modern tourist, Jantar Mantar is more than just a collection of old buildings; it's an immersive experience. The sheer scale and architectural beauty of the instruments are breathtaking. You can walk among these large, geometric forms, marveling at how they were engineered to perform complex calculations. It offers a tangible connection to history and a sense of wonder at the ingenuity of ancient astronomers.\n​Visiting Jantar Mantar provides valuable insights into India's rich scientific heritage. It’s a perfect spot for anyone interested in science, history, or simply looking for a peaceful and visually stunning place to explore. It’s an educational and inspiring journey that highlights the timeless human pursuit of understanding our place in the universe."

It’s peaceful, full of beautiful traditional art, and perfect for a slow stroll. One of the best parts is the pottery section — you can actually try making your own pottery for a small fee, which is super fun!\n\nThere’s also a small theatre where they sometimes show performances or craft-related films. The museum has a canteen if you get hungry, and a few shops where you can buy handmade stuff — great for gifts or souvenirs.\n\nThey’ve got lockers to keep your stuff safe, clean washrooms, and free drinking water too. Overall, it’s a chill spot to spend a few hours, especially if you’re into crafts or just want a break from the usual city chaos"

And I couldn't focus on the details of the museum even I was there for 3 hours. My experience was very good, very very good. I have visited many places in Delhi for the last one and a half years and but this was my best experience so far. The peace of this place won my heart. I reached here at 12 PM and left at 3:00 PM. Despite spending 3 hours here, I could not see the things here closely. I could not even see many crafts properly. I started with crafts. After seeing all the crafts and artifacts, I went for a natural experience. I was mesmerized by what I saw there. Birds that are not commonly seen in many places these days, like parrots, woodpeckers, etc. were also present there. Although there were many other birds present there, seeing the parrot and woodpeckers made my heart very happy because I saw them after about 10 to 15 years. And I don't know how to explain the experience of nature that was happening there, you can only feel it by going there. By going there you will get to know many things about the history of our country. It is a very beautiful place, very beautiful. Those brothers and sisters whose parents are fond of nature should definitely go there. Thank you. Have a nice day 😊."

The small library in the passage way has many books to read and they have a beautiful outdoor and indoor seating along with the courtyard. Must try a Tropical Mango smoothie, cheese loaded nachos and peri peri fries.  Food was definitely refreshing and delicious. One can spend hours if not minutes in this place.

This was quite unique.\n\nWe had pink sauce pasta and hazelnut frappe martini, which to be honest, I only ordered after I got tempted by another fancy frappe drink being served to a customer. It was quite good; I loved it more than the pasta.\n\nIt’s a good place to catch up with people in your lives, solo dates, remote work etc, as long as there’s a seat available. They even have books on display that you can just pick and read.\n\nI would definitely visit again to try out their drinks menu, keep an 👀 out"

The museum has a huge collection of old engines, coaches, and even some rare locomotives that show the history of Indian Railways. It’s quite informative and gives a nostalgic vibe, but the overall experience feels more like a display gallery than an interactive attraction.\n\nFor children, it can be exciting in the beginning because of the mini toy train ride and some outdoor exhibits, but apart from that, there isn’t much in terms of fun or activities. Adults may find it a bit monotonous after walking around for a while, since most things are to “see and read,” not really to “do.” The maintenance in some parts could be better, and the place feels slightly outdated.\n\nIf you are looking for an entertaining day out, this may not be the best choice. However, if your kids are interested in trains or you enjoy railway history, then it’s worth a short visit. Overall, it’s an ok-ok experience — educational for kids, nostalgic for parents, but not something you’d return to again and again."

Ticket prices are lower on weekdays and higher on weekends and government holidays. Currently, only the joy train is operational, and there are limited swings or play areas for kids.\n\nThe museum itself is quite interesting, with plenty to see about the history of Indian Railways how it all began and how far it has come. The canteen has a decent ambience; if you're hungry, you can try the food, but it’s just average in taste. Parking is available at a fee of Rs. 10 per hour, managed by the MCD."

The museum showcases a wide range of trains and its parts and tickets used earlier. Don’t miss the toy train ride. When we went only one ride was functional, that was a little disappointing.\nLastly the food of the cafeteria was too yummy . We ordered Dhosa and we loved it"

Spanning over 200 acres, it’s best suited for those who enjoy walking and exploring.\n\nThe park is home to several notable monuments like Jamali-Kamali Mosque and Tomb, Rajon Ki Baoli, Quli Khan’s Tomb, Café Stoned, and more. There’s an entry fee of ₹50 per person at the Quli Tomb entrance.\n\nThe area is lush with greenery and very peaceful — the only sound you’ll hear is an airplane passing overhead every couple of minutes. From here, you can also enjoy a great view of the Qutub Minar. The place isn’t very crowded, likely because most visitors head straight to Qutub Minar, so you can explore in peace.\n\nIt’s a lovely spot to spend the day with your loved ones, and it’s also kid-friendly. I had a really nice experience here ❤️"

              "reviewText": "I recently explored the Mehrauli Archaeological Park alone, and it turned out to be a wonderful mix of history, peace, and discovery. Spread across a huge area right next to Qutub Minar, the park is filled with ancient monuments, tombs, and ruins that make you feel like you’ve stepped back in time.\n\nWalking in, I was amazed at how quiet and green the place was compared to the busy streets outside. Since I went alone, I could just wander at my own pace, taking random paths and stumbling upon old structures. From the stepwell (Rajon ki Baoli) to historic tombs like Jamali Kamali, every spot had its own charm. The carvings, arches, and weathered stones told silent stories of centuries gone by.\n\nWhat I liked most was the combination of nature and history. Birds, trees, and wide open spaces made it feel more like a peaceful retreat than a typical tourist site. At some places, I was the only one around, which added a sense of calm and gave me time to sit quietly, click pictures, and just imagine how life must have been here hundreds of years ago.\n\nThe park isn’t as crowded as other monuments, so it’s perfect for a solo outing if you want both space and history. Of course, it’s good to carry water and wear comfortable shoes since there’s a lot of walking. Overall, my solo visit to Mehrauli Archaeological Park was refreshing—a hidden gem where Delhi’s history and nature meet beautifully."

              "reviewText": "Hauz Khas Complex, located in South Delhi, India, is a historic site renowned for its architectural significance and vibrant surroundings.​\n\nHistory: The name \"Hauz Khas\" is derived from Persian, where 'Hauz' means \"water tank\" and 'Khas' denotes \"royal,\" translating to \"Royal Tank.\" This reservoir was originally constructed by Alauddin Khilji during his reign from 1296 to 1316 to supply water to the inhabitants of Siri, the second city of Delhi. Later, during Firuz Shah Tughlaq's rule (1351–1388), the tank was desilted, and several significant structures were added around it, including a madrasa (Islamic seminary), a mosque, and Firuz Shah's own tomb. These additions transformed the area into a prominent center for Islamic education and architecture. ​\n\nMonuments and Structures: The complex houses several notable structures:​\n\nMadrasa: An Islamic learning center established by Firuz Shah Tughlaq, showcasing Indo-Islamic architectural styles.​\n\nMosque: A place of worship adjacent to the madrasa, reflecting the architectural aesthetics of the Tughlaq dynasty.​\n\nFiruz Shah's Tomb: The final resting place of Sultan Firuz Shah Tughlaq, centrally located within the complex.​\n\nPavilions and Cenotaphs: Scattered throughout the gardens, these structures add to the historical ambiance of the site.​\n\nChor Minar: Known as the \"Tower of Thieves,\" historically believed to have displayed the heads of executed thieves as a deterrent during the Khilji dynasty. ​\n\nVisiting Hours: The Hauz Khas Complex is open daily from 10:30 AM to 7:00 PM. It is advisable to visit during early morning or late afternoon hours to avoid the midday heat and to experience the site in pleasant lighting conditions. ​\n\nFacilities: Adjacent to the complex is the Deer Park, a well-maintained green space home to spotted deer, peacocks, rabbits, and various bird species. The park offers walking trails, a rose garden, and a duck pond, providing a serene environment for relaxation. Additionally, the surrounding Hauz Khas Village has evolved into a hub for art galleries, boutiques, cafes, and restaurants, blending historical charm with contemporary culture. ​\n\nHow to Reach from New Delhi Railway Station and Indira Gandhi International Airport:\n\nFrom New Delhi Railway Station: Hauz Khas is approximately 12 kilometers away. You can take the Yellow Line of the Delhi Metro from New Delhi Station to Hauz Khas Metro Station. Alternatively, taxis and auto-rickshaws are readily available.​\n\nFrom Indira Gandhi International Airport: The complex is about 16 kilometers from the airport. Travelers can use app-based cab services or airport taxis for a direct journey. For a more economical option, take the Airport Express Line to New Delhi Metro Station, then transfer to the Yellow Line towards Hauz Khas. ​\n\nBest Season to Visit: The ideal time to explore Hauz Khas Complex is during the cooler months, from October to March. During this period, the weather is pleasant, making it comfortable to walk around and fully appreciate the historical and cultural offerings of the area. ​\n\nHauz Khas Complex offers a unique blend of Delhi's rich historical heritage and its dynamic modern culture, making it a must-visit destination for both history enthusiasts and casual travelers."

It indeed serves as a wonderful reminder of Delhi’s rich history.\n\nThe complex traces its origins to the 13th century during the reign of Alauddin Khilji. The term ‘Hauz Khas’ translates to ‘Royal Tank’ in Persian, referring to the large water reservoir built to supply water to the city of Siri. Later, Firoz Shah Tughlaq restored the tank and added significant structures, including a madrasa (Islamic seminary), mosque, and his own tomb .\n\nYou can easily spend more than half a day exploring the different structures, and some areas make great spots for photos. The history is evident here in the madrasa and Firoz Shah’s tomb.\n\nThe serene Hauz Khas lake serves as a wonderful accompaniment to the complex. The complex is open everyday from 10:30am to 7pm.\n\nNearest metro station: Hauz Khas\n\nEntry fees: 20 rupees for Indian Nationals and 250 rupees for foreign tourists"

The crumbling stone walls, ancient domes, and narrow stairways whisper stories of centuries gone by, and I often find myself imagining the lives that once unfolded within them. The view from the top—overlooking the peaceful green waters of the reservoir and the surrounding Deer Park—is especially breathtaking during sunset, when everything is bathed in warm golden light. I love how the fort blends history with serenity; it's a place where I can just sit, reflect, and escape the city without ever really leaving it. Each visit feels personal and grounding, like the fort holds space for my thoughts alongside its history."

              "reviewText": "Today, I had the privilege of visiting Gurudwara Bangla Sahib in Delhi, and the experience was nothing short of beautiful. The moment I stepped into the premises, a sense of calm washed over me. The golden dome glistening in the sunlight, the sacred sarovar (pond) reflecting the sky, and the soft hymns of kirtan created an atmosphere of deep peace and devotion.\n\nOne of the highlights of my visit was partaking in the langar—the community kitchen that serves free meals to everyone, regardless of background, religion, or status. The langar hall was filled with a sense of unity and humility as people from all walks of life sat together in rows to share a simple, yet soul-satisfying meal. The volunteers served with warmth and smiles, and there was a profound beauty in the spirit of seva (selfless service).\n\nThe meal itself was wholesome and comforting—freshly made chapatis, dal, sabzi, and kheer. But beyond the food, it was the feeling of gratitude and togetherness that made it so memorable. Watching people come together, serve, and share in harmony was deeply touching.\n\nAfter the langar, I spent some time near the sarovar, sitting quietly and soaking in the serenity of the place. The soft chants in the background and the sight of devotees engaged in prayer and service left me with a sense of inner peace.\n\nMy visit to Bangla Sahib was not just about sightseeing—it was a spiritual experience. It reminded me of the values of humility, equality, and compassion. I left with a full heart, a calm mind, and a renewed appreciation for the power of community and faith."

It’s most popular among couples looking for privacy and peaceful surroundings. The inner areas of the garden are mostly occupied by couples, and you’ll find very few families or groups there. Families that do visit usually stay near the outer lawns or picnic areas, unaware of the deeper sections. For solo visitors, the garden is great if you're looking for greenery, silence, or a nature walk. The place is well-maintained and entry is affordable. Just know in advance — this is more of a couple-friendly spot than a typical family park."

However, please note: this garden is primarily a popular hangout spot for couples. Almost every corner has couples spending private moments, which might make it uncomfortable for families or solo visitors looking for a quiet stroll.\n\n🎟 Ticketing:\nThere is no online booking facility – tickets are sold only at the gate and strictly by cash. Entry fee is ₹35 per person. Be sure to carry exact change, especially ₹5 coins or notes, as the staff often refuse to give smaller denominations and may ask you to bring change yourself.\n\n✅ Pros:\n\nBeautiful, green, and well-maintained\n\nGreat for photography and nature walks\n\nCalm atmosphere if you're visiting as a couple\n\n❌ Cons:\n\nNot suitable for family outings\n\nPublic display of affection is common\n\nNo digital payment or online booking"

              "reviewText": "Garden of Five Senses – A Relaxing Escape or… a Couple’s Romance Park? 🌿💔\n\nI recently visited the Garden of Five Senses, a beautifully landscaped park designed to stimulate all five senses. It offers a refreshing break from Delhi’s chaos with its flowers, sculptures, and water features.\n\n🌷 Ambience & Design\nThe garden is peaceful with lovely walking paths, flowerbeds, and art installations. It’s spacious and well maintained, great for a quiet stroll or photography.\n\n🌿 What I Loved\nVariety of plants and fragrant flowers\n\nSeveral sensory zones that engage sight, smell, and touch\n\nPlenty of open space so it rarely feels crowded\n\nGood for nature lovers and casual picnics\n\n⚠️ But Here’s the Catch…\nThis place felt more like a “Couple’s Romance Park” than a family-friendly outing spot. I found multiple couples hiding in bushes and secluded spots. If you’re planning a family hangout or a casual date, this might not be the best choice unless you’re comfortable with that vibe. It feels more like a spot for college couples looking for privacy because they don’t have room elsewhere for romance.\n\n🧾 Other Notes:\nEntry fee is minimal (₹30-50)\n\nLimited shade in some areas, so carry sun protection in summer\n\nFood options inside are basic; better to carry your own snacks\n\nParking can get full, come early if possible\n\n⭐ Final Thoughts: 3.8/5\nIf you want a quiet green retreat and don’t mind the couple-centric atmosphere, this park can be refreshing. But if you’re visiting with family or looking for a peaceful date spot, be aware of the vibe. The name should honestly be changed to “Couples Romance Park” given what I saw!"

So no it's not accessible, food stalls inside are pricey and not worth eating. We all had a stomach issue after eating the chaat and pani poori. But pictures and the views are pretty that's why given 3 stars. If they improve the overall experience of the people visiting with facilities it would be the best park. Tickets are 30rs only but if you want to make vlog then camera charges are between 1000 to 1500rs which is way to expensive 🫰. Also they don't have a locker room so you will have to leave your things at the gate itself. Staff is rude and not so cooperative.\nWheelchair ♿ accessible - yes at some places\nWashroom - No\nSlippery - Yes\nProper resturants - No"

The moment you step through the gates, the chaotic noise of the city fades away, replaced by the calming sounds of kirtan (devotional music) echoing through the air. The golden dome glistening under the sky and the peaceful Sarovar (holy pond) create a deeply tranquil atmosphere that touches your soul.\n\nThe entire premises are immaculately maintained by devoted volunteers. One of the most humbling experiences is sitting in the Langar Hall, where a free, delicious vegetarian meal is served to all, regardless of caste, creed, or background. It’s a true example of humanity, equality, and service.\n\nI was especially moved by the kindness and discipline of the sewadars (volunteers). From guiding visitors to helping with the head covers and offering water and food, their dedication is inspiring. The museum and the library within the complex are also worth a visit for those interested in Sikh history and values.\n\nWhether you're religious or not, a visit to Gurudwara Bangla Sahib will leave you feeling calm, grateful, and more connected. Highly recommended for locals and tourists alike."

Watching the hardworking volunteers tirelessly chop vegetables, cook, serve and clean is moving to say the least. Dip your feet in the sarovar and the rest of the world gets blindsided by the quiet charm of the Gurudwara.\n\nIn the night, this Gurudwara serves a different purpose. All the prayers from the bangla combined with the splashes from the sarovar can be heard clearly. The marble monument gets illuminated and the water reflects all the night lights. For hours, one can sit without overthinking and relax.\n\nPeople come here for many different reasons, but everyone is bound to get at least a little bit tired. All of this Islam and serenity, along with you are bound to feel at least just a bit weary at one time, and Bangla will take care of you at that moment.\n\nRather, it contributes to the sensation that you are entering into something larger than yourself. Your reasons of faith, curiosity, or simply wanting to take a moment of silence will ensure you leave with its sense of calm."

              "reviewText": "Gurudwara Bangla Sahib is not just a religious place—it's an experience of peace, humility, and spiritual calm right in the heart of Delhi. Whether you're religious or not, a visit here truly touches your heart.\n\nThe marble architecture, gold-plated dome, and peaceful Sarovar add to the beauty of the place. You’ll also see many people sitting quietly, meditating, or simply soaking in the positive energy.\n\nPersonally, I really enjoy coming here, and I almost always visit alone. Sitting quietly by the Sarovar (holy pond) and listening to the peaceful bhajans (hymns) brings a deep sense of calm. It’s a beautiful place to pause, reflect, and simply be present. 🧘‍♂️💛\n\nEverything here—from the langar (community kitchen) to the volunteers cleaning the floor—speaks of seva (selfless service) and equality. No matter your background, everyone is welcomed warmly and fed with love. 🍛🙏\n\nQuick Tips 📝:\n\n🧢 Head covering is compulsory for everyone—scarves are available at the entrance.\n👣 Shoes are to be removed before entering (there’s a proper shoe counter)\n🕒 Best time to visit: Early morning or evening for a peaceful vibe.\n🍲 Don’t miss the langar—simple food, full of love and meaning.\n📸 Photography is not allowed inside.\n💧 You can also drink or take some holy water from the Sarovar.\n🛕 There’s also a small museum inside about Sikh history, worth a quick visit.\n\n📍 Nearest Metro Station: Shivaji Stadium (Airport Express) or Patel Chowk (Yellow Line)—both are walkable\n\nTry coming via Patel Nagar Metro Station—the Sikh community there offers free rides to Bangla Sahib and cold drinking water to visitors. It's a kind and thoughtful service that reflects the true spirit of seva 🙏🚐\n\nFinal Thought 💬:\nBangla Sahib is more than a historical or religious site—it’s a place to slow down, reflect, and feel connected. You don’t need to understand everything to feel the peace here. Even a short visit can leave you with a calm mind and a warm heart. 🌸✨"

The ambience felt cozy and welcoming, perfect for relaxing with friends or family. The service was smooth and the food presentation looked appealing, adding to the vibe ✨.\n\nOrder & Ratings:\n🍕 Farm Pizza – ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆ (4/5)\nThe pizza was loaded with fresh toppings, baked evenly, and had a great balance of flavors. Definitely worth trying.\n\n🍗 Grilled Chicken – ⭐️⭐️⭐️✨ (3.5/5)\nThe flavor was nice and seasoning on point, but it needed a little more cooking to reach that perfect tenderness.\n\n🍄 Grilled Mushroom – ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)\nThis dish stole the show! Juicy, flavorful, and grilled to perfection. Highly recommend it to anyone visiting.\n\nOverall: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆ (4.2/5)\nThe food was awesome and satisfying, with standout dishes like the grilled mushrooms. Just a bit more consistency in preparation (especially with the chicken) and this cafe could easily be a full 5-star spot 🌿."

Overlooking a serene lake, the fort features ancient ruins, a madrasa, mosque, and tomb built in Indo-Islamic style. It’s perfect for a quiet stroll, photography, or watching the sunset. Entry is free, and the site is open from sunrise to sunset. While there’s limited signage, the atmosphere is rich with history. Located next to Hauz Khas Village, you can explore cafes and shops nearby. Accessibility is limited due to uneven terrain, and there are no restrooms on-site. Despite minor maintenance issues, it's a great spot for history lovers or anyone seeking calm in the city."

It perfectly blends history with a peaceful atmosphere, making it a must-visit for anyone who enjoys heritage sites. The fort’s ruins, combined with the large lake, create a very scenic and photogenic environment. If you are into history, architecture, or photography, this place will not disappoint.\n\nWalking through the old tombs, mosques, and broken walls gives you a glimpse of Delhi’s past. The view during the evening is especially breathtaking, when the sunlight reflects on the lake and the whole place feels calm and serene. The surrounding Hauz Khas Village area also has plenty of trendy cafés and restaurants, so you can easily spend a relaxed evening here after exploring the fort.\n\nThat being said, the site could definitely use better maintenance. Some walls are defaced with scribbles, and cleanliness is not always up to the mark. These issues take away a little from the overall charm of the monument.\n\nStill, Hauz Khas Fort remains a peaceful escape from Delhi’s busy streets. It’s a great place to spend a few hours with friends, family, or even alone if you just want some quiet time with history and nature."

I had heard so much about it and was glad to finally see it in person.\n\nWe left all our belongings—including phones, cameras, and bags—in the car, as absolutely no electronics are allowed inside. The rules are very strict, and there are multiple security checks. While I understand the need for security, the staff at the entry checkpoints came across as quite rude. The pat downs felt unnecessarily rough, which made the start of our visit a bit uncomfortable.\n\nThe structures themselves are breathtaking. The intricate carvings, massive domes, and the scale of the complex are truly impressive. It’s clear that an incredible amount of work and devotion went into creating this space. But it was extremely crowded, and the overwhelming number of people made it hard to enjoy the beauty. At times it felt almost suffocating, especially under the intense afternoon heat.\n\nMy five and seven year old were just not able to take much from the experience. Even though I pointed out the beautiful details and architecture, they were too hot and tired to engage. We had looked forward to exploring the grounds more, but between the crowd and the heat, we had to cut it short.\n\nThere are definitely peaceful corners here—fountains, gardens, and shaded walkways—but overall, the experience felt more hectic than calming. I can see how it could be meaningful on a cooler, quieter day, but for us, it was a bit too much."

Had issues purchasing the tickets as they only have it online and the UI is not very good. In the end had to use alternative methods to purchase the tickets. Had a guide who shared about the fort. Make sure you visit the tomb which is across the road. Highly recommended if you want to avoid the crowds."

              "reviewText": "Tughlaqabad Fort, a 14th-century marvel in Delhi, is a must-visit for history buffs! Built by Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq in 1321, this massive fort with its towering stone walls and 13 remaining gates showcases Tughlaq dynasty architecture. Highlights include the underground passages, rainwater tanks, and the nearby red sandstone mausoleum. The fort’s rocky hill setting and eerie legend of a Sufi saint’s curse add mystique, though it was abandoned just six years after construction. Open 7 AM–5 PM, entry is INR 20 for Indians, INR 200–250 for foreigners. Easily reachable via Tughlaqabad Metro Station, it’s a captivating, slightly haunting glimpse into Delhi’s past. Ghiyasuddins tomb is just adjacent. North Western part of the fort is not open to tourists. Limited car Parking available."

I took a private bus for ₹10 that dropped me off at okhla mod(turn) 2.5kms away from where i took an auto for 60₹ to reach the fort.\nthere are a lot of monkeys tho you can ask guards to chase them away for you.\nWhile returning there were hardly any auto in sight, asked for ₹100 to metro. i took a public bus (717b) from bus stop to reach badarpur border metro that took like almost an hour to reach and i didnt get any seat(maybe because it was school timing)."

Built by Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq in the 14th century, the fort's imposing walls and remnants of a once-grand city offer a powerful sense of history. It's a great spot for a peaceful walk, away from the usual chaos of Delhi's more popular monuments. You can spend a good amount of time exploring the vast, sprawling ruins and imagining what the city might have been like in its prime. The views from the top are also quite good, providing a nice panoramic of the surrounding area.\n​However, the experience is decidedly \"average\" due to its current condition. Much of the fort is in ruins, and not in a well-preserved way."

              "reviewText": "Recently, I had the opportunity to visit Tughlakabad Fort in New Delhi, and it turned out to be an unforgettable experience that blended history, architecture, and a sense of timeless grandeur.\n\nBuilt in 1321 by Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq, the founder of the Tughlaq dynasty, this fort was envisioned as a stronghold against Mongol invasions. It served both as a fortress and a city, showcasing the ruler’s ambition and military foresight.\n\nThe fort is spread across a massive area, once boasting thick stone walls, massive bastions, and a complex layout that made it nearly impenetrable. Even today, despite being in ruins, the sheer scale and strength of the structure left me in awe.\n\nOne fascinating aspect of Tughlakabad’s history is the curse associated with Saint Nizamuddin Auliya, who allegedly cursed the fort saying \"Ya rahe ujjar, ya basey gujjar\" (\"It will remain deserted or be inhabited by shepherds\"). Walking through the ruins, I could feel the eerie, mysterious aura that still lingers.\n\nI was particularly impressed by the monumental gateways, stone corridors, and the remnants of the royal palace and secret passages. Every corner seemed to whisper tales of battles, betrayals, and royal grandeur.\n\nAnother highlight of my visit was seeing the Ghiyas-ud-din Tughlaq’s Tomb, connected to the main fort via a causeway. The tomb, surrounded by gardens, is a beautiful example of Indo-Islamic architecture.\n\nThe fort's elevated position gave me panoramic views of the surrounding landscape, and I could easily imagine how this strategic location offered advantages for defense centuries ago.\n\nThe experience was a mix of admiration for the architectural brilliance and reflection on how time slowly reclaims even the mightiest of human creations.\n\nI would recommend wearing comfortable shoes, carrying water, and being ready to explore for a few hours, as the fort complex is vast and rugged.\n\nOverall, visiting Tughlakabad Fort was like taking a step back into the 14th century. It deepened my appreciation for Delhi’s layered history and the incredible stories hidden within its ancient walls."

The rains drench the pathways and revive the dense canopy of trees, giving the entire area a refreshing charm. Walking along the serene lake, one can witness calm waters dotted with ducks and ripples created by gentle showers, all surrounded by thick greenery that looks almost magical under the cloudy skies. The freshness in the air, mixed with the earthy scent of wet soil, makes every step feel rejuvenating.\n\nThe pathways, lined with ancient trees and overhanging branches, create a natural tunnel where morning walkers and nature lovers stroll peacefully. On one side, the tranquil waters of the Hauz Khas Lake stretch wide, while on the other side, green lawns and thick forests provide a serene backdrop. The reflections of trees in rainwater puddles add to the enchanting monsoon mood. The tall, old trees standing proudly in clusters showcase the timeless beauty of this heritage landscape.\n\nVisiting this place during the rains is an experience in itself – the atmosphere feels calm yet alive, the sound of raindrops mingles with chirping birds, and the vibrant greenery offers a soothing retreat. Whether for a morning walk, photography, or simply to sit and enjoy the view, Hauz Khas Lake in monsoon reminds you how nature can still thrive in the heart of Delhi, offering peace and beauty to anyone who pauses to admire it."

Tucked away behind the numerous shops in Hauz Khas village, this magnificent monument reveals itself slowly to us as we approach it. The ruins around of are that of the madrasa founded by Sultan Firuz Shah Tughluq in the 14thcentury. It is built on the edge of the tank, which supplied water to the capital city of Siri. It was built by Alauddin Khalji, the ruler of Siri, who called it Hauz i Alai. Later, Firuz Shah repaired it and called it the Hauz Khas. The madrasa is a double storeyed structure, the colonnaded halls probably being lecture halls. At the junction of the two wings of the madrasa is Firuz Shah’s tomb. It has been recently repaired; however, one of the graves in the chamber was badly damaged yet again. The plaster decoration is however, much more visible after the restoration work. The tomb entrance is enclosed in a most unusual railing pattern. One is not sure what inspired Firuz Shah to come up with this; it is similar to patterns on Buddhist monuments such as the Sanchi stupa. Moving a little ahead there are steps leading down to the lower storey. Here we see some cell like structures: extremely tiny, a small ventilator and an opening acting as a doorway. There probably were rooms for students. There are also some pavilions in the lawns which contain graves. These are probably burials of officers or teachers associated with the madrasa. Our heritage walk also covered monuments in Deer Park. The most prominent monument in the Deer Park is the Bagh i Alam ka Gumbad, a lodi period tomb with an adjacent mosque. Closeby is a small hut like structure called the Kali Gumti. The last stop on our heritage trail in Hauz Khas was the Tuhfewala Gumbad, a Tughluq period tomb with some striking cenotaphs."

Located in the trendy neighborhood of Mehrauli, this cafe has quickly gained popularity among food enthusiasts looking for something a bit more refined.\n\nThe first thing you'll notice when you walk in is the contemporary yet cozy atmosphere. The space is beautifully designed with a mix of modern and rustic touches, perfect for both casual meals and intimate gatherings. The seating is comfortable, and the open kitchen concept adds a sense of openness to the space.\n\nWhen it comes to the food, Cafe Dori definitely delivers. The menu offers a variety of options, from European-inspired dishes to lighter, health-conscious choices. Highlights include their expertly crafted salads, freshly baked pastries, and delicious mains like the truffle risotto and wood-fired pizzas. The ingredients are of high quality, and the flavors are well-balanced, making each dish a treat for the palate.\n\nHowever, the one downside is the pricing. The food is undeniably good, but it does come at a premium. While the quality justifies the cost to some extent, the overall experience can feel a bit on the pricier side, especially if you're visiting frequently or ordering multiple courses. The drinks, in particular, can be quite expensive.\n\nDespite the steep prices, the food, service, and overall vibe make Cafe Dori a place worth visiting for those looking to indulge. It’s a great choice for a special occasion or when you're in the mood to splurge a little. Highly recommended!"

However, the flavors were a bit bland, and both the pasta and shrimp were slightly overcooked.\n\nAs for the katsu chicken sandwich, it could have been better. The chicken was cooked well, but it didn’t pair nicely with the buttered toasted bread, which made the sandwich feel too heavy and dry. A few more vegetables or a touch of pickle would have helped balance the taste. The fries were also a letdown. They were too oily and could have been larger and less crispy."

We then ordered a flat bread with chicken and tomatoes etc which was very nice. We also ordered their summer salad that had quinoa, and some fruit. The description had mangoes in it but there weren't any but still it was quite tasty. We then ordered the chicken chermoula over quinoa and spiced yogurt. All very good. We ended it with a delicious cup of cortado. All in all, it was a good lunch."

              "reviewText": "One of the Best Places for a Day Out in Delhi!\n\nDelhi Zoo (National Zoological Park) is undoubtedly one of the best places in Delhi for a fun and educational day outing, especially with kids. It's a famous tourist attraction that offers a chance to see a wide variety of animals and mammals including lions, elephants, white tigers, hippos, deer, and many more!\n\nKids absolutely love the experience — from watching majestic animals up close to exploring the Reptile House, which showcases snakes, crocodiles, and other reptiles.\n\nThe entry fee is very reasonable — ₹40 for kids and ₹80 for adults. There's ample paid parking space, and refreshment shops are available inside the zoo for snacks and drinks. A proper food court is located just outside the zoo as well, so you won’t go hungry.\n\nThe nearest metro station is Supreme Court Metro Station, making it easily accessible. Just note that the zoo is closed on Fridays, so plan accordingly.\n\nHighly recommended for families, nature lovers, and tourists exploring Delhi! 🌿🦁🐘🐊"

The place is huge and has a decent variety of animals – from tigers and leopards to elephants, deer, birds, and reptiles. It's a nice green space in the middle of the city, which makes it feel peaceful and refreshing.\n\nWhat I really liked was how spacious and clean the zoo was, especially compared to what I expected. The enclosures seemed reasonably maintained, and some animals looked quite active. Renting an e-cart was a good decision since the zoo is spread out – definitely recommended if you're going with family or elders.\n\nA few downsides though: some enclosures felt a bit empty or under renovation, and I wish there were better signs or information boards about the animals. Food options inside were also pretty limited, so it’s a good idea to carry your own snacks and water (though outside food isn’t allowed inside).\n\nOverall, it’s a nice spot to spend 2–3 hours, especially with kids or if you're a nature lover. Wouldn’t say it’s a \"must-visit\" in Delhi, but definitely worth checking out at least once."

The entry ticket is ₹80 per adult, which is quite reasonable considering the experience you get. The nearest metro station is Supreme Court, and from there, you can take an auto to the zoo – it should cost ₹60 for two people; don’t pay more than that.\n\nThe zoo itself is beautifully maintained, with wide shaded pathways, lush greenery, and clean surroundings. The variety of animals is impressive – from lions, tigers, leopards, and elephants to colorful birds, reptiles, and deer. The enclosures are spacious and designed to keep the animals comfortable, while still allowing visitors to get a good view.\n\nIt’s a great place for families, friends, and nature lovers. Children especially will enjoy seeing the animals up close, and it’s also quite educational. There are benches and rest spots throughout, so you can take your time exploring without rushing. The ambience is peaceful and refreshing, making it the perfect break from city life.\n\nOverall, Delhi Zoo is a must-visit if you want a budget-friendly, relaxing, and educational outing in Delhi. A day here is time well spent."

However, for solo visitors, it may feel boring after a while. The zoo is spread over a large area, and walking the full route can get exhausting, especially during summer. There is a battery-operated transport facility available inside, but it comes at an extra cost and moves too quickly — which can reduce the fun of observing the animals properly. Still, it’s worth visiting once to see the variety of animals and spend a relaxed day with kids or family. Well-maintained and nature-rich."

It's sprawling, well-maintained, and offers a good variety of animals, including the majestic White Tigers, Asiatic Lions, rhinos, and a wide array of birds. Visiting during the cooler months (October to March) is highly recommended, as the weather is pleasant for walking, and the animals are more active. It's a great educational outing for families, and the battery-operated buggies are a lifesaver for covering the vast area, especially with kids or elderly visitors. Remember to book tickets online in advance, as they don't sell physical tickets at the counter."

Our kids enjoyed learning about the deep ancient roots of the modern toilet system and funny humorous takes and comics that they had posted in the museum about bathroom situations.  They have relics and specimens of toilets from almost every age in history.\n\nThis is easy access to the airport, and a great option if you have only a few hours for a layover and don’t want to fight through the murderous traffic to red fort."

What we experienced there was far more enriching than we had anticipated.\n\nThe museum, established by Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak, is a unique and insightful space dedicated to the history and evolution of toilets from ancient times to the modern era. The museum manager personally guided us through the exhibits, providing a detailed and engaging explanation of the transformation of sanitation practices across various civilizations. From primitive open defecation systems to intricate medieval commodes and modern bio-toilets, the collection showcases how hygiene, technology, and culture have shaped toilet design over centuries.\n\nEach exhibit was not only informative but also deeply thought-provoking. It was eye-opening to realize how much of a role sanitation plays in shaping public health and dignity, especially in developing countries like India. The historical context provided added a fascinating dimension—underlining how societies, both ancient and modern, have grappled with the challenges of waste management.\n\nFor my son, the visit was an excellent learning experience. He came away with a deeper understanding of how poor sanitation impacts the environment and human health, and why change is necessary. The session was more than just an academic exploration—it was a call to action.\n\nIndia, with its growing population and urban sprawl, urgently needs a sanitation revolution, and institutions like Sulabh are doing commendable work in spreading awareness. I highly recommend this museum to parents, educators, and policymakers alike. It is a place where history, science, and social responsibility come together to inspire a cleaner, more conscious future."

You get the feeling that they're truly passionate about their foundation and answering all your queries. The museum is also fully air conditioned and spotless, a welcome escape from the Delhi heat.\n\nThe museum is actually just part of the experience. Their main goal is to raise awareness about the importance of accessible toilet facilities and clean drinking water. They have another building focusing on their water sanitation and effluent treatment initiatives. Outside, you'll see the different types of septic systems they construct in rural areas. adding to that, the museum is completely free to the public.\n\nWhen I visited, it was completely empty. They're open 7 days a week. There's also plenty of parking available inside if you're arriving by car. This museum is definitely worth a visit if you're visiting Delhi with family and friends."

According to Time magazine, the museum is one of the weirdest museums among the \"10 museums around the world that are anything but mundane\". It was established in 1992 by Dr. Bindeshwar Pathak, a social activist, founder of Sulabh Sanitation and Social Reform Movement.\n\nEstablished in 1992, the museum has exhibits from 50 countries. Sanitation artifacts, spanning from 3000 BC through the end of the 20th Century, are arranged chronologically: \"Ancient, Medieval and Modern.\" The items on display include privies, chamber pots, decorated Victorian toilet seats, toilet furniture, bidets and water closets in vogue since from 1145 AD to the present. Display boards have poetry related to toilets and their use.\n\nSome of the interesting and amusing objects and information charts on display are: a reproduction of a commode in the form of treasure chest of the British medieval period; a reproduction of the supposed toilet of King Louis XIV which is reported to have been used by the king to defecate while holding court; a toilet camouflaged in the form of a bookcase; information on the technology transfer from Russia to NASA to convert urine into potable water, a deal of $19 million; display boards with comics, jokes and cartoons related to humour on toilets;  toilet pots made of gold and silver used by the Roman emperors; information about flush pot designed in 1596 by Sir John Harington during Queen Elizabeth I's regime; the sewerage system that existed during the Harappan Civilization; and historical information from the Lothal archaeological site on the development of toilets during the Indus Valley civilization."
