Commissioned in 1890 by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III, the palace was designed by Charles Mant and Robert Chisholm, known for their Indo-Saracenic architecture that blends European and South Asian styles. The sprawling palace is adorned with bronze sculptures by Italian artist Fellici Casorati.",

            "text": "The ticket price for Indian adults is ₹250, which is quite steep compared to other heritage sites. Although the palace itself is architecturally stunning and rich in history, the experience falls short in a few key areas. One of the highlights is the complimentary audio-visual guide provided through a Sony Walkman with multilingual options. It's easy to use and provides a good amount of information about the palace. A complete visit typically takes 1 to 2 hours.\n\nThe palace, constructed in 1880, is beautifully designed, with special mentions going to the majestic Durbar Hall and the Armoury Hall. The view of the golf course from outside is particularly impressive. There is also a small canteen and a shopping area within the premises. However, while parts of the palace are well maintained, other aspects such as the fountains and overall visitor facilities are lacking. For the ticket price, one would expect better upkeep and more sections of the palace open to the public.\n\nOne major downside is the behavior of the security staff. Many visitors have found the guards to be extremely rude and poorly trained in handling tourists. While discipline is important in protecting a heritage site, their unwelcoming attitude significantly affects the visitor experience. Overall, it's a place worth visiting for those passionate about history, but be prepared for a few disappointments along the way. It's closed on Monday since they have maintenance on that day.",

It was erected by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1906–07 as a gift to the city municipality to mark the silver jubilee of his administration. The offices of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation are located here.\nThe market was built by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1906–07 and named after his predecessor and adoptive father, Khanderao Gaekwad, Maharaja of Baroda (1856–1870). This market is a palatial commercial building located on Chamaraja Road in Vadodara, Gujarat, in western India. It was erected by the Maharaja as a gift to the city municipality to mark the silver jubilee of his administration. It was built at the cost of about ₹3 lakh (equivalent to ₹10.0 crore or US$1.2 million in 2023).\n\nThe market was designed in Indo-Saracenic style by English architect Robert Chisholm before his return to England. The two-storey building has two bays connected by an overhead passage with a large central dome rising to a height of 86 feet. Both bays are 70 feet long and 34 feet wide with a cloister around them. It is constructed from bricks and mortar and clad with Dhangdhra stones. The 16 stalls on the ground floor of the main building are occupied by municipal offices, while other stalls on two sides are used by 192 shops. The open courtyard between these two sides is 181 feet long and 156 feet wide and has a central junction.\n\nThe main gate takes inspiration from the gate of Dabhoi Fort, while the domes are inspired by Hindu temples and the arches are influenced by Islamic architecture. The perforated stone screens are similar to those of Agra.\n\nThe statue of Maharaja Khanderao placed in the courtyard was sculpted by Vinayak Pandurang Karmarkar and was inaugurated by Sayajirao Gaekwad III on December 23, 1935.\n\nIn the present day, the offices of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation are located here. Fresh vegetables, fruits, and flowers are sold within the market premises.",

What impressed me the most was their ability to truly understand my vision. They listened carefully to my ideas and preferences, and then translated them into a design that perfectly captured the aesthetic I was hoping for. The final design is exactly what I had in mind – even better, actually!\n\nNot only are they great designers, but they also kept everything on schedule, which was a big plus. They were super organized and paid attention to every single detail. Seriously, they were there for everything, making sure it all went smoothly. If I had any questions or worries, they were always there to help. They didn't just finish the big stuff and disappear; they stayed until every little thing was perfect.\n\nIf you need an interior designer who's talented, reliable, and really cares about making you happy, I highly recommend Hirenbhai and Dhara. They turned my house into a beautiful and functional home, and I'm so grateful for their hard work. They're a fantastic team, and I'd definitely hire them again!\n\nP.S. Bonus is that I get so many compliments on my home starting from the day of the Vastu puja! :-)",

Also they have maintained the budget decided in the beginning with regular monitoring. They are excellent service provider even after handover for minor damage by my family members as it is very difficult to get labour team for small work. But they have supported like anything. Their relationship is precious and they maintain the same for long time. I would blindly recommend them for interior work in your home. Best of luck to Chirag and team for better future ahead.👍👍👍",
