It is dedicated to Lord Shiva, in his Dakshinamurthy form, symbolizing wisdom and enlightenment.\n\nThe EME Temple is a must-visit for those who appreciate unique architecture, spirituality, and peaceful surroundings. It's an excellent place for devotees, tourists, and history enthusiasts alike. Whether you are religious or not, the temple's ambience and design make it worth visiting at least once.\n\nArchitectural Significance:\n\nThe temple stands out with its geodesic dome structure, made of aluminium sheets, which is quite rare for a religious site. Designed with a futuristic approach, it incorporates elements from various religions:\n\nThe dome represents Islam\n\nThe tower (Shikhara) takes inspiration from Hindu temple architecture\n\nThe entrance resembles a Christian church\n\nThe golden structure inside symbolizes Buddhism\n\nThe grill work is inspired by Jain temples",

The sunset view here is just magical - the sky was painted in soft hues of pink, orange, and blue, creating a perfect blend with the surrounding greenery.\n\nThe garden is very well-maintained with clean walkways, blooming plants, and tall, shady trees that make for a relaxing stroll. The statue area and gazebo were beautifully lit, giving the park a warm and welcoming vibe even during the evening. Birds flying above and the gentle breeze added to the charm of the place.\n\nIt's not just a zoo, but a space where nature and tranquility meet. A must-visit for anyone coming to Vadodara - perfect for evening walks, photography, or simply unwinding with nature.",

There is no ticket system in place, but you do have to purchase a parking ticket, which costs 10rs for 2-wheelers and 20rs for 4-wheelers.\n\nI have visited this place multiple times with my friends and colleagues, and it has become a go-to spot for spending quality time. However, it's important to come prepared as the area tends to be quite sleepy. Additionally, while the water is clear, it's disheartening to see that tourists and other people are spreading garbage in the water, which affects its beauty.\n\nThat being said, I highly recommend this place as a must-visit. It serves as a simple check dam where you can hang out with friends. The best time to go is during the evening sunset, which offers a picturesque view. You can also find vendors selling corn and packed snacks for your convenience. The roads leading to the place may not be in the best condition, so having a 2-wheeler is preferable.\n\nOverall, it's a beautiful site to spend time with your family or friends. If you visit early in the morning, you can enjoy the peaceful atmosphere, while the sunset adds an extra touch of magic. Moreover, during the monsoon season, this place offers a unique adventure feel.\n\nIt's important to remember to take care of nature and avoid spreading garbage around. Let's all contribute to maintaining the cleanliness and beauty of this place.",

It was erected by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1906–07 as a gift to the city municipality to mark the silver jubilee of his administration. The offices of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation are located here.\nThe market was built by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1906–07 and named after his predecessor and adoptive father, Khanderao Gaekwad, Maharaja of Baroda (1856–1870). This market is a palatial commercial building located on Chamaraja Road in Vadodara, Gujarat, in western India. It was erected by the Maharaja as a gift to the city municipality to mark the silver jubilee of his administration. It was built at the cost of about ₹3 lakh (equivalent to ₹10.0 crore or US$1.2 million in 2023).\n\nThe market was designed in Indo-Saracenic style by English architect Robert Chisholm before his return to England. The two-storey building has two bays connected by an overhead passage with a large central dome rising to a height of 86 feet. Both bays are 70 feet long and 34 feet wide with a cloister around them. It is constructed from bricks and mortar and clad with Dhangdhra stones. The 16 stalls on the ground floor of the main building are occupied by municipal offices, while other stalls on two sides are used by 192 shops. The open courtyard between these two sides is 181 feet long and 156 feet wide and has a central junction.\n\nThe main gate takes inspiration from the gate of Dabhoi Fort, while the domes are inspired by Hindu temples and the arches are influenced by Islamic architecture. The perforated stone screens are similar to those of Agra.\n\nThe statue of Maharaja Khanderao placed in the courtyard was sculpted by Vinayak Pandurang Karmarkar and was inaugurated by Sayajirao Gaekwad III on December 23, 1935.\n\nIn the present day, the offices of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation are located here. Fresh vegetables, fruits, and flowers are sold within the market premises.",
