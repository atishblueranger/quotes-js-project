              "reviewText": "The ticket price for Indian adults is ₹250, which is quite steep compared to other heritage sites. Although the palace itself is architecturally stunning and rich in history, the experience falls short in a few key areas. One of the highlights is the complimentary audio-visual guide provided through a Sony Walkman with multilingual options. It’s easy to use and provides a good amount of information about the palace. A complete visit typically takes 1 to 2 hours.\n\nThe palace, constructed in 1880, is beautifully designed, with special mentions going to the majestic Durbar Hall and the Armoury Hall. The view of the golf course from outside is particularly impressive. There is also a small canteen and a shopping area within the premises. However, while parts of the palace are well maintained, other aspects such as the fountains and overall visitor facilities are lacking. For the ticket price, one would expect better upkeep and more sections of the palace open to the public.\n\nOne major downside is the behavior of the security staff. Many visitors have found the guards to be extremely rude and poorly trained in handling tourists. While discipline is important in protecting a heritage site, their unwelcoming attitude significantly affects the visitor experience. Overall, it’s a place worth visiting for those passionate about history, but be prepared for a few disappointments along the way. It’s closed on Monday since they have maintenance on that day."

Tell others about your experience 200 words\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nMy Experience at Laxmi Vilas Palace – A Journey into Royal Grandeur (200 words)\n\nVisiting the Laxmi Vilas Palace in Vadodara was like stepping into a living chapter of royal history. Spanning over 500 acres, the palace is four times the size of Buckingham Palace and leaves you awestruck with its Indo-Saracenic architecture. The grand Durbar Hall, with its ornate mosaic floors, Belgium stained glass windows, and Venetian chandeliers, truly showcases the opulence of the Gaekwad dynasty.\n\nThe highlight of my visit was the audio-guided tour, which made the stories behind each artwork and antique come alive. The impressive collection of Raja Ravi Varma paintings and the royal armory gave insight into the lifestyle and taste of the erstwhile rulers. The beautifully landscaped gardens and golf course surrounding the palace added to its charm.\n\nWhat made the experience even more memorable was the sense of pride and preservation — the palace is still the residence of the royal family, and yet parts of it are open to the public. It felt like a rare blend of heritage and living tradition. If you're a lover of history, art, and architecture, Laxmi Vilas Palace is an unforgettable destination that captures the essence of royal India."

A portion of the palace is open to visitors, while the rest is still the residence of the royal Gaekwad family from the Maratha dynasty, which adds a unique charm to the place.\n\nThe palace complex also includes a golf club and has ample space for parking. It is very well maintained, and the architecture is breathtaking. At the ticket counter, they accept both cash and cards, but UPI payments are not accepted.\n\nThey provide free audio guides in Marathi, Gujarati, and English, which are really helpful for understanding the history and significance of the palace. Do note that photography is not allowed inside the palace, but you are free to click photos in the outer areas."

It was erected by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1906–07 as a gift to the city municipality to mark the silver jubilee of his administration. The offices of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation are located here.\nThe market was built by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1906–07 and named after his predecessor and adoptive father, Khanderao Gaekwad, Maharaja of Baroda (1856–1870). This market is a palatial commercial building located on Chamaraja Road in Vadodara, Gujarat, in western India. It was erected by the Maharaja as a gift to the city municipality to mark the silver jubilee of his administration. It was built at the cost of about ₹3 lakh (equivalent to ₹10.0 crore or US$1.2 million in 2023).\n\nThe market was designed in Indo-Saracenic style by English architect Robert Chisholm before his return to England. The two-storey building has two bays connected by an overhead passage with a large central dome rising to a height of 86 feet. Both bays are 70 feet long and 34 feet wide with a cloister around them. It is constructed from bricks and mortar and clad with Dhangdhra stones. The 16 stalls on the ground floor of the main building are occupied by municipal offices, while other stalls on two sides are used by 192 shops. The open courtyard between these two sides is 181 feet long and 156 feet wide and has a central junction.\n\nThe main gate takes inspiration from the gate of Dabhoi Fort, while the domes are inspired by Hindu temples and the arches are influenced by Islamic architecture. The perforated stone screens are similar to those of Agra.\n\nThe statue of Maharaja Khanderao placed in the courtyard was sculpted by Vinayak Pandurang Karmarkar and was inaugurated by Sayajirao Gaekwad III on December 23, 1935.\n\nIn the present day, the offices of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation are located here. Fresh vegetables, fruits, and flowers are sold within the market premises."

This market is a treasure trove, offering a wide variety of fresh fruits, vegetables, and flowers, both at wholesale and retail prices. The produce is always fresh, and the atmosphere is lively and vibrant.\n\nOne of the best parts about shopping here is interacting with the vendors—they are amazing! Their friendly nature and the bargaining system add to the fun of shopping. Additionally, the market offers everything needed for ritual activities, including Pooja items. Overall, a great place to experience the local culture and pick up high-quality goods. Highly recommended!"

Managed by the Indian Army, this temple is a fine blend of modern architecture, spiritual significance, and historical importance. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva, in his Dakshinamurthy form, symbolizing wisdom and enlightenment.\n\nThe EME Temple is a must-visit for those who appreciate unique architecture, spirituality, and peaceful surroundings. It’s an excellent place for devotees, tourists, and history enthusiasts alike. Whether you are religious or not, the temple's ambience and design make it worth visiting at least once.\n\nArchitectural Significance:\n\nThe temple stands out with its geodesic dome structure, made of aluminium sheets, which is quite rare for a religious site. Designed with a futuristic approach, it incorporates elements from various religions:\n\nThe dome represents Islam\n\nThe tower (Shikhara) takes inspiration from Hindu temple architecture\n\nThe entrance resembles a Christian church\n\nThe golden structure inside symbolizes Buddhism\n\nThe grill work is inspired by Jain temples"

Built by the Gaekwad dynasty, it now serves as an Indian Air Force training facility, restricting public access.

Also they have maintained the budget decided in the beginning with regular monitoring. They are excellent service provider even after handover for minor damage by my family members as it is very difficult to get labour team for small work. But they have supported like anything. Their relationship is precious and they maintain the same for long time. I would blindly recommend them for interior work in your home. Best of luck to Chirag and team for better future ahead.👍👍👍"

What impressed me the most was their ability to truly understand my vision. They listened carefully to my ideas and preferences, and then translated them into a design that perfectly captured the aesthetic I was hoping for. The final design is exactly what I had in mind – even better, actually!\n\nNot only are they great designers, but they also kept everything on schedule, which was a big plus. They were super organized and paid attention to every single detail. Seriously, they were there for everything, making sure it all went smoothly. If I had any questions or worries, they were always there to help. They didn't just finish the big stuff and disappear; they stayed until every little thing was perfect.\n\nIf you need an interior designer who's talented, reliable, and really cares about making you happy, I highly recommend Hirenbhai and Dhara. They turned my house into a beautiful and functional home, and I'm so grateful for their hard work. They're a fantastic team, and I'd definitely hire them again!\n\nP.S. Bonus is that I get so many compliments on my home starting from the day of the Vastu puja! :-)"

Although the palace itself is architecturally stunning and rich in history, the experience falls short in a few key areas. One of the highlights is the complimentary audio-visual guide provided through a Sony Walkman with multilingual options. It’s easy to use and provides a good amount of information about the palace. A complete visit typically takes 1 to 2 hours.\n\nThe palace, constructed in 1880, is beautifully designed, with special mentions going to the majestic Durbar Hall and the Armoury Hall. The view of the golf course from outside is particularly impressive. There is also a small canteen and a shopping area within the premises. However, while parts of the palace are well maintained, other aspects such as the fountains and overall visitor facilities are lacking. For the ticket price, one would expect better upkeep and more sections of the palace open to the public.\n\nOne major downside is the behavior of the security staff. Many visitors have found the guards to be extremely rude and poorly trained in handling tourists. While discipline is important in protecting a heritage site, their unwelcoming attitude significantly affects the visitor experience. Overall, it’s a place worth visiting for those passionate about history, but be prepared for a few disappointments along the way. It’s closed on Monday since they have maintenance on that day."

Tell others about your experience 200 words\n\nChatGPT said:\n\nMy Experience at Laxmi Vilas Palace – A Journey into Royal Grandeur (200 words)\n\nVisiting the Laxmi Vilas Palace in Vadodara was like stepping into a living chapter of royal history. Spanning over 500 acres, the palace is four times the size of Buckingham Palace and leaves you awestruck with its Indo-Saracenic architecture. The grand Durbar Hall, with its ornate mosaic floors, Belgium stained glass windows, and Venetian chandeliers, truly showcases the opulence of the Gaekwad dynasty.\n\nThe highlight of my visit was the audio-guided tour, which made the stories behind each artwork and antique come alive. The impressive collection of Raja Ravi Varma paintings and the royal armory gave insight into the lifestyle and taste of the erstwhile rulers. The beautifully landscaped gardens and golf course surrounding the palace added to its charm.\n\nWhat made the experience even more memorable was the sense of pride and preservation — the palace is still the residence of the royal family, and yet parts of it are open to the public. It felt like a rare blend of heritage and living tradition. If you're a lover of history, art, and architecture, Laxmi Vilas Palace is an unforgettable destination that captures the essence of royal India."

Its most striking feature is the massive golden statue of Lord Shiva, standing tall and radiant in the middle of the lake.

The walkway around the lake is well-lit and offers a relaxing escape from the city's noise. The sound of water and the gentle breeze make the experience even more calming.\n\nSur Sagar Lake is not just a landmark—it’s a place where tradition, devotion, and natural beauty come together. Whether you're visiting for the first time or have seen it many times before, it never fails to leave a lasting impression."

It was erected by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1906–07 as a gift to the city municipality to mark the silver jubilee of his administration. The offices of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation are located here.\nThe market was built by Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III in 1906–07 and named after his predecessor and adoptive father, Khanderao Gaekwad, Maharaja of Baroda (1856–1870). This market is a palatial commercial building located on Chamaraja Road in Vadodara, Gujarat, in western India. It was erected by the Maharaja as a gift to the city municipality to mark the silver jubilee of his administration. It was built at the cost of about ₹3 lakh (equivalent to ₹10.0 crore or US$1.2 million in 2023).\n\nThe market was designed in Indo-Saracenic style by English architect Robert Chisholm before his return to England. The two-storey building has two bays connected by an overhead passage with a large central dome rising to a height of 86 feet. Both bays are 70 feet long and 34 feet wide with a cloister around them. It is constructed from bricks and mortar and clad with Dhangdhra stones. The 16 stalls on the ground floor of the main building are occupied by municipal offices, while other stalls on two sides are used by 192 shops. The open courtyard between these two sides is 181 feet long and 156 feet wide and has a central junction.\n\nThe main gate takes inspiration from the gate of Dabhoi Fort, while the domes are inspired by Hindu temples and the arches are influenced by Islamic architecture. The perforated stone screens are similar to those of Agra.\n\nThe statue of Maharaja Khanderao placed in the courtyard was sculpted by Vinayak Pandurang Karmarkar and was inaugurated by Sayajirao Gaekwad III on December 23, 1935.\n\nIn the present day, the offices of the Vadodara Municipal Corporation are located here. Fresh vegetables, fruits, and flowers are sold within the market premises."

They should be more strict about people not using their mobile phones while the show is on.\nSee that you reach at least 5 - 10 mins before the show, so that you can see the small exhibition / pictures / models kept near the ticket window.

It showcases the grandeur and artistic inclination of the Gaekwad royal family.\n\n2. The museum is housed in a building that was originally meant for the education of royal children, giving it a regal yet academic ambiance.\n\n3. The collection is impressive and includes original paintings by Raja Ravi Varma, European oil paintings, sculptures, marble works, and porcelain artefacts collected by the royals from trips abroad.\n\n4. One of the most captivating parts of the museum is the sculpture gallery, which displays beautiful Greek and Roman-inspired statues, giving visitors a feeling of walking through a European art gallery.\n\n5. There’s a section dedicated to Japanese and Chinese art, which adds a touch of global aesthetics to the museum experience.\n\n6. Entry tickets are reasonably priced, usually bundled with Lakshmi Vilas Palace access, making it a great value for money.\n\n7. The museum is air-conditioned and well-maintained, offering a comfortable environment to view artworks even during summer.\n\n8. Audio guides are available, offering insights into each exhibit and enhancing the overall understanding of the displayed works.\n\n9. Photography is not allowed inside the museum, which helps preserve the art but might be disappointing to some visitors.\n\n10. The museum can be explored in about 1 to 1.5 hours, and it’s ideal for art lovers, history enthusiasts, and even students of culture.\n\n11. Staff is courteous and security is well-managed, ensuring a peaceful visit.\n\n12. Located just about 3–4 km from Vadodara Railway Station and Airport, the museum is easily accessible by cab or auto.\n\n13. There are clean washrooms and some seating areas inside, though there is no in-house cafeteria.\n\n14. It's recommended to pair the museum visit with a tour of the Lakshmi Vilas Palace to get a complete royal experience of Vadodara.\n\n15. Overall, a deeply enriching and inspiring destination that reflects the vision, taste, and legacy of the Gaekwads—definitely worth visiting when in the city."

Both properties are on same BIG land parcel, but different gates, There is golf cart available @25 RS (INR) per person to take you from internal road FROM PALACE TO MUSEUM- I highly recommend taking it to get a quick round of the property. But you have to go back for your vehicle. Suggest to visit the palace by Autorickshaw /Ola /Uber.\n\nNo photography allowed inside, phones have to be deposited at entrance. This was a School building that was remodelled as museum. There are lot of art & sculptures , unique & someone who understands art will appreciate it. There are many royal family photos, statues & portraits The space is not air conditioned. With such a fantastic & rare collection  the museum needs appropriate lighting ,temperature & humidity control which is lacking."

Erected in 1935 to commemorate Maharaja Sayajirao Gaekwad III’s 60-year reign, this monument is constructed from pink Songadh stone and is crowned with a lion facing eastward. This orientation signifies the Maharaja’s transition from worldly duties to a life of spiritual pursuit, embodying the Hindu concept of ‘Vanaprastha’—the stage of renunciation and advisory role in life. Situated near the Polo Ground, Kirti Stambh not only showcases architectural elegance but also encapsulates the philosophical depth of the Gaekwad dynasty’s legacy."

The sunset view here is just magical - the sky was painted in soft hues of pink, orange, and blue, creating a perfect blend with the surrounding greenery.\n\nThe garden is very well-maintained with clean walkways, blooming plants, and tall, shady trees that make for a relaxing stroll. The statue area and gazebo were beautifully lit, giving the park a warm and welcoming vibe even during the evening. Birds flying above and the gentle breeze added to the charm of the place.\n\nIt’s not just a zoo, but a space where nature and tranquility meet. A must-visit for anyone coming to Vadodara - perfect for evening walks, photography, or simply unwinding with nature."

Strolling through the lush 113-acre garden, I admired the vibrant floral clock and enjoyed a scenic ride on the joy train. The Baroda Museum captivated me with its diverse exhibits, including an Egyptian mummy and a blue whale skeleton. A show at the Sardar Patel Planetarium offered an engaging glimpse into the cosmos. Encounters with majestic Asiatic lions and colorful birds at the zoo added to the day's excitement. Overall, Sayaji Baug provided a perfect blend of relaxation and exploration, making it a memorable highlight of my trip."

This 19th-Century structure served as the residence of Bhau Tambekar, once Diwan of Baroda state.“Tambekar Wada is built around a courtyard and has a rectangular grid of rooms,\" says Sonali Lele Desai, architect and actor. “The delicate woodwork and the intricate paintings offer a window into Maratha architecture.”A flight of steep stairs takes you to Vadodara’s hidden treasure: rooms bursting with a riot of colour, courtesy fresco-secco work. Walls, columns, doors, windows, even the door jambs are painted with mythological murals and ornate floral motifs in vibrant colours. Stories from the Mahabharata and the Puranas can be seen on the walls, with Krishna omnipresent.“Apart from these, there are non-religious paintings that hark back to history: the British attack on a Maratha fort, scenes from the Anglo-Maratha war, beautiful floral motifs, and more,” Lele Desai says.

              "reviewText": "Built somewhere between 1849-1854, this three storey Maratha style mansion belonged to the Tambekar family who initially migrated as sahukars from Maharashtra following the Maratha conquest of Gujarat in the 18th century. Vitthalrao Khanderao Tambekar (Bhau Tambekar) who the wada is attributed to served as a Dewan to the then Maharaja of Baroda state. Bhau Tambekar later got into trouble with the British for having links with Indian nationalists and had to abandon the premises.\n\nFollowing this event the wada was converted into a school, during which the painted galleries here suffered maximum damage due to lack of caution. Finally in the year 1951 the ASI took charge of the building and exercised some level of conservation.\n\nSeen above are some interior pictures of the galleries from the guest wing, covered entirely with frescoes from floor to ceiling. Sadly this is the only part open to visitors today"

Many involve scenes from Hindu scriptures such as Krishna hiding clothes while the gopis bathe. Unlike most heritage attractions in Vadodara, photographs ARE permitted. Access is via stairs. I did not see any alternative route for people with limited mobility.\nHowever, the site is being restored or refurbished, so that may be addressed in the future."

There are really beautiful paintings, murals, wood carvings inside. The caretaker had gone for lunch when I was there so I could see even areas that are normally off limits to visitors (see attached pics). I don't know if the stuff inside is original or has been restored by the ASI. Only the front two floors are open for viewing the rest is in a dilapidated condition."

There is no ticket system in place, but you do have to purchase a parking ticket, which costs 10rs for 2-wheelers and 20rs for 4-wheelers.\n\nI have visited this place multiple times with my friends and colleagues, and it has become a go-to spot for spending quality time. However, it's important to come prepared as the area tends to be quite sleepy. Additionally, while the water is clear, it's disheartening to see that tourists and other people are spreading garbage in the water, which affects its beauty.\n\nThat being said, I highly recommend this place as a must-visit. It serves as a simple check dam where you can hang out with friends. The best time to go is during the evening sunset, which offers a picturesque view. You can also find vendors selling corn and packed snacks for your convenience. The roads leading to the place may not be in the best condition, so having a 2-wheeler is preferable.\n\nOverall, it's a beautiful site to spend time with your family or friends. If you visit early in the morning, you can enjoy the peaceful atmosphere, while the sunset adds an extra touch of magic. Moreover, during the monsoon season, this place offers a unique adventure feel.\n\nIt's important to remember to take care of nature and avoid spreading garbage around. Let's all contribute to maintaining the cleanliness and beauty of this place."

Located along the Mahi River, this riverside beach is perfect for a relaxing day out with family or friends. I recently visited the place, and it was a refreshing break from city life.\n\nThe natural beauty here is truly calming – gentle river flow, clean sand, and lush greenery around. It’s not a commercial tourist spot, which makes it even better for those who enjoy quiet and less-crowded locations. We reached in the early morning hours and were welcomed by a stunning sunrise view across the river.\n\nIt’s a great place for photography, small picnics, or just spending quality time with loved ones. There’s enough open space for children to play and for adults to sit back and unwind. However, I’d recommend bringing your own snacks, water, and mats as there are very few facilities nearby.\n\nOverall, Sindhrot Beach is a perfect nature spot close to Vadodara, and it deserves more attention for its calm and beauty. Ideal for nature lovers, and definitely worth multiple visits!"

The photographer’s approach was incredibly professional and friendly, making the entire session smooth and enjoyable. He has won several international awards, and it clearly shows in the quality of his work.\n\nWhat really stood out was how he guided us—especially our children—into natural, comfortable poses that turned out beautifully. He was excellent at capturing candid moments that feel genuine and full of emotion.\n\nThe shoot was completed within the promised timeline, and his editing work is simply mind-blowing. Every photo looks polished, vibrant, and full of life. His team was also very supportive and helped make the whole experience stress-free.\n\nHighly recommended if you're looking for a top-notch photographer with both talent and a great attitude"

Though it's more of a river location than a traditional beach, it provides a serene setting perfect for a relaxing day out. The highlight is the kayaking experience, which is available at an affordable price and adds a touch of adventure to your visit. The views, especially at sunrise and sunset, are spectacular and offer a stunning backdrop for photos.\nAdditionally, there are snack options available, making it easy to enjoy a meal or a treat while you take in the surroundings. Overall, Kotna Beach is a great spot for a leisurely outing and is highly recommended for its unique charm and enjoyable activities."

Either visit early morning(6-8) or Evening after(5:30-6).\n4. Can enjoty party, games, and boating in river.\n5.Boating price is quite high but 100Rs/Person ifs a descent negotiation you can do.\n6.Local shops are available where you can get bhajiya, packaged food, water bottles, icecream coldrink etc.\n7. Route of reaching this place may be little bit challenging as is pass through inside village.\n8.Water is not that much pure, but still you will find so many guys taking bath into this.\n9. Beach generally close arround 7:30 in summer after sunset , it will become early during winter and rainy season.\n10. Beach is somehow dirty, but it's ok."
