My only negative would be the weeds right at the top of the castle.  That aside, it was a great day for pictures of the Quayside skyline with the bridges and cathedral with St James park in the distance.\n\nNewcastle council also could maybe clear the street (to the left as you look at the entrance of the Keep).",
