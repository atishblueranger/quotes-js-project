The area is clearly marked out as a naturist beach and you can plonk yourself anywhere you like. I was fortunate to have a really nice day with very little breeze and I felt comfortable stripping down and basking in the sunshine. The beach is pebbles, as with most beaches in Brighton, so definitely take a towel with you as I certainly will when I next return. Everyone there was just happy enjoying the sunshine and freedom, and no one bothered me as I lay there. If you go just be confident and strip off as you will see all shapes and sizes. Not recommended on a chilly day though 🤭",

Not that the beach doesn't get busy–it does, but it tends to draw a more adult crowd than the family-oriented main beach. In addition to sunbathers catching the rays on the mostly shingle beach (some sand is revealed at low tide), Kemptown Beach is popular for activities such as windsurfing, surfing, paddleboarding, and kayaking.",
