This is one of my regular places to visit, have a coffee, enjoy the excellent dining with a great lunch menu and I've never been disappointed. Then step out into the fabulous gardens which are laid out with paths to suit everyone and I've supported wheelchair users to enjoy the gardens so it's very manageable. The glass houses are amazing and winter or summer give the visitor a special experience in our varied Dublin climate. Take your time to spend your time in this exceptional natural environment  and I've always managed to get parking in the adjacent car park. Take a guided tour as you will find it so interesting and informative and the guides are a world of knowledge about the trees that fill the Botanical Gardens. You will go once and return again and again!",

Spoke to the kids and made the experience nice.\nWe had fun looking for all the 9 cats in the garden and got some nice photos.\nDefinitely worth a little look round if near by .",

Arrived early and there was plenty of space for pictures as it was quiet. Exhibits were well laid out, and explained at the start, along with markers in the lifts in case you got confused. So much to see and learn about. Several interactive features too which kept the kids happy. Friendly and welcoming staff, along with some really unique items to see. By far the best museum I have been to on this island. Would 100% go back, with or without kids. Good for all ages, easy to find, and right in the middle of the botanical gardens for the added beauty as you're walking up. Parking is pretty limited to on-street so I would recommend parking up along the embankment and walking through the gardens. Also, it's completely free to visit!",

            "text": "\"The Big Fish,\" also affectionately known as the \"Salmon of Knowledge.\" It's a hugely important and iconic landmark in Belfast for several reasons. Commissioned in 1999, The Big Fish was created to celebrate the regeneration of the River Lagan and the surrounding Donegall Quay area. Its location at the confluence of the River Farset (which Belfast is named after) and the River Lagan further emphasizes the city's deep historical connection to its waterways and maritime past. It represents a forward-looking Belfast while acknowledging its roots. One of the most fascinating aspects of The Big Fish is its unique \"skin.\" It's covered in over 2,000 ceramic tiles, each decorated with texts and images that tell a story about Belfast's history. These include everything from Tudor times to present-day newspaper headlines, industrial scenes (like Harland and Wolff, the shipbuilders of the Titanic), and contributions from Belfast schoolchildren. It's essentially a giant, interactive history book for the city. The sculpture is also known as the \"Salmon of Knowledge,\" referencing an ancient Irish legend from the Fenian Cycle. In this myth, a salmon gains all the knowledge in the world, and the first person to eat its flesh will also gain that wisdom. This mythical connection adds a layer of cultural depth and storytelling to the artwork. The Big Fish is a prominent landmark and Tourist Attraction in Belfast. Its striking appearance and central location on Donegall Quay make it a frequent stop for tourists and a popular spot for photos. Its image often appears on tourism materials for Belfast and Northern Ireland. To summarise The Big Fish is much more than just a large stone sculpture. It's a multifaceted symbol representing Belfast's regeneration, its rich maritime history, its connection to ancient Irish folklore, and its vibrant artistic spirit.",

Lewis, the author of The Chronicles of Narnia. It's a must-visit spot for fans of literature, fantasy, and local culture.\n\nOpened in 2016, this urban park features seven stunning bronze sculptures inspired by The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, created by Irish artist Maurice Harron. The square is part of the Connswater Greenway, a regeneration project that turned old industrial land into a vibrant, walkable community space.\n\nFun Facts\n•\tC.S. Lewis was born just a few blocks away from the square, at Little Lea, and spent much of his childhood in Belfast.\n•\tThe wardrobe sculpture is cleverly positioned at the entrance to give you the feeling of stepping into Narnia.",

The statues dotted around are fun to find and explore.\n\nNegatives - it was really dirty and had rubbish everywhere: in the grass bits behind the benches, all over the paved bits (even found a big shard of glass), and along the paths. It did not make me want to bring my kids and dog to the area!\nNot to mention it smelled like 💩 which must be a local sewage issue.\n\nI will give it another try some time soon with the hope that the council will up their game in making it a tidier place and I'd gladly change my review.",

Don't reccomend using google maps if you go from east side, as there is a land of bushes you will have to go through, climb fences and get through couple of dead ends, especially if you are climbing up. First time I've even skipped the pathway up, google were showing me to climb over the concrete wall and go up the path that were visibly rarely used, then climb the spiked fence to the field of cows and afterwards go through dead-end of trees and bushes I got through somehow only to later ram my way through narrow path full of bushes taller than human. Some of theese bushes has thorns and the path is slippery and narrow even most avid hikers and mountaineers, so be ready if you will get there by google accident. I reccomend you go through the right side of the zoo, that google just won't direct you through if you go throughout the east side. But overall, I went up, and left satisfied as a mountaineer and photographer. And keep in mind that right below the cliff from the east side there are a small cave that can be easily missed if you choose the same questionable path I've mentioned at the start. Northern Ireland may be small in size, but people here are nice and friendly and the land itself are full of rare gems you can see only in few places in the world, for example, Giant's Causeway I highly recommend everyone who reads that to visit, and see this rare wonder just about an hour north from the Cavehill by car.

However, the staff have this bar running like a well-oiled machine. They make sure to find you a seat and keep your glass full. I was very impressed and had a great pint! I highly recommend it!!!",
