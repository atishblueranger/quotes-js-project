He sat us at a lovely table by the window and made sure we were very well looked after. Our waiter was Gabor, who similarly was very friendly and genuinely only interested to ensure we had a lovely experience. He filleted out fish in front of us and took time to recommend all the specials. The food was absolutely fantastic. My favourite of all the dishes was the dover sole. Even the desserts at the end were fantastic. We will definitely be back soon and would recommend this restaurant to anyone. Fantastic food, but absolutely the staff made our evening so special. It felt like nothing was too much trouble for them.",

My wife and I have just returned from a 2 month stay in the Algarve's biggest fishing port where seafood and fresh fish is obviously plentiful so we were wondering how we would fare on our return to the UK after that. We were not disappointed, the XL prawns were locally sourced, fresh and absolutely delicous. The ribeye steak was perfectly cooked and the Piri-piri Monkfish my wife had was also excellent. It's not cheap, but it's more than a meal - it's an experience - the wines, top class service and ambiance all adds to it and the hosts clearly take great pride in what they do, so it's worth paying the extra if you can afford it. They claim it's Brighton's best seafood restaurant and I have no reason to doubt that. It's certainly a high bar.\n\nLooking forward to coming back one day, sadly we don't get to Brighton more than once a year.",

Though not cheap (except a ridiculously good value prawn to start), it is well worth a visit on a special occasion. The staff and service and ambience created an unforgettable evening that will be difficult to replicate.\n\nTo start I had snacks salmon tacos and a grilled prawn. Despite the salmon tacos being delicious, the prawn stole the show, being meaty and sweet, and for £3.50 with the seaweed Alioli, I cannot complain. For starters, the bbq squid was the best looking dish of the night, stunning, with perfectly cooked squid, a sauce maybe a touch too sweet, but interesting textures and bold flavours. For mains, the lamb saddle could've been cut with a butter knife, paired with some simple but lovely veg, a jus made from the belly and some majorly crispy 100-layer chips, and you're on to a real winner. The puddings were also solid, and a great way to end a great meal!",

Why don’t you cosy up to each other at an outside screening?. Take in a late Friday night showing of a classic, or catch your favourite sports event – they’re showing it all throughout the summer.",

            "text": "What an absolutely fantastic place to celebrate an anniversary! ❤️\nWild Flor is just gorgeous - from the friendly greeting at the start of the evening, all the way through to settling the bill, we enjoyed every moment of our time here.\nThe restaurant has a really calming, cosy ambience to it. The staff are so friendly and attentive without being overbearing, and they had even written us a card wishing us a happy anniversary!! So thoughtful 🥹\nThere is an extensive wine list and a great selection of cocktails - we really enjoyed our glasses of the verdinho and rosé, and the Todoli Margarita we paired with our pudding was zesty, fresh and incredibly strong!! You have been warned 😆\nThe star of the show at Wild Flor is, of course, the food. We kicked off with the ink battered squid, which was expertly partnered with fennel, saffron, and blood orange. I haven't had anything like this before - the combination was a bit mind-blowing!! All starters come with delicious sourdough bread and butter, too. We used ours to mop up the saffron sauce 😋\nWe chose the bavette steak and Chalk Stream trout for our mains, and shared the confit potato side dish, which was crispy and incredibly moreish. The steak was cooked to perfection. If I was being hyper-critical, I would say that the wilted spinach (which somehow seemed to have been cooked very well but still retained its crunch - impressive) was intensely garlic flavoured. I am a massive garlic fan, so not an issue - but even to me it was a little overpowering! My partner really enjoyed the Chalk Stream trout dish - I tried a piece and it was perfectly cooked.\nWe finished up with the aforementioned Margarita and the limequat & coconut ‘key lime pie'. This pudding was sensational - creamy, zesty, and melt-in-the-mouth. We shared the pudding but I wish I had ordered my own one to be honest - I could have eaten 10 😅\nThanks so much for a wonderful evening, Wild Flor - we can't wait to come back and try many more menus!! ✨",

I tried the lobster special and it was the best lobster I've ever had, the potato salad and bisque was insane and everything was ultimately tasty. We also tried the beef croquettes, oysters and prawns for starters which were all delicious and perfectly prepared, my partner absolutely adored the chocolate pot for dessert as well. The wine list is perfect, I had the cheapest vinho verde as wanted to spend more on my food and it was still fantastic.\nOnly thing I wouldn't recommend was the margarita but that's just my personal preference (no salt rim, not on the rocks so if you like that then go for it!)\nOur servers were great too, extremely good service thank you guys!",

We completed the Aquatic and Zootopia games which were surprisingly much more difficult than we anticipated. When we visited, the Jurassic game (which we originally booked) was closed due to a leak- but we were contacted before arrival asking if we wanted to change it to a different game which was equally as amazing. The staff were really helpful and the props were awesome. Would be a great day out with kids as there's food there too (and also nearby in case you want something different). We have ordered alcoholic drinks which was part of the date night deal they had which were delicious and fun! Would highly recommend going here whether it's with friends, family, or as a date.",

The bread was sourdough bread, and had a really nice and deep flavor with a sour hint to it.\n\nAs a starter, we got the ravioli filled with salmon. The pasta itself was nicely cooked, the filling was delicious with the right amount of salmon, and the accompanying sauce acidic to break through the richness of the ravioli.\n\nAs a main we got the Gilt-Head Bream with gnocchi. The fish was crispy, but its flesh cooked just right, flaky and tender. The gnocchi were light and cloud-like. For dessert we got the cheese, and although it's not a dish that they have made themselves, the Montgomery Cheddar was a nice way to end the meal.\n\nService was impeccable: friendly and at the right pace. Moreover, at the end Chef Duncan himself came up to check on us and see how we enjoyed the meal, which was a nice touch.\n\nNext time I visit Brighton I'll try to make a point to try to have dinner at the Little Fish Market.",

Service was friendly; the ladies were lovely, if a bit stretched as everyone arrived at the same time, we waited 25 minutes to order a drink and could tell they were doing their best. At a set £85 a head it was a big treat for us, so I was disappointed to be told that, although the main was listed as being part of the tasting menu, you had to select your fish which all came with a minimum supplement of £18 per pair, pushing it to £94 pp. The fish which arrived was delicious, but was probably a quarter of a fish to share, unlike the whole fish advertised on the sample menu online with no mention of extra cost. I think if you are paying this kind of money for food, it may not matter to lots of people, but I thought it should be mentioned on the website as I felt misguided and it tainted it a little for me.",

            "text": "Amazing food, faultless service, but a shame about the extra non-advertised charge for the fish. My partner and I had dinner here as a special treat for our anniversary, at £85 a head it is not our everyday meal! The food was incredible, special mention to the Thai-inspired Monkfish and the signature 'egg and soldiers'. The service was of a very high standard, with the waitress explaining every course in detail and continuously topping up our wine. The restaurant does feel a little 'cold', (decor and lighting-wise), it could use a few touches to feel a bit more cosy. The wait between courses is fairly long so be ready for that, but we had prepared ourselves for being there for a while as it was a tasting menu and of course it gave us time to chat! However the thing that was disappointing is that we had to pay a supplement for the main fish course that was not advertised anywhere on the website. This varied per fish chosen, but even the cheapest option added an extra £10 per person on top of an already very expensive meal. I think for £85 a head plus service, (total bill £268), this should have been included, or at least advertised to be that way on the website.",

Not all of the animal names were visible in the glass cases portion, and there weren't additional placards providing information about each species, which I would've liked, but I may have also missed a QR code or something that led to an online guide.\n\nThe back portion was no less fun, and the informational placards there had some humor! There was one about the rhinoceros skull with artificial horns that poked fun at their value-- since they weren't real, they couldn't be used in Chinese medicine or we'd be sick or sold at cocaine-level prices.\n\nAnyway, it's a quaint smaller museum in Brighton :) I liked it for an afternoon activity to spend a few hours in.",

The atmosphere was perfect, with multiple rooms and an outside area to allow people to chat/dance/sit to eat. With the Tempest also hosting music events it meant we were able to use their speakers, decks and lights which meant our guests were dancing till the early hours!\n\nThe food package was perfect for what we needed and at great value, tasty buffet foods for soaking up drinks! The kitchen staff were also able to cater for all dietary needs which was very important to us as the Bride is a coeliac (gluten-free).\n\nThe staff were amazing! Bec sorted all of the behind the scenes organisation and explained exactly what was on offer to us. The rest of the front of house crew and chefs were great with helping us with anything we needed on the day. Especially the manager with the earpiece (who we never caught the name of, sorry!) who was very friendly and attentive. Thank you so much to everyone!\n\nOverall, anyone reading this for event hire should not hesitate. The Tempest is such a great location to get to for multiple guests, has sea views, delicious food and friendly, helpful staff. Their refurbishment and new kitchen menu has really paid off for them. The reactions we got from our guests speak to this review too.",

We were looking for somewhere to go for a cocktail as we were leaving the next day and bit of live entertainment. We had already walked past during the day and had pointed out what a lovely place it looked so I was quite glad that we got the chance to go back. We sat by the bar and downstairs it wasn't particularly busy but the atmosphere and the place is just so welcoming warm and comfortable. It's a nice place to be in.The bar Staff were absolutely fantastic Finn was the initial bartender on his own and when it picked up, he still kept up the pace he was Making complicated cocktails for people but will still be personable fast and letting customers enjoy the cocktails that he had made. He was then joined by Callam who also worked just as hard it was in refreshing watching people enjoy their jobs. A small note I would like to also add is that I was impressed on how hot they were on ID and everybody that came into the bar. The bar started to fill up and the atmosphere just got even better. They had a live band there that evening that we're doing covers of songs and they to were very interactive and just really made the whole place come alive (the iron boot scrappers) We had some quite theatrical cocktails and a few drinks and left after a few hours, but we will definitely be back for food and more drinks the next time we are back thank you for a great time.",
