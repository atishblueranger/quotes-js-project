It symbolizes peace, progress, and an optimistic vision of the future. The design is based on the elemental structure of iron and represents a shift towards using atomic energy for positive purposes. Initially intended as a temporary installation, it captured the hearts of Belgians and has become one of Brussels' most renowned attractions.",

Representing an iron unit cell (9 iron atoms) magnified 165 billion times, the monument with its unique silhouette has, over time, grown to become the symbol of Brussels and Belgium. On the inside the Atomium offers, not just the most beautiful view of Brussels, but also an entirely astounding and surreal ride through its interior spaces and volumes which alone makes a visit worth it.",

The arcade has an ensemble of shops, from the biggest names in fashion to unique collectibles plus a few restaurants/cafes to enjoy a delicious meal. There's also pastry and biscuit shops, Belgium Chocolate Shops, jewellery shops and others. The building itself is stunning, it's an ensemble of three glazed shopping arcades. It consists of the King's Gallery, the Queen's Gallery and the Prince's Gallery. The galleries were designed and built between 1846 and 1847. Its's really a masterpiece, the architecture left me feeling breathless. The see through glass ceiling was magnificent, the way it reflected the sun down onto the shops below was amazing. A showstopper! 😍 It's simply a blend of sophistication, culture and history accumulating into the perfect place to shop and explore. I suggest trying to visit during both the day and night. It's quite stunning with the lights on at night. It's particularly crowded on weekends so maybe try during the week. We spent quite a few hours just wandering, exploring the shops and then had a wonderful meal. It was an awesome experience. I loved it. Thumbs up!!! 👍👍👍",

You can sit on the grass, have a picnic, or take nice photos. Sometimes people ride bikes or run here. It's a peaceful place close to the city-perfect for taking a break or hanging out with friends",

The statue is known for its extensive wardrobe of over 600 outfits, with different costumes displayed during festivals and events throughout the year.",

Overall it is quiet inside, at times there were student group tours. I can imagine this must be horizon-broadening experience for the kids, actually for myself too.

What really makes the visit special is the interactive audio guide.

            "text": "A Jewel with Shadows: Reflections on the David and Alice van Buuren Museum\n\nVisiting the Van Buuren house in Brussels is nothing short of stepping into a Gesamtkunstwerk-an architectural pearl, indeed, where every corner hums with the harmony of Art Deco elegance, meticulously curated furnishings, and a private collection that rivals many public museums. The house is a triumph of design, a rare and refined testimony to the creative spirit of the interwar years, blending Dutch rationalism with Belgian Art Deco and a cosmopolitan touch.\n\nBut what makes this place truly significant is not only its aesthetic perfection, but the story it contains-and perhaps, too often, under-tells.\n\nDavid van Buuren, a banker and art collector of Dutch-Jewish descent, and his wife Alice created this sanctuary of beauty and intellect in a Belgium that seemed, on the surface, open and modern. Yet even such cultivated, socially integrated figures-pillars of the Brussels bourgeoisie-were not immune to the devastating tide of antisemitism that swept across Europe. During the Second World War, the Van Buurens were forced to flee Belgium. Their home, ironically designed to be a temple of peace, music, and art, was occupied by the very forces that sought to annihilate everything they stood for.\n\nThis bitter historical irony lingers between the polished parquet and the radiant stained-glass windows. And it deserves to be more explicitly acknowledged.\n\nThe museum today, while dazzling in its curatorial care, tends to foreground its decorative brilliance and the couple's contribution to the arts, without fully grappling with the fragility of their position in a Europe that betrayed its Jews-not only in ghettos and camps, but in living rooms and salons. In a time where antisemitism is again alarmingly on the rise across the continent, the story of the Van Buurens should resonate as more than a backdrop. It is essential context.\n\nTheir return after the war, their continued engagement with the arts, and their decision to leave their home to the public as a cultural trust is not merely a tale of generosity-it is a quiet act of resistance. An insistence that beauty and culture, even when built on precarious ground, can outlast barbarism.\n\nThis house is not just about design. It is about memory, resilience, and the unspoken question: how can a home filled with light survive such darkness?\n\nTo honour the Van Buurens fully, the museum might consider integrating more visible, thoughtful interpretation around their wartime experience. Visitors deserve to see not only the sumptuous upholstery, but also the fragile threads of history that run beneath it.",

If you're a fan of trains or have kids who are into them (like ours!), this place is a dream.\n\nThe whole museum is so well put together, with a perfect mix of old and new trains on display. You can actually walk through some of the older locomotives, which gives you a real sense of how train travel used to be, and it's fascinating.\n\nThe attention to detail is amazing, and there's plenty of interactive elements that keep both kids and adults entertained. Our toddler was completely captivated by everything, and we had just as much fun exploring the exhibits. The layout is great for wandering around at your own pace, and you can easily spend hours here without getting bored.\n\nThe staff were really friendly, and the whole experience was both educational and fun. They've done a fantastic job of making it engaging for all ages, whether you're a train enthusiast or just curious. If you're visiting Brussels and looking for something a bit different, we c!an't recommend Train World enough – it's a brilliant experience",
