They want you to arrive about 10 mins early, so you may have to wait to for your tour to start.\n\nThe tour guide we had was funny, thoughtful and really knew the history of the property.\n\nThe tickets include tickets to the fairy gardens and the butterfly gardens. Both of those spots were great for the kids.\n\nThis property is so large that you can easily spend an entire day looking at everything. They have a shop, cafe, gift shop, restaurant, and a large playground for the kids.\n\nThis is absolutely worth the money, and a really fun stop while in Dublin.",

            "text": "St. Patrick's Cathedral, located in the heart of Dublin, is a must-visit for anyone exploring Ireland's capital. This stunning Gothic cathedral, founded in 1191, is not only a significant religious site but also a treasure trove of history and culture. As Ireland's national cathedral and one of its largest, it offers a captivating experience for visitors of all interests.\n\nThe cathedral's exterior is striking, with its towering spire and intricate stonework setting a grand tone. Inside, the soaring ceilings, vibrant stained-glass windows, and beautifully preserved medieval architecture create an awe-inspiring atmosphere. The intricate floor tiles and ornate memorials, including those dedicated to Jonathan Swift, the cathedral's most famous dean and author of *Gulliver's Travels*, add layers of historical depth. Swift's legacy is a highlight, with his tomb and personal artifacts, like his death mask, on display.\n\nThe self-guided audio tour is excellent, providing clear and engaging insights into the cathedral's history, architecture, and notable figures. It's well-paced and informative without being overwhelming.  It was crowded on the day we went and was a bank holiday.\n\nThe surrounding grounds are equally charming, with a peaceful garden offering a quiet escape from Dublin's bustle. The adjacent St. Patrick's Park is perfect for a reflective stroll or a quick picnic. The coffee shop in the park is a welcome relief.\n\nOverall, St. Patrick's Cathedral is a breathtaking blend of spirituality, history, and architectural beauty. Whether you're drawn by its connection to St. Patrick, Ireland's patron saint, or simply its cultural significance, it's a highlight of Dublin that leaves a lasting impression. Highly recommended!",

The waiting area was clean and well-organised, with a small bar where you could order a drink before the tour started.\n\nThe tour itself lasted around 40–45 minutes and followed a structured route through different parts of the building. Our guide was knowledgeable and spoke clearly throughout, providing a general overview of the history of Jameson, its founder John Jameson, and the basic principles of Irish whiskey production. There were visual displays and some interactive elements, though nothing particularly hands-on. The storytelling was steady, if a little rehearsed, and the pace moved along without any rush.\n\nTowards the end of the tour, we reached the tasting section. We were given three small samples – and talked through the basic tasting notes. It was a helpful way to understand the distinctions, even for someone without much prior whiskey knowledge. Afterward, we received a complimentary drink at the bar, which was included in the price of the ticket.\n\nThe gift shop offered a selection of bottles and branded merchandise, and it was easy to browse through before leaving. Overall, the tour was fine. It provided a clear and accessible introduction to Irish whiskey, particularly for casual visitors or those new to the spirit. While it didn't feel especially immersive or unique, it was professionally run and easy to enjoy without requiring much prior interest in whiskey.\n\nA solid way to spend an hour in Dublin - not unmissable, but pleasant and well put together.",

From the welcome drink to learning all about Ireland's whiskey-making heritage, every stage was informative, engaging, and a lot of fun. The guided tasting at the end was excellent - with clear explanations that made it easy to appreciate even if you're not a big whiskey 🥃 drinker (like me). No surprise it's won awards for being one of the top whiskey tours - we absolutely loved the whole experience together ❤️",

            "text": "I just had the most incredible experience at the Jameson Distillery Bow St. Tour in Dublin! From the moment I stepped in, I knew I was in for a treat. The ambiance was top-notch, and the facilities were sleek and modern. But what really made the visit stand out was our amazing tour guide - he was super passionate about Jameson and its rich history. He took us on a journey through time, showing us how Jameson's iconic whisky is made and what sets it apart from the rest.\n\nThe highlight of the tour was definitely the whisky tasting - we got to sample three different types of Jameson, and let me tell you, it was a game-changer. The \"Grain to Glass\" process was fascinating, and our guide did an excellent job of explaining it in a way that was easy to understand. Plus, the comparative whisky tasting was a great way to learn about the different flavors and notes.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that you won't actually get to see the whisky being made - it's more of a theatrical experience. But trust me, it's still totally worth it. The Jameson Distillery Bow St. Experience is a must-visit for anyone in Dublin, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves whisky, history, or just wants a unique and immersive experience. So go ahead, book your tour, and get ready to be blown away by the rich history and smooth flavours of Jameson!",

Not a beer drinker but the Guiness here tastes so different than back home. It's creamier and smoother.\n\nAfterwards we had lunch in the 1837 restaurant. The food was surprisingly good. Ordered Irish oysters (meh overall, no horseradish) which I didn't love but the traditional Irish beef stew and the cod were amazing.",

We bought our tickets online ahead of time for a 9:30 Friday time slot (you have a 15 minute grace period). I recommend coming early because there wasn't as many people, but it started filling up later on. We opted for the Guinness Storehouse Experience + Guinness Academy, which includes a self-guided tour of the museum, learning how to pour your own pint, and a drink at the Gravity Bar. While the beer isn't actually brewed here, it's still fun to see the history of Guinness, and all the memorabilia.\n\nI would say that the museum + pouring your own pint took about 90 minutes. We got up to the Gravity Bar by 12 and it was already packed. There are two rooms with tables that you can grab your drink and sit down at. We got lucky and found a seat for myself, my husband, and a stroller but I did see some people sharing tables. If you're a large group,  you can forget about sitting together.\n\nDon't forget to stop by the souvenir shop at the end! The prices were shockingly cheap for official Guinness merchandise. I think I got a tote for €3, and some of the things were cheaper than the random souvenir shops in the city.",

Tucked away just behind Harcourt Street and a short stroll from St. Stephen's Green, it's easy to miss-but once you find it, you'll be glad you did. The park is beautifully designed, combining formal landscaping with a natural, relaxed feel. Highlights include elegant fountains, a small waterfall, a charming grotto, and wide open green spaces perfect for picnics or reading a book.\nWhat really sets it apart is the peaceful atmosphere. Unlike other city parks, it's rarely crowded, even on sunny days. It feels like a secret escape right in the middle of the city, offering quiet pathways, shady spots under mature trees, and beautifully maintained flower beds. It's a great place to unwind, have a thoughtful walk, or just enjoy a bit of nature without leaving the city center.\nOccasionally, it hosts events like Taste of Dublin or small concerts, but outside of those times, it remains calm and serene. Whether you're a local or a tourist, it's well worth taking the time to find the entrance and explore this tranquil oasis.",

I got flowers before I came and sat down, and one of the waiters asked me if I wanted some water and he gave me a jug of water for them, which was nice, a small gesture but appreciated.\n\nWe got the Tomahawk Rib eye for 2. It was nice but it wasn't outstanding... I thought it was a bit too salty. The only complaint from my fiancée was that it didn't come with rice 😆 We both had the Gambas for starters...it was a little bit too salty but not too salty that you can't eat and finish it. It was flavourful, I have to say! Overall, it was expensive - €204 for 2 people (we had 2 Gambas, the Rib eye for 2, 1 cocktail, 1 glass of wine, 1 chocolate mousse & 1 tea). The restaurant got quite loud when it got quite busy and people starting talking. Restaurants can fix this issue easily by installing curtains, I don't know more restaurants don't do this.... Especially to cater for more neurodiverse audience.\n\nTL;DR\n\nNice food but the Gambas & the Tomahawk Rib eye were a bit too salty; nice staff; expensive & quite loud",

My friend who attended with me didn't know much about Irish history and the troubles, this enhanced her visit immense making her understand the troubles and the sites she was seeing through out our travels. Listening to the tour and walking through the jail makes you understand how complicated it is. Our our guide did a wonderful job walking us through the history and keeping track of all of us. The saddest part of the jail, of course, it where the executions happened.\nThe gift shop is small but packs quite a bit in it, from books to magazine and other typical souvenirs.\nThe cafe at the Jail has qite a bit to offer for food and drink.\n\nI would highly recommend buying tickets in  advance, as many days were sold out even in the off season. You can walk to the Jail from the middle part of Dublin, but it can be quite a distance. If you choose to walk, as we did, you will go past a many sites that are great for exploration as well, just don't get distracted.",

However, it took us more than 20-30mins to order drinks and get them.\nSommelier said she needs to check but still taking other table's orders and serving. That's understandable since it was getting busier and busier after we came in.\nThe problem was that we didn't even order our food yet until drinks were ready.\nConsequently, we were asked to leave as soon as we finished our main dish because the people next booking arrived for that table.\nOf course, the staff came to apologise and we understood.\nHowever, we were so ready for desserts and more drinks but got really disappointed after being asked to leave because 1h 30mins service wasn't managed properly for us to fully enjoy.",

The restaurant manager greeted us when we arrived, made sure all our needs were met throughout the evening, and personally bid us good-bye, even posing with us on the porch for a picture. The entire staff was perfect as well: coordinated, discrete, they ensured we had a memorable time.\n- Atmosphere was great as well. They invited us to sit in the comfortable cocktail lounge where we studied the menu while enjoying our drinks. In the  restaurant, our group sat at a round table perfect for our party size located in a cozy corner, where we were able to have conversations in a private manner.",

Of course, the food is delicious and the quality of service and the atmosphere and ambience is one of a kind. The staff are all top notch and I must give a special shout out to Diego who was absolutely wonderful and made my wife and I feel so special.They truly elevate the experience to a whole new level of art. A lovely man sat down next to us and asked us how our experience was and my wife said “Oh it's lovely, are you the manager?” And he said “I'm Patrick Guilbaud.” He was so humble and warm and welcoming and chatted with us and took photos too so that was a perfect cherry on top.

They have a delicious seafood pasta, the views are gorgeous and the venue is great!\nHowever, when we came for brunch end of February, our experience was not ideal.\nThe food however was perfect, we ordered two beetroot hummus, quinoa tabbouleh on toasted sourdough with avocado and poached eggs and it was unreal; by far the best avocado toast I have ever tried, I thought all of those flavours together were bold and would not pair nicely but all of the flavours of the dish complemented perfectly. The third person ordered Sophie's Beef Burger and loved it, said it was filling and delicious.\nTo share for dessert we ordered the pancake stack with hazelnut cream, coconut and white chocolate which was superb, again, the flavours were perfectly paired, it was not overly sweet and it was tasty and filling.\nThe customer service was the only flaw in our brunch experience. We came here with a small suitcase since one of the customers was heading to the airport immediately after, and before we sat down and they got the chance to ask whether we could put it somewhere out of the way, the waitress rudely asked us to put it under the counter to not bother servers, which was a fair demand but her delivery was questionable to say the least. We then proceeded to order, and eat and one of the customers asked for a glass of wine after the meal. Shortly after, our waitress handed us the bill, without any prior time warning, saying that she had another booking in 15 minutes. We were shocked because normally, places warn you a couple of times about future bookings so you can time your visit. The person who ordered the wine was especially displeased since she had to drink the wine quickly and was not able to enjoy it.",
