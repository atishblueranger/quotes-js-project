It closes a bit earlier (5pm) on that specific day but otherwise the experience was brilliant. I enjoyed the variety of art and different cultures displayed in the museum. There are good floor plans on every floor and each exhibit is numbered quite clearly. The only thing that I would have appreciated would have been a free map to carry around. There are some available in exchange for a 2£ donation though. I especially liked the Japanese exhibition and room 62. There are benches or seats in most exhibitions which allow for rests or people to sit and sketch. The museum staff were very friendly and open to questions. I especially liked the young man in room 62 and the member of staff with two nice bows in her hair. Thank you for the wonderful afternoon. I Would definitely recommend visiting this museum.",

Entry is free, and it's a must-see for history buffs, especially knowing that C.S. Lewis delivered his famous Weight of Glory sermon here.\n\nClimbing the tower costs £6 and is well worth it, though be prepared: 158 steps await, with about half in a very tight spiral. It gets especially tricky at the top if it's crowded-the narrow passageways make it difficult to pass others, and the path around the tower leads to a dead end, so backtracking is required. Still, the panoramic views of Oxford, particularly of All Souls College and the Radcliffe Camera, are absolutely breathtaking.\n\nBonus tip: do not miss the Vaults & Garden Café right on-site. Delicious food in a beautiful setting. This church and tower climb are a highlight of any visit to Oxford.",

Oxford is one of my home places, and I have visited this museum many times-both while working with families and children and in my free time. Each visit feels like stepping into a treasure chest of human heritage, where every object holds a secret waiting to be discovered.\n\nThe museum's atmosphere is truly unique, with dim lighting and endless shelves of artifacts creating a sense of mystery and wonder. You can spend hours exploring and still find something new each time. It's not just a collection of objects-it's a journey through time, teaching us so much about different civilizations, traditions, and ways of life.\n\nChildren, in particular, are always fascinated by the displays, making it a perfect place for families. Whether you love history, anthropology, or simply enjoy discovering the past through beautifully curated exhibits, this museum is an absolute must-visit. I highly recommend it to everyone-it's a magical experience that stays with you long after you leave.",

The Pitt Rivers and the  joined at the hip Natural History Museum in Oxford are a wonder for the architecture and interior design alone, let alone for the literally hundreds and  thousands of exhibits. Im sure one could spend a lifetime visiting and still not see everything. Better to have an hour or so and a light lunch in the first floor cafe to reflect, otherwise  'exhibit fatigue' could set in. For those visiting with mobility issues you can check the website and phone the museum ahead and book the disabled parking bay right next to the rear entrance. Lifts to all floors so everything is accessible. A cabinet of delights awaits you. You will not be disappointed.  Free entry but you'll want to spend money in the museums shops and cafe or donate to keep this wonderful place of learning and fun alive.",

Unlike many museums who tend to have a smaller selection but more information, this one really has so much to see.\n\nIts natural history section is spacious and ideal for children and families, contained on one floor. The ethnographic section is contained within multiple levels.\n\nAs an avid arms and armour history buff, this is one of the most underrated museums. I don't hear many in the community talk about it, but this place has easily the best collection of ethnographic weaponry I have ever seen.\n\nThe best part is it's free.

The stunning combination of natural beauty, rich history, and architectural grandeur makes it a truly magical experience. Strolling through the peaceful meadows, with picturesque views of the River Thames and the Cherwell, feels like stepping into a painting. The sight of Christ Church Cathedral rising in the background is simply breathtaking, and the tranquil atmosphere offers a perfect escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.\n\nThe highlight of our visit was undoubtedly the guided tour. The tour guides were nothing short of exceptional-friendly, knowledgeable, and clearly passionate about sharing the stories of this historic site. They expertly wove together the history of Christ Church College, its connections to some of the world's most influential figures, and the fascinating details of its architectural evolution. Their storytelling was captivating, filled with fun anecdotes about famous alumni like Lewis Carroll and explanations of how this iconic location inspired parts of “Alice in Wonderland” and scenes from the Harry Potter films.\n\nWhat really stood out was how approachable and engaging the guides were. They took the time to answer all of our questions, whether about the college's historical significance, its ties to the British monarchy, or even the wildlife that inhabits the meadows. Their enthusiasm was infectious, making the tour not only educational but also incredibly enjoyable.\n\nThe experience feels like a blend of walking through history and stepping into a literary and cinematic wonderland. Whether you're a history enthusiast, a literature lover, a Harry Potter fan, or just someone who appreciates beautiful landscapes, Christ Church Meadow and its outstanding tours offer something special for everyone.\n\nI cannot recommend this place enough. It's a perfect day out for families, solo travelers, or couples looking to soak in the magic of Oxford. The meadows, combined with the rich stories shared by the incredible tour guides, make it a truly unforgettable experience. If you're visiting Oxford, don't miss this treasure-it's the kind of place that stays with you long after you've left!",

You can order at the bar or use the QR code on the table, which I always prefer as you can customize your own order on your own time.\n\nThe fish and chips was great. Light batter, big piece, and both the fish and chips were salted well. Tartar sauce was also nice and pickly/acidic. Also appreciated the lemon being grilled!\n\nLoved the atmosphere and food here, great place to grab a pint or meal.",

As well as our table, we booked it half an our later, but we arrived earlier. The staff managed to find a table for us even though we were early!\n\nOn Sunday we recommend the Sunday roasts as they were delicious! As well as the classic fish and chips and for a lighter meal the house salad with fish will be perfect.\n\nThe mini dessert was a surprising, but good combination!

It's easily possible to spend 1.5 to 2 hours exploring all the garden's different areas. Facilities are good, with a small gift shop and toilets onsite.\nAt the time of my visit in June 2025, the entry fee was £9, which seemed reasonable considering the variety of plants to see and the standard of presentation.

Taking a picture with this Baroque-style circular library requires some careful thought, as most of the photos you see online are probably taken using drones (see below, credits to the amazing Reagan Yip). It is quite difficult to fit yourself into the photo without sacrificing the view. The best photo spot, I learnt, is a balcony inside Exeter College, which is not open to the public. You can consider a low-angle shot - see the matriculation photo below for inspiration - as it captures the impressive Rad Cam whilst adding a tinge of creativity. Certainly a refreshing take on an extremely popular spot.\n\nIf you're a student, my honest take is: go somewhere else to study. The interior is gorgeous no doubt, and at some point you should visit this library at least once, but your Bod Card can get you to much nicer study spaces. To quote Robert Frost:\n\n“Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-\nI took the one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference.”",

As the menu stated, the mussels were incredibly fresh and creamy. They really whetted our appetites, and we couldn't stop eating! The duck leg was tender and flavorful. The most amazing part was the rösti underneath, which absorbed the orange sauce and made the dish even more incredible. The chocolate mousse was the perfect ending to our lunch.\n\nThe staff are polite and efficient. An excellent experience for our Oxford trip! Thank you!",

They had my name on the reservation but did not reserve a table so when we arrived we got whatever table was left.\n\nThe chairs and tables are small and wonky making it really difficult to eat as everything is almost falling out. Barely any space between tables and chairs back to back making your meal a ‘family' meal as we are so closed to other people you could reach their food with your fork.\n\nThe food wasn't anything special. Worse than that my ‘pink' steak was completely raw. Fries overcooked and very dark brown.\n\nTook 20 minutes to get our order and had to request twice to the waiters floating around. The bill equally the same time to wait.\n\nDo not recommend. Expensive and low quality products and terrible customer service.",

Not your usual pub fare, but it keeps things interesting. The food was decent overall, nothing amazing, but tasty enough.

The venue seems to want to crowd in as many people as possible so if you do make it to the bar be prepared to end up wearing most of your drink going back to the table area after fighting through the crowd. We would have spent much more at the bar if this was offered!\nEvery time I've been here the bouncer on the door seems reluctant to want to let you in!

Our guests arrived a little earlier than we did whilst we had a wonder round the city, but from the moment we arrived, the staff made us feel welcomed, providing a great atmosphere. The service made everything feel effortless, allowing us and our guests to relax and truly enjoy our special day. We had some bar snacks and bread tapas alongside our drinks which was fantastic to keep everyone going on a busy day.\n\nOne of the highlights was undoubtedly the cocktail river cruise. The cruise staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, adding to the stunning views of Oxford. Our family haven't stopped complimenting the cruise and it was loved by everyone, the blankets were a great touch as well!!\n\nIt was the perfect way to celebrate with our family and create unforgettable memories together - thank you!",

Some made the effort but not what you expect at a restaurant that was selling it self at this level. Food was mediocre. I had lamb that really didn't have a lot of flavour and croquets that were... out of a packet? Wine again was very mediocre.\nMichelin starred prices without the Michelin starred experience. Disappointing, will not be returning, not recommended by me.",
