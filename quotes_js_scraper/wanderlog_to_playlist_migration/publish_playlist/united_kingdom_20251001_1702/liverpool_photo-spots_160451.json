Other tables had the roast which looked yummy. So much to see and notice, easy to spend a few hours walking round. The volunteers\\staff are really friendly and knowledgeable, relying on donations. I bought a ticket for the tower in the shop. £7 was great value and it didn't seem like 108 steps as two lifts take you a long way up, and walking up looking down at the still bells makes you think! (I'm from Leeds so I haven't heard them) Staff member up the tower today was great, pointing buildings, areas, answering questions. Such a beautiful day, you can see for miles! Going back the opposite way down, lifts again to the cathedral. Really is worth the climb if you are able...",

It's soaring steeple ,which contributes to the Liverpool skyline, offers tours and brilliant views of the city. The church is free to enter, but to go to the top of the steeple is not. The shear scale of the cathedral is truly breathtaking featuring intricate and skilled designs. The interior of the building is equally as beautiful, with its large stain glass windows and carved stone arches. Of these arches, there is the ingenious whispering arch where the curvature of the archway allows for whispers to travel to the other side of the room. Finally, the church features a large gift shop and free toilets alongside its brilliant religious facilities. Overall, the church is definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.",

From the moment you step inside, you're greeted with a sense of grandeur-elegant halls, beautifully lit galleries, and a layout that allows each piece to breathe while still flowing seamlessly between periods and styles.\n\nThe permanent collection is impressive, ranging from classical works to Victorian masterpieces and striking contemporary pieces. It's a joy to wander through the different rooms, each revealing new textures, colours, and stories. I always find myself lingering a little longer than expected, drawn in by both familiar favourites and hidden gems.\n\nWhat I also truly appreciate are the occasional exhibitions. They bring a fresh energy to the space and offer new perspectives, often highlighting themes or artists that complement the main collection beautifully. These temporary displays feel thoughtfully curated and make each return visit feel like a new experience.\n\nThe building itself is just as inspiring as the art it holds-a stunning example of classical architecture that elevates the entire experience. Whether you're an art lover or simply curious, the Walker Art Gallery is a must-visit. It's a place where creativity, history, and beauty come together effortlessly.",

A restored Victorian green house that's like an oasis in the city, full of tropical plants and history. I've shot winter, summer and autumnal weddings here - some of them were icy, some were rainy, some were sunny, but all of them were joyous and beautiful. The venue has a bar area, a relaxing seated area and a main hall for dining and dancing. It looks amazing when the sun streams in but also equally amazing when it's lit up at nighttime. The park around it offers some incredible backdrops for couple portraits, especially the mini forest of super tall evergreen trees, merely 2 minutes walk from the venue. Sunsets are always epic here, being able to see the sky turn pink from your dinner table is just gorgeous. As a supplier I've always been welcomed and fed well, which makes such a difference to my day. Can't wait to shoot there again!",

The statue of the English Soldier + German Soldier - both with their own country uniforms BUT exactly the same face - should absolutely make you stop and think - we're not so very different from each other really are we?\nThese statues commemorating the shaking of hands - before their Christmas Day truce - engaging in a game of football - simply just young ordinary men before again the horrors of war continued.\nThe grounds are inviting, peaceful, serene with music playing and the opportunity to order food and drinks. A friendly place where people meet for lunch - take a break from sightseeing - just to BE. It's lovely and maybe we all feel that spirit of connection through ' The Handshake ' ENJOY",

The church's foundation was laid in 1811, and it was consecrated in 1831. It was designed by John Foster Sr. and his son, John Foster Jr., in a refined Gothic Revival style.\n​The church earned its nickname during the devastating Liverpool Blitz in May 1941. An incendiary bomb hit the church, causing a fire that gutted the building and destroyed the roof and interior, leaving only the exterior walls and tower intact. The tower clock stopped at 3:36 AM, a poignant reminder of the moment the bombing occurred.\n​Instead of being demolished, the shell of the church was preserved as a memorial to the civilian casualties of World War II. Since 2007, it has been managed as a community arts venue and a space for peace and reflection.\n\n​Opening Hours:\n​The church is generally open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. from April to September and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. from October to March, though these times can vary based on weather and scheduled events. It's recommended to check their official website for the latest updates. The gardens surrounding the church are typically open daily from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m.",

There were a lot of built displays such as the yellow submarine, the magical mystery bus, and clubs like the Cavern. Each exhibit has a number to correspond with the audio guided tour. Headphones and a handset are provided with the cost of entry. You don't need to worry about your phone losing battery or signal to hear all of the facts along the way.\nSigned memorabilia and Beatles merchandise is displayed throughout the museum. Original song lyrics written by the band and producers. Sgt Pepper and A Hard Days Night outfits are on display. Cartoon cells from The Yellow Submarine.\nThe audio guide was informative but a bit long winded at times. There is obviously Beatles music playing throughout the different exhibits to correspond with the display.\nEach member of the band has a specific section dedicated to their lives. There are actual instruments played by the Beatles and items they have owned.\nAt the end, there is a recreation of John Lennon and Yoko Ono's white room. A pair of Lennon's round framed eyeglasses sit atop a pedestal in the middle. Many of his sketches are hung on the walls. Great gift shop at the end. They have a small cafe with ready made items. The area is full of many other things to do so pay for parking and explore. Lots of restaurants, a shopping mall, and multiple activities (carousel, light show, etc).\nWe went on a Friday afternoon. Museum was relatively quiet. No wait to enter.",

The ticket includes the audio guide, which isn't just an enhancement, but a really essential part of the visit.  The audio guide tells the story of the Beatles as you move from room to room.  So it's a combination of recreations and memorabilia, organized in a way to walk you through their story.  I found it interesting and insightful.  We were there just over an hour, though your visit could be longer if you listened to every bonus video and feature on the audio guide.  Self-guided tour ends with a cafe and then a huge gift shop.  So glad we did this when visiting Liverpool.  It was different than anticipated, but in a good way!",

From the moment you step through its doors, you're whisked away on a nostalgic journey through the life, music, and legacy of the Fab Four.\n\nThe experience is masterfully immersive. Each exhibit feels like stepping into a time capsule-recreations of The Cavern Club, Abbey Road Studios, and even the psychedelic brilliance of Sgt. Pepper-era magic are all brought to life with authentic detail. The audio guide, narrated by those close to the band, adds depth and emotion, weaving personal anecdotes with historical insight.\n\nIt's more than a museum-it's a heartbeat of 60s culture, vibrating with Lennon's wit, McCartney's melodies, Harrison's soul, and Starr's rhythm. Rare memorabilia, original instruments, and poignant interviews paint a vivid portrait of four lads from Liverpool who changed the world.\n\nThe gift shop is a treasure trove for collectors, and the café offers the perfect spot to reflect while “Let It Be” plays softly in the background.\n\nWhether you're a lifelong fan or a curious newcomer, The Beatles Story is a must-visit. It's heartfelt, informative, and genuinely magical-a love letter to the band that made the world sing!",

This place is absolutely stunning.\n\nWith its circular design and towering crown-like spire, the cathedral stands boldly against the city skyline, a symbol of innovation and inclusivity. Step inside, and you're immediately wrapped in a kaleidoscope of colour and light. The stained-glass lantern ceiling is the star of the show-casting rich blues, reds, and golds that shift as the sun moves, bathing the interior in an ever-changing glow. It's both peaceful and electric.\n\nThe design encourages reflection without formality. There's space to wander, space to breathe, and space to be still. It's modern, yet deeply spiritual-minimalist, yet full of feeling.\n\nOutside, the open plaza is a social, sunlit space that invites visitors to sit, snap photos, or simply soak in the view of this architectural gem. It's a perfect spot to pause and admire how seamlessly the cathedral blends bold design with a strong sense of purpose.\n\nWhether you're into architecture, art, or serenity with a splash of colour-this cathedral will leave a lasting impression.\n\nOne negative, would be that we were not allowed to bring our small dog inside, even though it said on the website you could!!",

A warm welcome to look around given to ALL - free if charge - ( you can make a donation if you choose to).\nIt's ASTOUNDING - the architecture, the lighting, the colours, the statues - ACTUALLY EVERYTHING.\nTake time to look at each alcove dedicated to different things - THEN step back far enough away to take in also the opening above it - which seems to give completion! When I noticed that myself it was quite beautiful.\nThe 14 stages of Christ ( I think they are called) some a little 'gruesome' (for me) but absolutely spectacular art.\nThe organ pipes ( ask how many - wow) then see if you can spot where the organ is!!\nThis circular building is profoundly beautiful and for those who follow this faith - I just can't imagine how it must make you feel.\nThe crypts - another incredible space and well worth the £5 charge to visit.\nThere IS a sense of peace, of quiet within oneself - surrounded by all of this colour, shade, light and utter brilliance. Don't miss this from your visit. Don't be put off by a faith aspect - this incredible building and the people servicing it invite EVERYONE.",

Walking up the steps to the entrance, visitors can fully appreciate its presence. Inside, several separate chapels surround a large central space. The simple design and modern stained glass are very different to the gothic cathedrals of the past.\nThe cathedral is free to visit (donations welcomed) though a charge applies to see the Lutyens Crypt. It's a little bit of a walk from the city centre, but worth the effort to see such an unusual building. It's simplicity compared to ornately detailed gothic cathedrals of the past means it doesn't take long to fully explore.",

We'd originally went to Roxy Lanes to play a game of bowling, but at £10 per person, per game and with 3 of us looking to play, £30 felt like a rip off, so we ended up in Junkyard instead, and such a treat it ended up being!\n\nThe staff are incredibly friendly and accommodating. We paid £9.50 for 9 holes on the \"Gary\" Course. There was an option to pay £12.50 for unlimited games, however we only had time for 1 game as we were heading to the airport straight after but that felt like a really great price, expecially because the course we did was so much fun! Challenging enough but enjoyable.\n\nThere were 2 groups ahead of us, and we got chatting with the ones directly ahead and the group behind, which made the whole experience really friendly. People asked us to take photos and in turn, offered to take photos of us all too.\n\nI try to get to Liverpool once a year, and I'm so glad we tried Junkyard today, I'd definitely go back again next time I'm there!",

The entire street is a constantly evolving canvas bursting with color, creativity, and attitude. One of the absolute highlights is the stunning pair of angel wings painted against a dark wall – perfectly placed for that classic “I've ascended” photo op. It's almost a rite of passage to snap a pic there.\n\nFurther along the street, you'll find a powerful tribute to Jurgen Klopp, Liverpool's football messiah. It's more than just a mural – it's a love letter from the city to the man who brought them glory. But the art doesn't stop there. From psychedelic portraits to politically charged pieces, Jamaica Street delivers a mix of humor, rebellion, and raw talent.\n\nThe beauty is in the variety – no two visits are the same, as artists keep adding new layers to the urban story. Whether you're a tourist, a local, or a photographer on the hunt for inspiration, Jamaica Street is a bold, brilliant expression of Liverpool's creative soul. Get your camera ready – this is art you don't just look at, you experience.",

As someone who appreciates architectural details, I was immediately struck by the building's thoughtful layout and elegant features. The glass dome in particular is stunning-it floods the space with natural light, creating a calm and uplifting atmosphere that's perfect for reading or simply taking in your surroundings.\n\nFrom the upper floors, the view over the city is a quiet surprise. It adds a wonderful sense of openness, connecting the library to the world beyond its walls while still feeling like a peaceful retreat. Whether you're browsing books, studying, or just passing through, there's a sense of calm and quiet beauty throughout the building.\n\nWhat I also loved was the subtle use of colour-pops of warmth and brightness that soften the modern lines and give the space a welcoming, almost playful character. It's not just a place for books; it's a space that feels alive and well-loved.\n\nLiverpool Central Library is more than just a library-it's an architectural and cultural landmark that encourages curiosity and creativity at every turn.",

It was a lovely atmosphere - not very busy but a good few tables to create a fun vibe. The decor is STUNNING. Never seen a restaurant like it.\n\nMum ordered the salmon kebab and I had vegan lamb kofta. We also shared a cauliflower starter. The portion sizes were perfect - not too big but just enough. We also shared 2 bottles of wine.\nThe bill was reasonable - decent for what we had and the wine costing the most, but hey, it's a treat. Our waiter was charming, as were the rest of the staff.\nAll in all we both had a lovely evening and will be returning.",

In reality, I found it quite grubby, with dirty stairs, that looked like someone had swept the dirt into the corners. The toilets were grim and out of paper, and the taps felt like they needed a drop of WD40. The staff seemed busy and stressed, which was reflected in the poor service. You had to scan a QR code for a gluten-free 5, which is fine, but the starters weren't on, and it took two staff to finally bring out a cardboard menu. It took forever for the starters to arrive, I had the Korean fried chicken. This was lukewarm and tasteless. Whilst we were waiting forever for the mains, we ordered another bottle of wine that was dumped on the table by a staff member who walked off without opening it. Thankfully, another one noticed and went to get a corkscrew. Eventually, the mains arrived, I had a Thai Prawn hanging kebab. It was bland, and the prawns were barely warm with rice that was hot in some places and cold in others. I left most of it, though it did look nice.\nOverall, if you don't care about food and service and want to take some nice photos, this is the place. If you want decent food, go anywhere else.",
