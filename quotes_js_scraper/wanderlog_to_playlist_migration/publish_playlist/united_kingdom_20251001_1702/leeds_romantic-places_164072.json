It's a great day out for families, offering insight into the history and cultures of different parts of the world.\n\nOne downside is the café, which is on the pricey side. You might be better off walking down the road to find something more affordable to eat.\n\nOverall, a memorable and educational trip that's well worth the visit.",

The lakes, woodlands, and wide open green spaces make it perfect for walks, picnics, or just relaxing outdoors.\n\nWe spent a good few hours wandering around and still didn't see it all. The walk around Waterloo Lake was especially lovely, with ducks and swans, and loads of scenic spots to stop and take in the view. The Tropical World nearby is also well worth a visit if you've got kids or just fancy something a bit different.\n\nGreat facilities too – plenty of parking, clean toilets, and cafes dotted around for a coffee or snack. Whether you're local or just visiting Leeds, Roundhay Park is a must-see. A proper breath of fresh air right on the city's doorstep.",

We always loved going to different shows together, and I made a promise to her-to keep doing the things we loved, to keep living for the both of us.\n\nI watched Kinky Boots which was an absolute triumph – a show that's as bold and beautiful as it is moving and meaningful. From the moment the lights came up, I was completely captivated. The performances were phenomenal, the energy electric, and the story – oh, the story – struck right to the heart.\n\nAs a member of the LGBTQ community, this show resonated with me on such a personal level. I cried – not just at the emotional depth of the narrative, but because I saw parts of my own journey, as well as those of friends reflected on stage. The struggle for acceptance, the sting of rejection, the courage it takes to be unapologetically yourself – it was all there, handled with such authenticity, grace, and heart.\n\nBut what truly makes Kinky Boots so special is how it blends this deep emotional core with joy, humour, and hope. It's laugh-out-loud funny at times, wonderfully cheeky, and endlessly heartwarming. It reminds you that love, understanding, and acceptance really can change the world – one step at a time, in a fabulous pair of heels.\n\nThis wasn't just a show – it was a celebration of identity, resilience, and community. A standing ovation doesn't do it justice. If you have the chance to see it, do. It's a powerful, affirming, and unforgettable experience.\n\nSitting there alone was extremely painful, and I felt an overwhelming sadness when I arrived, missing my wife beside me so deeply. I cried quietly in the darkness, not just because of the show's moving moments, but because she wasn't there to share them.\n\nBut somehow, through the laughter, the music, and the message of hope and acceptance, the show gently lifted my spirits. It reminded me that joy can still be found, even through the grief, and for that, I'm truly grateful.\n\nThe cast of performers are fabulous! And the show made me miss going to drag shows with my sweet wife. We loved those!\n\nThe theatre itself is lovely. It has a real sense of character. Its period features and traditional charm give it a warm, welcoming feel, and the architecture adds a touch of elegance to the whole experience. The kind of place that adds to the enjoyment of the evening without overshadowing the performance itself.\n\nOverall, a fantastic experience.\n\nI've even booked myself a ticket to the Sounds of 60s show! And yes, alone but I can do this!",

They took our Drink and food order all in one go, The food arrived and we're just about finished our first drink. So we re-ordered the same drink order.\nThat never arrived, When we finished our food, I waved to somebody and said that our second drinks had not arrived, The lady couldn't of been any nicer, Very apologetic and said she would go get our drinks, She come back and said there was never ordered, We had finished our food, so we said never mind so we didn't have the second drink.\nWe was never asked if we wanted anything, We wasn't asked if the food was okay, The place was very full, In my opinion, not enough stuff on. Just need someone at the front of the house making sure everybody is okay with drinks, And if everybody's meal is okay.\nAnd some of the staff smelt of BO so they should take that into account when Serving food.",

The place looks amazing - the decoration is beautiful and the whole vibe is perfect for a nice evening out (and great for photos too!).\n\nThe food was delicious, full of flavour and really well presented. But what made the whole experience even better was the service. Everyone was super friendly and welcoming, and they paid attention to all the little details without being over the top.\n\nShout out to Millie, who looked after us, she was fantastic. She knew the menu really well and took the time to explain things and make sure we felt comfortable with our choices. Really appreciated how patient and helpful she was.\n\nAll in all, it was a lovely experience and definitely good value for money. Would absolutely recommend and can't wait to go back!",

The tropical house has so much to see and is far bigger than I ever expected.\nThe only negative I have to mention is a lot of the glass in the tanks is quite dirty so it can be hard to see the fish but I imagine this isn't an easy job to clean. This aside, we loved everything about it and will definitely be back.\nThe price is brilliant and even better if you have a max card, 1 adult goes free and under 3's are free too!\nWe ate in the cafe and food was freshly prepared and tasty, price wise I don't think it was too bad for what you got. Lots of space to eat and you can enjoy your own food in the outside picnic area!\nWe will definitely visit again.",

Would be helpful to have clearer guides/signs along the way for those with visual impairment (route directions, entry & exit signs between the different areas, high contrast on level changes). Café was nice; good variety of food at good prices, plenty of space around tables and lovely outdoor seating (two areas, one overlooking gardens). Would recommend",

We are museum geeks, visiting many. This was one of the best. The first floor with the animals, was lovely to see them inside glass protection. You could do a 180 to see all angles, get a real feel of there beauty. There was lots of interaction areas for younger children, my daughter is 12 still enjoyed this experience. As you climb the stairs/floors there was so many wonderful interest different topics. It was a really enjoyable experience, we went as a family , we all enjoyed it. You could easily spend a couple of hours taking in all the marvels. It truly was a surprise inside, do pay this museum a visit. It is tidy, clean & orderly.

The course was exciting and well laid out, and the staff were incredibly friendly, helpful, and supportive throughout, especially on the more challenging sections. A big shout out to Alexandra for encouragement and help on the Tarzi swing – you were amazing! Also, thank you to the gentleman who assisted with the Plummet (sorry I didn't catch your name!) – your support made all the difference in combating the challenging zips.\n\nMy daughter and I really loved every moment of it. Car parking at the location is fairly priced, and they provide handy baskets to keep your keys and belongings safe while you're on the course. Toilets are only a short walk away, A great day out and wonderful memories made!",

Their menu changes too.\n\nDidn't have to prebook if you come 6pm, I guess it's early dinner, plenty seats. Great service, waiter gave good recommendations and very friendly, enjoyed our time there very much.\n\nMy favourite was the ox heart with oyster sauce, it was an interesting texture that almost didn't taste like heart (I've had chicken heart before) and the oyster sauce was creamy with a hint of oyster, I really enjoy the natural flavour of the ingredients, they were paired and chosen well.\n\nThe mutton kofta itself was a bit tough and salty and in my opinion would've been better medium rare. The cherry tomatoes came with it were the best I've had, juicy and good balance of sweet and sour.\n\nThe medium rare steak with pepper sauce was great too, we ordered fries on the side. Again the pepper sauce was excellent, it had a spicy kick to it, I'd buy all of their sauces. Steak was done well too.\n\nThe basque cheesecake was ok, standard good cake, not too sweet.",

            "text": "I completely understand the restaurant has changed ownership from Bulgogi Grill to now Mommy Mookrata and went into the experience with an open mind, however was sorely disappointed.\n\nQuality of meat was poor. Opted for the beef mixed set only to find the beef grisly and chewy. The broth on the hotpot was relatively flavourless and beyond that the beef itself was plain. The mixed sets come with three dipping sauces of which were just fine, though not to my taste personally. I had to ask for a bowl of plain soy sauce as this didn't come as standard. To add I spent the entire meal with steam from the hotpot blowing in my face as it wasn't picked up by the extractor fan.\n\nGrill was not oiled and so the meat would burn and charr whilst being raw all at the same time, it was almost impressive to see. No oil on the grill made it hard to cook the meat as it would just stick to it, and again the only alternative was the flavourless hotpot broth.\n\nThe service was fine. For a “soft launch” opening of restaurant I would've hoped for a bit more enthusiasm or charisma, but it just felt cold. There was a QR code to scan to access the menu however the website it led to was full of pop ups and adverts making it very slow to load and hard to navigate, if you clicked the wrong link I'm sure a virus would've downloaded on your phone.\n\nQuality of food was subpar. Order a fried rice dish, rice was mushy and overcooked, this was alongside the beef mixed set which again had grisly chewy beef. Only available cutlery is chopsticks making some of the food hard to eat for those who aren't familiar with using them.\n\nTo top it all off it was cash only. This was never advertised, not on their website, not on their social media, nowhere. We were only told AFTER eating our meal. We didn't have any cash on us and the ATM outside of the restaurant was broken so had to pay via bank transfer. Transfer was directed to a personal account, not a business account, which I found quite sneaky. Staff showed us a screenshot on his phones photo album with details of where to send payment to, again just very shoddy unprofessional business, especially as cash only was not advertised anywhere at all.\n\nWon't be going again. If you were a fan of Bulgogi Grill, save your money and don't bother. It's a different restaurant now, part of the Mommy Thai chain which is just sad. No heart or soul anymore. I can forgive teething issues for a new restaurant opening, but this whole experience left a literal bad taste in my mouth.",

We went into “Mommy Mookrata” with the expectations of Bulgogi grill but the option of hotpot (THIS IS NOT THE CASE)\n\nTHE MENU - Menu has completely changed, it's abysmal. Before you would pay for the meats and you would get unlimited sides etc, now you have to either order a set menu like before with ONE PORTION of each side or BUY INDIVIDUAL MEATS/SIDES. Which at first doesn't sound too bad right? WRONG - It's £4.50 for Lettuce leafs which counted as the portion size is drastically different (YOU GET 8 LEAFS) and £3.00 for RICE which is also SMALLER portion.\n\nThere's no draft beer, only small 330ml bottles, soju was sold out AND they no longer sell the yellow radish (which is in their kimbab) so it's either they dont care what their customers want OR it's no longer homemade kimbab :|\n\nThis place used to be my go-to and now I doubt we'll be going back again. BUT one thing I want to make sure the owners of this restaurant know is that there staff is genuinely one of the only redeeming parts of your restaurant now so hopefully you will understand this isn't on them, it's on you for selling out.\n\nPrice for this was £44.95 See pictures below",

The incorporation of golf themes on the pool tables is innovative and particularly appreciated the holes where the balls had launch points to power up, one of these leads to the second half of a hole essentially which was a neat touch. One hole has multiple holes on the way to the one we need to score in which is a unique challenge, enjoyed a Coke here too!",

We chatted a little and he asked whether we were celebrating anything, and we told him that it was my birthday and that was our reason for being in Leeds. We explained we are only having a small plate because we have a meal booked later in the day. The food we had was amazing, I highly recommend the crab starter, it's definitely a special dish. We finished our food and asked for the bill. Next, Jack walks over with a desert with a candle in it And it had a little chocolate saying happy birthday on it. I was over the moon and it made my day. I want to thank you so much for your kindness and amazing service. Jack is a credit to the Restaurant (which is absolutely stunning). A Service like this Is memorable for all the right reasons and I will probably never forget his kindness 🩷🩷🩷",

The restaurant is beautiful, perfect for a special occasion. I had the prix fixe menu with duck salad, sea bass, side of mashed potatoes and crème brûlée - all delicious. One of my daughters had the same but chose the chocolate bombe, which was amazing too. Service was top-notch, our server was lovely and super attentive. Even the bathrooms were pretty!

The rib-eye on the bone was cooked to perfection, boasting a rich, tender flavor that truly stood out. Paired with the truffle and parmesan chips, which were crispy, indulgent, and packed with flavor, it was a memorable dish. The ambiance of the restaurant was elegant and sophisticated, with a welcoming atmosphere that made the meal even more enjoyable. To top it all off, the service was attentive and friendly, ensuring a seamless dining experience. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a top-notch meal! It was a pricey meal as you have to buy sides separately and the drinks could have been slightly better for the price but that would be my only criticisms.",

They also moved us to a preferred table when we asked.\n\nHowever, I personally wasn't overly impressed with the food.\nSadly, two starters weren't available so I went with a third choice of mussels in a garlic and white wine sauce. I think that's a boring dish anyway no matter where you get it from, but the majority of the mussels were out of the sauce so I had to make my way through a few before I could dip them in.\n\nThe braised beef cheek was melt in your mouth tender. Excellently cooked.\nGenerous portion too, but it's a cheap cut of meat so I'd expect that for the price. The flavour was rustic but lacking in anything that got me excited for my next bite. I actually got a bit bored of eating it.  However, to be completely honest, I find beef pretty boring unless it's a steak cut or a burger. Therefore my review is very subjective in that regard and I'd recommend trying it for yourself.\n\nMy partner really enjoyed her starter and it was well presented. She liked the beef cheek more than me but she seemed to get my portion of garlic in hers.\n\nSo in terms of food rating, we've given it 4 stars to meet in the middle.\n\nI would definitely go to this restaurant again, but I would try the lamb and a different starter.",

I genuinely appreciated her kindness and don't want to take that away from her at all. She was a real highlight of the visit.\n\nHowever, I was really disappointed by the overall response when we asked for photos. As it was my birthday (and a friend's birthday was coming up too), we just wanted to capture some special moments. Unfortunately, the team made us feel like we were asking for too much. Hazel, in particular, was unfriendly and abrupt from the start and didn't create a welcoming atmosphere.\n\nEven at the end, when we asked for a group photo with what we had painted, Emily said we had to be quick because another group was coming. She took the photo carelessly, and my friend-who was also celebrating-was cropped out. That really upset me. While I truly appreciated Emily's warmth throughout the session, I didn't feel like she made an effort in that final moment, which mattered a lot to us.\n\nIt's a lovely place for a casual activity, and there's plenty to choose from creatively-but I wouldn't recommend it for a special occasion. The way we were made to feel, particularly around something as simple as taking a photo, took away from what should have been a joyful experience.",
