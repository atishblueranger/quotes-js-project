Nearby, the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art and Sage Gateshead add cultural weight to the experience, while the Quayside buzzes with cafés and market stalls.\n\nWhether you're drawn by its engineering or its elegance, the Millennium Bridge offers a moment of quiet connection-between cities, between people, and between past and future.",

It's a beautiful building, really impressive inside. The stained glass is gorgeous, and some really interesting sculptures and art. There's a new churchyard trail and landscaped terrace, providing a sanctuary to unwind.\nI was just wandering around, snapping photos, and soaking it all in. I overheard a tour guide who was excellent and made the history of the cathedral extremely interesting. You can easily spend an hour or two just wandering around, checking everything out. They have a shop and a café.\nIt's a welcoming space, with friendly staff and volunteers.
