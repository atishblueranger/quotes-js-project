It was easily accessible by train and bus and very well placed. Excellent architectural design and detail, professional, welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable staff, amazing theatre auditorium. Available spaces for eating and drinking and lounges during intermission. Don't forget to check out the theatre gift shoppe for some interesting items. If not busy, the helpful staff can tell you more about the theatre and give you info about their theatre tour offerings. Tips: the ground floor toilets could get very crowded with long queues so try to get there early enough. If you need temporary storage for your bags/luggage, there's  a Premier Inn just across the road (via the Stasher app). Hot drinks not allowed inside the theatre for safety reasons. If you need a quick charge your phone, there is a table in the dining area near area A with sockets.",

All doors to where the punters sit to watch performances were locked. I asked a member of staff if I could have a look but he refused. I joked that what I'd seen so far was so good it could've been built in England. Lead balloon time. Lighten up little Welsh man, okay, you weren't amused but a deafening silence would've been better than the response you gave. Coming over the border? Don't. We'll sing you away.

The distinctive design creates an immediate sense of anticipation, and the location in Cardiff Bay couldn't be more perfect. The waterfront setting adds to the overall experience, making a visit feel like a special occasion.\n\nWhat truly sets this venue apart is the theatre itself. The comfort level is exceptional - genuinely the most comfortable live theatre experience I've encountered. The seating is thoughtfully designed, allowing you to focus entirely on the performance without any distractions from cramped conditions or poor sightlines.\n\nThe technical aspects are flawless. Both the acoustics and visibility are outstanding, ensuring every seat in the house offers an excellent experience. During \"The Book of Mormon,\" every word was crystal clear and every visual detail was perfectly visible, which is exactly what you want from a musical production.\n\nEven the gift shop deserves recognition. Rather than the typical tourist fare, they offer unique and lovely items that feel special. The staff were genuinely friendly and helpful, adding to the overall positive experience.\n\nThe Wales Millennium Centre delivers on every level - from its stunning architecture and prime location to its superior comfort and technical excellence. It's a venue that enhances any performance, making it a true cultural jewel in Cardiff Bay. Highly recommended for anyone seeking a top-tier theatre experience.",

For the art lovers, the museum also offers a good art collection. There is a souvenir shop, and a cafe if you wanted to grab something. In all, I think i spent over 2 hours going through everything. Admission is free, but do remember to make a nice donation in the boxes all over the museum",

The layout was simple and easy to follow, every exhibit was marked with a brief description & history.\n\nWhat I loved most of all was how child friendly Cardiff Museum is. There were a number of stools for children to sit down, view and take notes if they preferred. In some displays there were artifacts  like hats, caps, puzzles, etc that the children could use and have fun.\n\nA really good place to visit and it's free to enter.",

Such a nice place to have locally.\n\nLovely selection of food and drink throughout the day and a calm environment when I visited. Had their flat white and their passion and coconut cake. Moist and fruity cake. Absolutely no notes. Delicious.\n\nCoffee was much nicer than the stuff you get at a big coffee chain spot thanks to them using Hard Line Coffee, a local roaster, as their bean supplier.\n\nI will be sure to come back to try the cinema soon :)",

It arrived with smoke on top, which added to the beautiful presentation and flavour, tasting like a burst of umami. We also had the Kohlrabi Som Tam as a side, which was refreshing, contrasting the rich meaty flavours of the steak and porkchop.\n\nFor meats, we had a 200g Sirloin and a Porkchop. Both meats were dry-aged, the sirloin being beautifully seared with a nice crust, the inside being perfectly pink. Every bite was tender and juicy, and I was able to feel the charcoal flavour. We didn't use the garlic butter (one of the few sauces provided on the menu) as our steak philosophy is that a good steak doesn't need sauce to bring out flavour.\n\nThe porkchop was brilliant alongside the steak, with a sweet brown sauce that was rich in flavour. The cherry on top was the pork rinds, perfectly accompanying the bold flavours of the porkchop.\n\nAlongside the delightful meal was a cozy atmosphere, and I think the window in the dry aging rack was an interesting feature, the customers being able to view meats being dry-aged in real life.\n\nOverall, the meal was delicious and the service from Lin was amazing, one of the best restaurants in Cardiff!",

It costs £1500 per day to keep the cathedral running so they do ask for donations and we certainly contributed. It is a beautiful cathedral and worth visiting. Sadly people have vandalized many of the marble effigies. The stained glass windows are beautiful. The organ immense. The cathedral has several small chapels in it including the RRW chapel and the Mary Chapel. Visit and support this wonderful cathedral and piece of Welsh history! A short walk from the cathedral are wonderful hiking trails.",

If you are happy spending a lot on food while trying some new games out before you invest it is a nice place to come occasionally.\n\nThey do also do table service which if you've got a big group is inevitably tricky mathing at the end when everyone orders different bits over several hours. So you might prefer to pay for what you order when you do at the bar to save the faff later.\n\nIt is dog friendly though, so if you have a four legged friend that is good and the tables are really roomy underneath so they'll have plenty of space to settle out of the way.",

The cafe is clearly geared towards board game enthusiasts who appreciate a quieter atmosphere, which is understandable. However, it also serves food and drinks, which can create a bit of a conflict when a larger group like ours is added to the mix.\n\nDespite this, we had a great time exploring their huge selection of board games. There was something for everyone, with games of all types and durations. The food and drinks were also a hit, especially the dirty shakes (milkshakes with alcohol). They were so good I had two! Although, at £12 each, they were a bit pricey. I guess the cost helps to cover the board games, but it's something to keep in mind.\n\nThe staff were great, despite having to ask us to keep the noise down several times and clearly a little distressed at time, they didn't really show it.\n\nHelpful hints and tips:\n•\tIf you're with a larger group, especially a stag or hen party, it might be worth calling ahead to see if they can accommodate you in a more secluded area.\n•\tBe prepared to pay a bit more for the food and drinks, but consider it an investment in the entertainment.\n•\tTake your time to browse the game selection - there are some real gems to discover!",

It's a great place to relax and chill with friends whilst playing darts and drinking and eating. You're greeted by a host who will explain the process and you're allocated a spacious area for you to play. It's not the usual darts rules as there are multiple playing modes to choose from. By pressing a button there is a table service where someone will take your order - there is a service charge when paying the bill. We had a good pizza and soft drinks, which I feel isn't indicative of the quality of the food. When our playing time ended we were offered a free extra 15 minutes which we declined as we didn't have enough time. Shoutout to Randal the host, smiley, polite and did a great job explaining everything to us and giving us a warm welcome! A real credit to the team. Overall a great place to chill with friends whilst relaxing over games of darts.",

Each provided a chapter in a small book, \"What lurks beneath the shadows\"\nA truly fun and memorable experience.

We weren't around 5-6 times.\nThe guy who took us out and looked after us was a top bloke from Australia (sadly I can't remember his name) but he was great, we had so much fun and he really got involved with our silly, immature girly nature's. He was encouraging but also respectful of individuals limitations.\nThank you so much.\nStacey",

Booked in for Axe throwing, darts and shuffle board.\nWent for an 12pm -3pm slots doing one activity after another.\nI'd say midday day is a nice calmer time to visit and especially on a Sunday, perfect for younger family members.\nWe were greeted by Nick got the waivers sorted for axe throwing and straight over to that activity.\nAxe throwing is great fun, Nick talked through the ways to throw, demonstrated and was a good laugh. Even though my partner split an axe handle with another axe he made light of it although on the second time he done it we were taking bets if it happened a third how much a new axe set costs.\nNick was professional and fun and a great instructor if you can request people.\nOn to the other activities asked if we had played before (which we had), we were left to our own devices and had great fun again.\nOrdered drinks and food with a table near by. Prices as expected for these type of places and food was lovely. Great as a light snack or a few dishes to share.\n\nWe used vouchers which were bought for us last Christmas and made a great outing and would suggest the vouchers if people are stuck for present ideas.\n\nAlso just for reference I done axe throwing at 27 weeks pregnant. I emailed ahead of activities to check if this was okay and checked with midwife which is completely fine, all being feeling able enough and healthy.",

Clean & plenty to do. Lots of animals and a huge indoor play centre that looked great so you can spend the whole day to get value for money.\n\nMy little boy is almost 3 and loved it, we'll definitely be back.\n\nThe coffee and cake(s) were lovely, we also bought a few bits from the farm shop on the way out. I really appreciate local goods being sold so that was great as I didn't know there was a farm shop. I'd seen comments that the food there is expensive, but personally didn't think it was too bad when looking at the menu while getting coffee. Maybe not as cheap as some play centres but I can't comment more as we didn't buy them.\nPicnics are allowed on picnic benches outside and not in the cafe area.\n\nAlso thanks to the social media team, I messaged the evening before to ask what sort of food is served as I couldn't see anything online and had an informative reply quickly even though it was out of typical office hours.\n\nWe bought tickets in advance as it was Easter weekend so thought that would be best. There were some Easter activities going on which was lovely too.\n\nThere are additional costs for the train ride and a few other things but the train was only £3 per person which if you have a little one that likes trains isn't too bad. You can purchase tickets online with your entry, at the entrance and at the train station before getting on (card accepted).",

We coupled this with some beer and wine.\n\nJohn, our waiter, was super friendly, helpful and knowledgable about the food and wine. Made us feel really welcome and was on hand through the meal when we wanted more.\n\nWe then ordered a round of hot and cold tapas. The standouts were the chorizo which was sooo soft. The mushrooms were also immense. Loved them. Wanted more! All the dishes were great. The calamari's was a little dry and maybe needed a dip with it but it was a small footnote.\n\nReally enjoyed the meal and would 100% go back again.",
