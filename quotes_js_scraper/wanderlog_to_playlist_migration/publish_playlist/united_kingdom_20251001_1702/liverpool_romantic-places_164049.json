Other tables had the roast which looked yummy. So much to see and notice, easy to spend a few hours walking round. The volunteers\\staff are really friendly and knowledgeable, relying on donations. I bought a ticket for the tower in the shop. £7 was great value and it didn't seem like 108 steps as two lifts take you a long way up, and walking up looking down at the still bells makes you think! (I'm from Leeds so I haven't heard them) Staff member up the tower today was great, pointing buildings, areas, answering questions. Such a beautiful day, you can see for miles! Going back the opposite way down, lifts again to the cathedral. Really is worth the climb if you are able...",

It's soaring steeple ,which contributes to the Liverpool skyline, offers tours and brilliant views of the city. The church is free to enter, but to go to the top of the steeple is not. The shear scale of the cathedral is truly breathtaking featuring intricate and skilled designs. The interior of the building is equally as beautiful, with its large stain glass windows and carved stone arches. Of these arches, there is the ingenious whispering arch where the curvature of the archway allows for whispers to travel to the other side of the room. Finally, the church features a large gift shop and free toilets alongside its brilliant religious facilities. Overall, the church is definitely worth a visit if you are in the area.",

Everything is so well curated, the building and staff are wonderful.\n\nWe absolutely need to return to take in more information.",

            "text": "The Museum of Liverpool may not immediately dazzle with flashy theatrics, but for anyone fascinated by history, it's a real treasure trove. As the first national museum devoted to the story of a regional city, its purpose-built building on Pier Head presents Liverpool's past in a smart, contemporary setting.\n\nInside, the museum is organized into four major thematic galleries: The Great Port, Global City, People's Republic, and Wondrous Place. These cover everything from Liverpool's role in maritime trade and the empire, to its diverse communities, culture, migration, and urban development – spanning a timeline from prehistoric times to the present day. With over 6,000 objects on show, paired with interactive sections like History Detectives and the Little Liverpool play area for under‑6s, it's both educational and engaging.\n\nFor history-buffs, the highlight is definitely the well-curated storytelling of Liverpool's global influence, technological growth, and multicultural heritage. While it may lack the visual impact of larger museums, its depth and context are what make it stand out.\n\nA particular gem is the top-floor sports gallery, featuring exhibits and archives on football and other local sporting traditions, alongside multimedia displays celebrating the city's sporting heritage . It's a fitting tribute to Liverpool's sporting culture and proves that even in a history museum, sports can play a starring role.\n\nOverall impression\n\nNot a flashy museum, but rich, thoughtfully curated, and highly rewarding for history enthusiasts.\nClean, modern building with a logical layout across three public floors.\nThe sports gallery on the top floor adds a dynamic touch and is well worth visiting.\nIdeal for those who appreciate Liverpool's complex story-from maritime prowess to urban identity.\nIf you're drawn to the narrative behind the city-its people, international connections, and evolving social fabric-this museum delivers an insightful and memorable experience.",

One highlight for me was an exhibit featuring the different birds that once contended for the right to be associated with the city's name-I had a good laugh there.\nMy mum and I spent about two hours exploring, and still didn't manage to see everything. It's definitely the kind of place you can return to time and again, always leaving with something new learned.",

There were a lot of built displays such as the yellow submarine, the magical mystery bus, and clubs like the Cavern. Each exhibit has a number to correspond with the audio guided tour. Headphones and a handset are provided with the cost of entry. You don't need to worry about your phone losing battery or signal to hear all of the facts along the way.\nSigned memorabilia and Beatles merchandise is displayed throughout the museum. Original song lyrics written by the band and producers. Sgt Pepper and A Hard Days Night outfits are on display. Cartoon cells from The Yellow Submarine.\nThe audio guide was informative but a bit long winded at times. There is obviously Beatles music playing throughout the different exhibits to correspond with the display.\nEach member of the band has a specific section dedicated to their lives. There are actual instruments played by the Beatles and items they have owned.\nAt the end, there is a recreation of John Lennon and Yoko Ono's white room. A pair of Lennon's round framed eyeglasses sit atop a pedestal in the middle. Many of his sketches are hung on the walls. Great gift shop at the end. They have a small cafe with ready made items. The area is full of many other things to do so pay for parking and explore. Lots of restaurants, a shopping mall, and multiple activities (carousel, light show, etc).\nWe went on a Friday afternoon. Museum was relatively quiet. No wait to enter.",

The ticket includes the audio guide, which isn't just an enhancement, but a really essential part of the visit.  The audio guide tells the story of the Beatles as you move from room to room.  So it's a combination of recreations and memorabilia, organized in a way to walk you through their story.  I found it interesting and insightful.  We were there just over an hour, though your visit could be longer if you listened to every bonus video and feature on the audio guide.  Self-guided tour ends with a cafe and then a huge gift shop.  So glad we did this when visiting Liverpool.  It was different than anticipated, but in a good way!",

From the moment you step through its doors, you're whisked away on a nostalgic journey through the life, music, and legacy of the Fab Four.\n\nThe experience is masterfully immersive. Each exhibit feels like stepping into a time capsule-recreations of The Cavern Club, Abbey Road Studios, and even the psychedelic brilliance of Sgt. Pepper-era magic are all brought to life with authentic detail. The audio guide, narrated by those close to the band, adds depth and emotion, weaving personal anecdotes with historical insight.\n\nIt's more than a museum-it's a heartbeat of 60s culture, vibrating with Lennon's wit, McCartney's melodies, Harrison's soul, and Starr's rhythm. Rare memorabilia, original instruments, and poignant interviews paint a vivid portrait of four lads from Liverpool who changed the world.\n\nThe gift shop is a treasure trove for collectors, and the café offers the perfect spot to reflect while “Let It Be” plays softly in the background.\n\nWhether you're a lifelong fan or a curious newcomer, The Beatles Story is a must-visit. It's heartfelt, informative, and genuinely magical-a love letter to the band that made the world sing!",

It makes such a beautiful backdrop for couple, bridal party, family & confetti photos. When it's raining, the covered area with the large pillars is a great place to take a couple for their photos too. It's also easy to walk round the corner to William Brown Street that has the trees lining the street, as well as other amazing sandstone buildings, such as Walker Art Gallery, County Sessions House and the Public Library.",

From the moment you step inside, you're greeted with a warm and inviting atmosphere, and the tantalizing aroma of perfectly cooked beef fills the air.\nI recently had the pleasure of dining here, and it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The menu is straightforward, focusing on high-quality cuts of beef cooked to perfection. I opted for the ribeye, and it was cooked exactly as I requested – beautifully seared on the outside with a succulent and tender pink center. The flavor was rich and beefy, exactly what you crave.\nThe sides were equally impressive. The chunky chips were crisp on the outside and fluffy inside, and the garlic mushrooms were bursting with flavor. They also offer a selection of delicious sauces to complement your steak.\nBeyond the incredible food, the service was outstanding. Our server was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable about the different cuts of meat and offered helpful recommendations. The staff clearly take pride in what they do, and it shows.\nThe ambiance is also worth noting.

This is the time when we almost used up all of the provided sauce which is a sign that the steak itself is not great. I had higher hopes given the very high rating but now I am disappointed.",

From the moment you step inside, you're greeted with a sense of grandeur-elegant halls, beautifully lit galleries, and a layout that allows each piece to breathe while still flowing seamlessly between periods and styles.\n\nThe permanent collection is impressive, ranging from classical works to Victorian masterpieces and striking contemporary pieces. It's a joy to wander through the different rooms, each revealing new textures, colours, and stories. I always find myself lingering a little longer than expected, drawn in by both familiar favourites and hidden gems.\n\nWhat I also truly appreciate are the occasional exhibitions. They bring a fresh energy to the space and offer new perspectives, often highlighting themes or artists that complement the main collection beautifully. These temporary displays feel thoughtfully curated and make each return visit feel like a new experience.\n\nThe building itself is just as inspiring as the art it holds-a stunning example of classical architecture that elevates the entire experience. Whether you're an art lover or simply curious, the Walker Art Gallery is a must-visit. It's a place where creativity, history, and beauty come together effortlessly.",

Loud atmosphere but didn't really bother us, food was great if a little slow to come and the service was lovely, very friendly and helpful staff!

A restored Victorian green house that's like an oasis in the city, full of tropical plants and history. I've shot winter, summer and autumnal weddings here - some of them were icy, some were rainy, some were sunny, but all of them were joyous and beautiful. The venue has a bar area, a relaxing seated area and a main hall for dining and dancing. It looks amazing when the sun streams in but also equally amazing when it's lit up at nighttime. The park around it offers some incredible backdrops for couple portraits, especially the mini forest of super tall evergreen trees, merely 2 minutes walk from the venue. Sunsets are always epic here, being able to see the sky turn pink from your dinner table is just gorgeous. As a supplier I've always been welcomed and fed well, which makes such a difference to my day. Can't wait to shoot there again!",

We've had so many comments about how stunning the building was - we're glad it was a somewhat overcast day so it wasn't too hot inside! The team were also fantastic, from navigating complications over that weekend to being genuinely lovely people who were so excited for us, it really felt like the people were an important part of our day celebrating with us too.

It's incredibly moving and thoughtfully presented, offering a powerful glimpse into the ship's history, its connection to Liverpool, and the human stories behind the tragedy. The artifacts and interactive displays really bring the history to life.\n\nThe museum's layout is easy to navigate, and the staff are always friendly and knowledgeable.

Jane was absolutely fantastic, knew tiny little details and interesting facts. We explored the course, into McCoys, Stands, the Parade Ring, the Weighing Rooms, across to Red Rum's grave and a close up walk to the water jump. There was so much memorabilia (silks, trophies, tack). The tour overran by over an hour but that's because the group didn't want it to be over!  Jane has all the time in the world for us. I would happily book this again in a heartbeat. We could take as many photos as we wanted.\n\nTiny disappointment that we wasn't allowed access to the stables on this date as there was a dressage competition, understandable but still a tiny disappointment out of Jane's control. She did try but the stable manager refused access due to horses coming and going to the equestrian centre.\n\nHighly recommend to anyone with an interest!",

We escaped with just 25 seconds to spare-no zombies got us this time!\n\nWe were so impressed that we came back a second time and did Facility, with Jess as our game master. Just like Alex, Jess was amazing-super friendly, helpful, and clearly passionate about the experience. This room was a bit tougher than the first, and we're grateful Jess gave us a little extra time to get through it!\n\nWe'll definitely be back next time we're in Liverpool to try out the rest of the rooms-hopefully with Alex or Jess guiding us again.

This vibrant and entertaining guided bus tour takes you on a journey through the band's incredible history, visiting iconic locations that played a key role in their lives and careers.\n\nThe tour departs from the Albert Dock and immediately sets a fun tone with the colorful, psychedelic bus that mirrors the artwork from the famous Magical Mystery Tour album. The moment you hop on, the Beatles soundtrack begins, and you're immersed in their music and legacy.\n\nOver the course of around two hours, the tour covers key locations such as Penny Lane, Strawberry Field, the childhood homes of John, Paul, George, and Ringo, as well as places referenced in their lyrics. The guide on our tour was knowledgeable, engaging, and added plenty of fun trivia and personal stories that made the experience feel unique and lively.\n\nThe pace was comfortable, with short stops to step out and take photos at major spots. One highlight was stopping at Penny Lane, where everyone took turns posing by the street sign while “Penny Lane” played on the speakers - a magical moment for fans.\n\nThe tour concludes at the legendary Cavern Club, where visitors can enjoy live music and soak in even more Beatles atmosphere. Entry is included in the ticket, which is a great bonus.\n\nThe entire experience was well-organized and offered a great balance of music, storytelling, and sightseeing. Whether you're a lifelong Beatles fan or just curious about Liverpool's cultural heritage, this tour offers a nostalgic, informative, and very enjoyable ride.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone wanting to walk - or ride - in the footsteps of the Fab Four!",

Our guide, Neil, was incredibly knowledgeable and entertaining – he brought the Beatles' story to life with brilliant energy and humour. Dennis, our driver, was also fantastic – navigating the city smoothly while the Beatles' tunes played in the background, creating the perfect atmosphere.\n\nWe learned so many interesting and lesser-known facts about the Fab Four and their lives growing up in Liverpool. The stops were well-planned, and it was amazing to see the real-life places behind the lyrics and legacy.\n\nHighly recommend this tour to any Beatles fan or anyone interested in Liverpool's musical history. A truly magical experience – thank you, Neil and Dennis!",

Wow, they truly live up to the name. Sipping tea and nibbling on delicious sandwiches and cakes with the whole of Liverpool spread out beneath you is an experience you won't soon forget.\nThe food itself was delightful. The sandwiches were fresh and flavorful, and the selection of cakes and pastries was both beautiful and tasty. The scones were warm and crumbly, just as they should be, and the accompanying jam and clotted cream were perfect.",

The experience was both educational and breathtaking, offering stunning panoramic views of Liverpool from the top of this iconic landmark.\n\nOur guide was absolutely fantastic-she was not only knowledgeable but also incredibly friendly and engaging. Her passion for the history of the building and the city was evident, and she made the tour even more enjoyable with her insightful stories and warm personality. It was clear she had a deep understanding of Liverpool's heritage, and her enthusiasm was contagious!\n\nThe multimedia exhibition and the clock tower visit were definite highlights, giving a unique perspective on this historic site. I highly recommend this tour to anyone visiting Liverpool-whether you're a local or a tourist, it's a must-see!",

Secondly the 124 steps climb are not a problem, you stop twice on the way up and one time for a 10 min audio/visual, so all good if you worry about the climb.\nLastly, before we get to views, the tour guides are great and add so much to the experience, with knowledge and passion about building and Liverpool!\nThe main event of the views from both levels didn't disappoint! I would recommend a nice sunny day with little wind for a visit, but good luck with that with the British weather being what it is!\nOverall well worth a visit",

The tour starts down steps on Water Street and then a small lift up to floor 10. Great views of the city and port especially as it was a sunny day. There is a short video half way to the top and then winding stairs to get to the highest part of the tour.  A couple of the steps are steep as well. More great views from the upper 360° terrace. Plenty of time to take photographs before heading back down . The stairs aren't as strenuous as it sounds with over 100 to climb and you do get a rest half way up for the video.",

I really liked the rustic-themed interior design, and the background music was pleasant to listen to.\nThere was a wide variety of menu options, with different brunch and lunch selections. We ordered dishes we had never tried before - sweet items served in a savoury style - and they use halal chicken. We didn't have to wait long for our food. The presentation was appealing, and the dishes were very flavourful.\nI noticed an Asian touch in the bread and butter pudding I had. I really enjoyed it at first, though by the end the portion felt a bit too much for me to finish alone.\nThe main reason I chose this restaurant was because they offer matcha latte on the menu, but unfortunately I didn't find the matcha flavour particularly strong or distinctive.\nThe service was fast and efficient.

Our menus had been printed with Happy 80th Birthday on them and a little birthday treat at the end of the meal, which was a lovely touch. We did the tasting menu and wine pairing. The food was outstanding, and the wines were a perfect match. We have dined in many places doing tasting menus, and The Art School has by far been the best. The staff were all very attentive and friendly. We wouldn't hesitate to return and we would highly recommend this gorgeous restaurant.",

There is no other place in this city that will ever beat the dining experience of the art school. The food is not only delicious but each plate is a work of art lovingly made and delivered by some incredibly talented and friendly staff, it was lovely to see some familiar faces and had the pleasure of meeting some of the new members of the team last night, all who made our visit wonderful once again, thank you for a lovely time, as always ❤️",
