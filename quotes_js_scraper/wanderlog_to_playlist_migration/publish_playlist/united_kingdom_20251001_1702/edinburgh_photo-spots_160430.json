It really gives you that feeling of wonder and wanting to learn and understand more🤓. The height of the building really gives these spaces an advantage, allowing visitors to see the scope of some larger pieces.\n- While there are quieter areas, with simple displays and plaques, there are also plenty of interactive displays as well. This makes it a really engaging place for everyone, including families with younger children.\n- Obviously the free entry is fantastic, especially for a museum with such scope 🤑.\n\nThe Cons ❌\n- While looking through a section of which I have a level of expertise, I found some information to be inaccurate. While I'm certain they wouldn't blatantly lie, it makes me wonder how much of their information is 100% factual 😶.\n- The plaques are interesting yet I found that many were very to the point with surface-level information 🥲. As someone who works in the museum industry I believe it's not just important to explain one piece, but to give the wider context and be transparent about what we do and don't know. This inspires someone to ask questions, think about what they're learning and ask why it matters today 👏👏👏. It encourages a different perspective, so people don't just learn history, but learn from history. I found most of the museum told me things but didn't make me think.\n- It was cool to go up to the rooftop terrace, but the elevator was quite frustrating. It would already get quite full on the bottom couple of floors so those waiting on the four floors in-between them and the roof had to hope that there was enough room for them to squish in. Either way the high volume of people meant the elevator was called to almost each floor... Resulting in a long ride with a lack of personal space 😅😆.\n\nOverall me and my friend still had a nice time here. If anyone wanted a fun day out I'd recommend this place. If anyone had a more specific interest or wanted some more detailed information, I'd recommend somewhere else 😁.",

The open galleries give you room to breathe and never feel crowded. It's easy to move at your own pace, whether you want to stop and study every detail or just take in the sweep of Scotland's story. Theres plenty to keep children engaged, while adults will enjoy the depth and variety. We could have returned for more. The best part is that it manages to be both educational and enjoyable without feeling overwhelming. Truly a world-class museum, and worth every minute.",

From the moment you step inside, you're surrounded by breathtaking beauty and a sense of deep history and reverence.\n\nThe architecture is simply stunning - the vaulted ceiling is a masterpiece in itself, soaring high above with intricate stonework that draws your eyes upward in awe. The stained glass windows are another highlight, casting colourful patterns of light across the interior and telling powerful stories through their design. Each one feels like a work of art, carefully crafted and full of symbolism.\n\nThere's a quiet, almost otherworldly atmosphere inside - peaceful and reflective - which makes the space feel truly sacred. You can feel the centuries of history in every corner, from the ancient stone columns to the memorials and plaques that honour important figures from Scotland's past. Don't miss the Thistle Chapel either - it's an ornate and almost hidden gem within the cathedral, full of detailed woodwork and heraldic carvings.\n\nWhether you're religious or not, this place is so much more than a church - it's a cultural, historical, and architectural landmark. The sense of calm and grandeur is unforgettable.\n\nHighly recommend making time for a visit - it's free to enter (though donations are welcome), and it offers a truly enriching experience. A perfect stop in the heart of the Royal Mile that you won't regret.",

Walking through the different rooms, from the elegant state apartments to the simple crew quarters, you really get to see both sides of life on board. The audio guide and displays are easy to follow, and they make the experience much more engaging.\n\nWhat stood out to me is how well everything has been preserved. It doesn't feel like just a static museum but more like stepping back in time. You can imagine the royal family traveling on board, but also the crew working hard behind the scenes to keep everything running smoothly.\n\nAs someone from Hong Kong, this visit was extra special. Britannia's last official voyage was to my city in 1997, and standing here brought back that piece of shared history. It felt meaningful and a little emotional to see it in person after hearing about it for so many years.\n\nOverall, it's definitely worth a visit.

Whether you shoot from the gardens or climb the monument for panoramic views, every angle offers a romantic and majestic backdrop.\n\nBecause of the elegance and grandeur of the place, it's highly recommended to wear stylish or formal clothes to match the setting. Think classic suits, flowing dresses, or even traditional attire, anything that complements the dramatic and timeless beauty of the monument and its surroundings.",

Not sure if this is a more recent change or if it has always been this way.

It is especially pretty at sunrise and sunset.\nAlthough some may climb or scale the hill to get to the ruins, there is a clear path. Make sure you look at a map of the park as there are clear differences in access and the level of climb difficulty for the various sites within it. The weather is usually windy and wet and the terrain is rocky, uneven and slippery at times. Make sure to wear sensible walking shoes with a tread, if possible, and appropriate wind/rainwear and bring some water if you intend on including Salisbury Crags and Arthur's Seat to your visit. Absolutely worth the visit if you can and you're up to it. The views are phenomenal from all hill tops.\n\nAccess is free and there is car park available at the foot of the park near the Palace.

It's a story that will melt your heart.\n\nGreyfriars Kirkyard is a large graveyard that surrounds the historic Greyfriars Kirk. Kirk is the old Scottish word for a church.\n\nIt's was established as a burial area during the reign of Mary Queen of Scots. Ever since then it has seen over 100,000 people buried here!\n\nThey were called Greyfriars as they wore grey robes – hence where the Kirk and Graveyard get their names!\n\nThe most famous grave here is actually not that of a person but of a little Skye Terrier dog. His name is Greyfriars Bobby! As well as Greyfriars Bobby, fans of the Harry Potter books flock here in droves every year.\n\na lot of people know that The Elephant House Cafe was a regular haunt for J.K.Rowling and is now known as the “birthplace of Harry Potter”.\n\nthis graveyard is only a short walk away from the café! So, it's not too farfetched a theory to think Rowling strolled through here.\n\nAlthough she has never admitted it, it seems as though she was inspired by the names of tombstones in the kirkyard and ended up using them in her stories! So, you'll recognize many famous characters on the tombs like Potter, McGonagall, Moodie, Charles Black, and even Tom Riddle",

            "text": "The National Monument of Scotland, perched on Calton Hill in Edinburgh, is a striking and serene place, especially if you visit early in the morning or on a quiet weekday. Inspired by the Parthenon in Athens, its grand, unfinished columns rise against the open sky, creating a powerful and poetic silhouette.\n\nSurrounded by wide open space and panoramic views of the city, the Firth of Forth, and even Arthur's Seat in the distance, it feels both majestic and peaceful. There aren't usually many people here on weekdays, which makes it perfect for taking your time, enjoying the fresh air, and capturing beautiful photos from all angles. Love it 😻",

            "text": "A visit to Edinburgh isn't complete without a trip to Calton Hill, and the National Monument is the crown jewel of this stunning location. The walk up is invigorating and offers an ever-expanding panoramic view of the city that is simply unmatched.\n\nThe monument itself, often called \"Scotland's Folly,\" is a powerful and beautiful sight. The unfinished Parthenon-inspired columns are a tribute to the Scottish soldiers and sailors of the Napoleonic Wars, and the incomplete nature of the structure adds to its unique charm and historical weight. You can get right up close and walk among the towering columns, feeling the history seep from the stones.\n\nWhat truly makes this a five-star experience, however, is the setting. The monument sits at the heart of a breathtaking 360-degree view. To the west, you have the dramatic Edinburgh Castle and the hustle and bustle of Princes Street. To the east, the vast expanse of the Firth of Forth. To the south, the majestic Arthur's Seat looms large, and to the north, you can see across the city towards the New Town.\nIt's a photographer's paradise, a history lover's dream, and a perfect spot to simply sit and take in the beauty of Edinburgh. The National Monument is a must-see landmark that is both grand and humbling, and a perfect reminder of the city's rich past.",
