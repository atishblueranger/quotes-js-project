The water is refreshing, makes the public happy and relaxed, allows kids to enjoy a city visit and provides poor citizens with a place where they can mingle with everyone else in a relaxed way. It also gives enough water for great flowers and the gardens/park pieces next to the water mirror. And, when quiet, the reflection doubles the grandeur of the bourse buildings.
