The atmosphere is incredible, and it's also right by the lake, which adds to the charm. It's a very scenic spot.\n\nThere's a restaurant nearby in case anyone gets hungry, and overall, the park is huge. Behind it, there's also a forest - as you can probably tell from the photo - where you might feel like you could get lost, but in reality, it's easy to find your way back.\n\nThe landscape is stunning and perfect for anyone who's craving a bit of adventure.\n\nIf I had to point out something negative, it would be because of animals like cows and others roaming around, which means there's quite a lot of droppings scattered around. I think it needs to be cleaned more regularly so the park can reach its full potential.\n\nEven so, if you live nearby, it's a great place to visit every weekend, especially since options are limited. In general, it just needs a bit of cleaning - maybe during the week. But overall, it's a wonderful place to visit",

Staff were always very helpful accommodating.\n\nThe only downside I would add, is that in the auditorium the material on the seats in a bit rough (especially on bare legs or tights), and the seats are too tightly packed in, so there isn't any leg room (less than an aeroplane!). So it feels very cramped in. Not enough to put me off, but I really do hope they can do something about it at some point soon.",

            "text": "A Perfect Sunny Day at Cannon Hill Park, Birmingham\n\nMy wife and I recently spent a sunny afternoon at Cannon Hill Park in Birmingham, and it was truly a wonderful experience. From the moment we arrived, we were struck by the park's stunning natural beauty – wide open green spaces, beautiful flowerbeds, and the gentle sound of birds singing and water trickling through the stream. It's the perfect escape from the noise of the city.\n\nWe took a long, relaxing walk through the park, and every step was a joy. The fresh air, peaceful atmosphere, and scenic views made it feel like a small piece of countryside right in the heart of Birmingham. Along the way, we passed several charming coffee shops and an ice cream van, which added a lovely touch to our visit – ideal for taking a short break and enjoying a treat.\n\nOne of the highlights is the presence of the historic MAC (Midlands Arts Centre), located within the park. It offers exhibitions, performances, and a café with outdoor seating, perfect for enjoying a drink while soaking in the view. There are also picturesque bridges, boating lake areas, and even a small funfair for families.\n\nWhether you're going for a walk, having a picnic, or just sitting on a bench to relax, Cannon Hill Park offers something for everyone. We truly enjoyed every single minute and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Birmingham – it's a hidden gem that captures both the beauty of nature and the charm of the city's history.\n\nYou can see my photos and reviews on my Instagram: @h_albermani",

We sat on a balcony so had an excellent view of the stage.\nGentle ramps everywhere, easy access to toilets so very disabled friendly, the bar has a dedicated counter so people with mobility issues don't have to queue, a very welcome feature.  The Staff are friendly and polite.\nLimited free bookable disabled parking in a secure gated area with level access into the venue. This is adjacent to the canal and short distance from the Black Sabbath bridge.  We would definitely go there again.",

I opted for the Beyond Burger, curly fries, and salad, followed by some delicious brownies. The menu also featured a variety of burger options, while some of my colleagues enjoyed pizzas and wraps. The curly fries and brownies were personal highlights for me😊. Additionally, I tried a non-alcoholic cocktail, Spring Passion, I particularly think that was refreshing and well-prepared.\n\nThe venue itself is beautifully decorated and had a warm and inviting ambiance.\n\nOverall, Flight Club is a fantastic choice for team-building activities or group lunches.

The fascinating history of chocolate, brilliantly presented in films and interactive presentations, then theater, workshops, children's games, and a 4D cinema – there's truly something for everyone, regardless of age. Free chocolate bars are provided along the route, and a tasting of liquid chocolate is a must! Free parking is a big plus, which is rare. The only downside? Prices, especially at the factory café, are quite high by Polish standards. Still, it's worth it! A great place for a family trip or a nostalgic return to childhood.",

However I understand and appreciate that they need to adapt first to this environment before exposing them to public.\nOverall, it was a very fun experience and Happy Weekend instead!!",

These are back at the beginning of exhibition so you can head round again to pick up any bits you missed!\nIt is a great half day out with the kids. The centre feels like it could do with some updating and refresh on some of the side activities but the exhibits are all great, and the feeding / talk times flow quite well through your visit. The staff are all super friendly and helpful, our daughters especially loved the roaming pirate!",

With about 15 acres to explore you could easily spend 3-4hrs here!\n\nPerfect for a nice relaxed afternoon if you go during the week, I imagine it's quite a bit busier on the weekends and school holidays.\n\nBe aware that the hot-houses are very hot and humid! Probably 30-35? so if you go in the colder months make sure you can remove some layers easily.\n\nThe grounds are broadly wheelchair accessible, with sloping ramps. Although if possible take someone who is able to open doors as one door in the cacti room to an accessible ramp does get stuck and some slopes (while gentle for those walking) could be a little steep for a manual chair.\n\nPlenty of benches around, some in the sun and some in the shade as well as a large gazebo-like structure near the rose garden you could duck into if it rains.\n\nPerfect for kiddos, if you park yourself in the cafe with a view to the hothouse door you can safely send them off on their own to run around for hours. There is a plat area as well if that's more their thing than running through bushes.\n\nLove the little shop, lots of gardening bits as well as cards, pottery and artwork all priced fairly high as you would expect for any garden centre/ public attraction.\n\nThe cafe seems well enough, again watch out for your wallet as the cakes on display look delicious!",

From the moment you step in, you're greeted by peaceful pathways, lush greenery, and glasshouses filled with exotic plants from all around the world. Each section felt like its own little ecosystem-whether it was the tropical house with giant palms and koi ponds, or the arid house showcasing cacti and succulents. It's an ideal spot for a quiet walk, a bit of inspiration, or even just to unwind with nature.\n\nThe space is bright and modern with a creative vibe-housed in a former gallery-which adds to the atmosphere.  the pastries at medicine bakery are genuinely next-level.\n\nAll in all, it made for a perfect half-day escape-nature, culture, and seriously good food. Whether you're a local or just visiting Birmingham, this duo should be high on your list.",

They have a great range of animals which have lovely, clean enclosures, they look well looked after, and it's a great atmosphere. We stopped at the little cafe to grab an ice cream, there's a small indoor soft play area but you need to make sure your children have socks if you want to use it. There's a lovely outdoor park with a large climbing frame, a large rope seesaw swing and walkways for children. £11 for an adult during peak times, under 3's are free.\n\nWas a really nice afternoon out and my son loved it!

Of course, it depends on what you're looking for, but we personally didn't enjoy our visit.\n\nThe service felt very intense, almost like the staff were looking down on us. I get that they have a certain etiquette, but true professionalism means adapting to each customer's mood and experience – not making them feel uncomfortable. The food itself wasn't bad, but for a Michelin-rated place, it didn't blow us away.\n\nWe went with a Groupon voucher gifted to us, and were surprised when the bill included a hefty service charge of the full price menu, instead of just charging on top of drinks. I understand that some fine-dining places automatically include service, and normally I'm happy to pay it – if the service matches. But what if it's young students or guests who received it as a gift and weren't expecting to be hit with an extra £40–£50? Definitely something worth considering.\n\nWhat bothered me most was that while filming parts of the experience (which is common in fine dining these days), the waiter told me not to film him as he presented the food. I wasn't filming him directly – just capturing the overall experience. If you're working in a high-end, presentation-focused restaurant, you should expect that some guests will be recording. If that's an issue, maybe a different work environment would suit better.\n\nOverall, the food was decent but not unforgettable, and you can absolutely find better Michelin-level restaurants where the service is warm, respectful, and genuinely customer-focused. Sadly, this one didn't live up to expectations.",

Brilliant flavours, unusual but fantastic mix of foods that just worked. Great presentation also and the staff were amazing - special shout-out to Jash/Jesh and there was a lovely lady attending to us also!\n\nNice interiors, although seemed slightly dated - wondered if this was the point? I love that you can see the window in the kitchen - very ‘The Bear' vibes also saw Purnell in there which is always nice to see!\n\nBrilliant food, they had a good festive menu deal on! Great value for money, lots of courses and additional gifts. Highly recommend this place - it's no surprise it's Michelin star! Just superb flavours!

I started off with a few games on the foo fighters machine, which was great as it pumped out some of their best work while I played, and gave the extra incentive to play better and longer!\n\nAfter that, I chilled out with a few beers, and got my wife a couple of coffees in. We went during a quiet time, and were served by the owner who I quietly recognised from media I'd previously seen. Service was friendly and courteous. A few times he offered to bring our drinks to our table.\n\nMy wife enjoyed the coffee, it looked and smelt great to me. I tried three different pints, but you can buy various smaller measures, which is handy as the beer is definitely not cheap, ranging from £5.60 to £24 for a pint! The three I had were lovely though.\n\nIt's the kind of place that's definitely worth checking out at least once as a great experience, but not somewhere I could see myself regularly visiting. I came in ready with pound coins for the machines, but I believe they sort you out with change at the counter if you're not as well prepared.",

Can imagine this being an extremely popular place to visit during the warmer days.\n\nOne floor dedicated to Shakespeare.\nAll the other floors dedicated to study spaces, quiet areas, access to computers and spaces to bring your laptop.\nThere are plenty of books around on most floors and got lost in the middle of them all.

When you send long spells in a library it's helpful to be able to get a drink. In the British Library there are about four or five cafes on site which enables you to work, take a comfort break and return to researching or studying. Not sure why the second city's main public library doesn't have this important feature. I also think the business section could do with more resources and event to support businesses and business start up. That said, staff are helpful and professional. It's easy to take out or renew memberships. I love the light and airy space on each floor and the statement elevators. The roof top garden is beautiful and a great amenity space on a warm day for us to catch up on phone calls. Again I may have remained there if I could have gotten a drink. Instead we leaf after two hours just to get refreshments.",

Its in a court yard with a few other venues nearby.\n\nIts all black walls inside but not dark as they are covered in artwork etc. using UV and glow in the dark paint, and as there are UV lights everywhere, its brightly lite up.\n\nDrinks selection on draught not the bog standard drinks but nothing special. They do have a large cocktail selection which we didn't try and you can clearly see the options as they are displayed on a huge boad behind the bar with funky names.\n\nThere are several consoles that are free to use, including some classic games from the 80's so you could easily spend hours here if your into gaming.\n\nSpread around the venue are arcade games that take tokens you can buy from the bar. This includes booths for guitar hero and dance revolution.\n\nThey do sell food but we didnt try it.\n\nI do like it here",

Friendly and relaxed staff. Comfy little lobby although it can get a little crowded in winter as people are less likely to sit outside. Wide range of hot and cold drinks - including local beers - and snacks for such a small venue. Often a small, fun selection of cocktails. Always a good time in the big screen, and screen 2 was great and very comfy when a friend hired it for a private screening for a birthday party. They have since updated the screen 2 seating as well (pictured). Recycling facilities are available in the corridors. Screen 2 and the lobby are all level access. I think screen 1 is level access but access to the toilets is down steps unless you go through screen 1 (I may be mistaken - please contact the venue if you need to check).

The experience itself was well done, ample time in the tank, felt safe and well informed throughout.\nThank you for the best day!  🦈",

Absolutely loved it, and didn't stop smiling. I'm not great with heights but pushed that to one side and even paid the extra £10 to go high on second flight.\nWe had a fantastic instructor Dylan, put your trust in them as you are in good hands. It was great watching him when we'd finished, some incredible skills. Pass on my thanks to Dylan 👌🏼\nThe venue too was great even if you aren't taking part, there's some good areas for spectators, places to sit and grab a bite to eat or drink.\nIt was a shame the adventure park was closed as this should have been included in our ticket, so didn't get to do that. But regardless a great day.\nI'll definitely be back.",
