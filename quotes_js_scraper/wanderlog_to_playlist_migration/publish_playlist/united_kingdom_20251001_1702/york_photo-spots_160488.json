Named after the Turkish Sufi and poet Hacı Bayram-ı Veli, it offers a fascinating blend of spiritual and historical value.\n\nThe surrounding area is equally captivating. Behind the mosque, you'll find a park with ancient signs of the past, including monuments from the Roman era, over 2100 years old. The traditional handcraft shops nearby add to the cultural richness of the experience.\n\nIn addition to its beauty and history, Hacı Bayram Mosque offers excellent views of Ankara city.

This monument is significant as it reflects the deep respect and admiration the Turkish people have for Atatürk and his role in shaping modern Turkey.\n\nThe surrounding Ulus Square is also historically important as it was the administrative center of the Turkish Republic in its early years. The statue is often a focal point for national celebrations and ceremonies, particularly on public holidays like Republic Day (October 29) and Victory Day (August 30).",

Standing tall in the Çankaya district, this observation and communications tower is not just a tourist attraction-it's a symbol of the city itself.\n\nThe tower features a panoramic terrace with 360-degree views of Ankara, making it a perfect spot for photography lovers and anyone who wants to see the capital from above. Whether you visit during the day or at night, the view is truly stunning.\n\nInside Atakule, you'll find a variety of restaurants, cafés, and shops. The revolving restaurant is a special highlight-it slowly rotates while you dine, allowing you to enjoy a changing view of the city as you eat. There's also a modern shopping area at the base of the tower, with local and international brands, making it a great place to spend a few hours.\n\nThe area around Atakule is peaceful and well-maintained, perfect for a walk or a coffee break. It's also easy to access by taxi or public transportation.\n\nOverall, Atakule is more than just a tower-it's an experience. Whether you're a local or a visitor, I highly recommend adding it to your Ankara itinerary.🌺🌺🌺♥️♥️♥️🤩",

You can wander through the plants, soak in the natural light, and even buy a few if something catches your eye. The whole place has this calm, airy atmosphere that makes it perfect for studying, reading, or just escaping the noise of the city.\n\nThe coffee? 9/10. The staff? Friendly and professional. And if you're feeling bold (or just bored), there's a piano you're welcome to play.\n\nIt's aesthetically beautiful, full of unique little corners perfect for photos, and easily one of the best places in town to relax or get some work done.

It is a popular place for models and brides to be photographed. There r restaurants at regular intervals so u can refresh yourself.  This is a place to come to for the whole afternoon. I love the water- and windmill, the kid's parks, and a long swinging bridge. (Unfortunately, it was closed due to repair when we were there.) The only issue is the menus. Every restaurant sells literally the same unhealthy food. Most are sweets and processed snacks and gözleme, which is OK, but there's little filling and lots of dough. No side dish, salad or fruit available. The selection of drinks is also incredibly weak. No plant-based mylk or vegean snacks.",
