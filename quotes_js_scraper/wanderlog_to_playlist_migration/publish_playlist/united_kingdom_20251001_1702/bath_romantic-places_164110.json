It is one of the best-preserved Roman sites in the world, and walking around the baths makes you feel like you have stepped back in time. The building is beautiful, and the old Roman architecture is impressive to see.\n\nWhen you visit, you get an audio guide that explains everything clearly and helps you understand the history behind the baths. There are also some interactive displays and videos that make the visit more fun and easy to follow, even for children. The staff are friendly and ready to help if you have any questions.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that the baths can get very busy, especially during weekends and holidays. This sometimes makes it hard to enjoy the place quietly or take your time looking at the exhibits. Also, the ticket price is a bit expensive for some people, but the experience is worth it if you like history. The toilets and other facilities could be easier to find inside the site.\n\nOverall, The Roman Baths are a great place to learn about Roman life and enjoy a unique part of Bath's history. I recommend visiting early in the morning or later in the afternoon to avoid the biggest crowds. It's a fun and educational visit for families, tourists, and anyone curious about the past.",

The Royal Crescent spans over 500 feet (150 meters) and is beautifully set against the backdrop of rolling hills, making it a must-see for tourists and photographers. What really distinguishes the Royal Crescent is its perfect balance of symmetry and elegance. The curved design was revolutionary for its time and continues to impress today, featuring classical elements like columns that set it apart from the more conventional straight rows of houses. It's also the perfect location to relax on the hill fields, enjoying a great view and the joy of pleasant weather.",

We visited on a very sunny day which brought the experience to a whole next level. The sharing platter, soups, and drinks at the café after the 2-hour spa session was also nice.",

We had no wait, robes and towels supplied, lockers, and showers available. The pools were all enjoyable and the rooftop pool had exquisite views! Our visit was in April during a sunny day/twilight. So glad we didn't miss an opportunity to enjoy a spa day.  We went into the dry and steam saunas, relaxation room, and ice bath. This was our very first stop during our stay in Bath and it really set the tone. Everyone was friendly and helpful at the spa. We ended our evening at the cafe with the sharing platter, soup and drinks. Could not think of a better way to spend our first evening in Bath.\nNo phones allowed! This helped us to immerse ourselves in the experience ♥️",

I had the Brie and cranberry bun and added bacon, which was our favorite dish. The lemon curd bun was mediocre, and the open club was nothing we could not have made at home. But it seemed like the people around us enjoyed their food and it's a fun place to spend lunch in bath because it is an experience beyond just the food. We did like the food, but just didn't feel it was extraordinary. People must think it's extraordinary for the business to stay running for so many years!",

Scones were pretty standard. And the raspberry shortbread dessert bite was super good!\n\nJane Austen tea was really good!

It would've been even better with a slice of bread to round it out. We were really hoping to try the Marsala French toast (which came recommended in other reviews), but it was no longer available - a bit of a letdown. We went with the regular French toast with maple syrup and bacon instead. It was very sweet and felt like it needed something to cut through the sugar. The portion size was solid.\n\nThe sides, however, were excellent - the mushrooms and homemade beans were both a great choice. Drinks-wise, the orange juice was tasty but only came in a half-full glass, which felt a bit stingy.\n\nThe menu itself could use some improvement. It's a bit confusing - pastries, sides, and full breakfast dishes are all mixed together, making it tricky to figure out what to order. Still, the food earns a solid 4 stars from us.\n\nThe real downside was the service. The seating process didn't make much sense. There was a group of five ahead of us who took ages to be seated. Meanwhile, several tables for two were free - both inside and outside - but we were left waiting without any update. When we finally asked, we were told we had to wait for the larger group to be seated first, even though it didn't affect our table. It just felt poorly managed (we waited for almost 0,5h!) - especially when you're hungry and just want a coffee and a bite to eat.",

I cannot recommend the raspberry, white chocolate and mango cheesecake, with passionate fruit syrup within the middle. The watermelon and strawberry prosecco was also divine, we had to have two.

We quickly went inside & made our booking for the evening.\n\nUpon arrival for the showing my lady bought Malteasers and we headed upstairs. We were the sole occupants on the upper balcony and it's myriad sofas. Admittedly this places you very far from the screen at a canted angle so this it to held front of mind when booking.\n\nWe had a great time & enjoyed our evening at Little Theatre. Looking around the posters in the foyer & staircase there seems to be a run of interesting old reruns to be had in the future.

The route is about 6 miles and took us about 3 5 hours although we weren't speedy. Keep an eye out for the yellow direction arrows and you will be fine, although there are a couple of areas where there are no markers for a bit.\nSpectacular views and we kind of wished we had taken a picnic but sadly we didn't.\nThe route can be steep up and down hill in places and there are a few sets of steps. Also the path especially through wooded areas can be uneven and rough under foot and there are a couple of obstacles to navigate, but then this is a country walk. The paths around Claverton down are very flat and easy under foot. Was nice seeing they were restoring dry stone walls.\nDefinitely wear sensible shoes and take water 👌It's a good route and has stunning views, if you take small children expect to end up carrying them. Probably not suitable for people unsteady on their feet.\nDefinitely worth the experience and we walked back to the city centre along the canal.",

The views over the city are stunning, and the famous Palladian Bridge is especially lovely, reflected in the lakes below. The gardens are great for a gentle walk, with wooded paths, quiet spots to sit, and plenty of nature. It's a great spot for families and dog walkers too. There's a small cafe for drinks and snacks, and the staff are friendly and helpful. You can either use public transportation (No. 2 bus) or your on car. There is limited parking space available. You can walk up to the park as it is a short walk from the city centre. Well worth a visit if you're in Bath and looking for some calm and beauty.",

It can be quite steep going and the high view points need good footwear as terrain is uneven. If you have walking difficulties, a wheelchair etc you may find this difficult. Having said that, there are some reasonable paths but you will miss out on some of the high points.\nParking is non existent so you need to either find a side street (not easy), catch a bus or walk there. Cafe wasn't open when we went but there is a really nice garden centre just down the main road. Palladium in the lake is fantastic and worth walking down to. Expect to spend at least 1 to 1.5 hours strolling around.",

We enjoyed our lunch from the cafe, and I popped round to the children's playground to see the wagon. It's definitely worth popping round to see. If we'd had our grandchildren with us, they would have loved the playground and for parents or grandparents supervising there a few playground with such a view. If we lived more locally, we would definitely get an annual ticket,  but it's a bit far from deepest East Sussex.",
