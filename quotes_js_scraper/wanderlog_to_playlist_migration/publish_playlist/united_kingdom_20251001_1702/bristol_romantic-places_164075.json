We arrived 30 minutes early, and the lobby had a great selection of board games to keep us entertained while we waited. This experience was definitely one to check off my bucket list, and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a fun and challenging activity. The staff were exceptional, even accommodating an extra person in our booking at the last minute. Their top-notch customer service is no doubt why the ratings for this place are so high.

The moment I stepped inside, I was captivated by the grandeur and serene atmosphere of the cathedral.\n\nBristol Cathedral's stunning Gothic architecture left me in awe. The intricate details of the stained glass windows, the towering arches, and the beautifully crafted stonework perfectly showcased the cathedral's rich history and spiritual significance. Walking through its vast nave and observing the play of light filtering through the colorful windows was truly mesmerizing.\n\nAlthough I could spend hours describing its beauty, what struck me the most was the peaceful ambiance, which provided a perfect space for reflection and admiration of the artistry that has stood the test of time.\n\nI highly recommend a visit to Bristol Cathedral to anyone who appreciates history, architecture, and serene environments. It's definitely a must-see landmark when in Bristol.",

Also a good place for something private on an off day.\nPick a sunny day as rain and clouds obscure the view. I know…we are speaking of England ;-)\nHope you enjoy it!",

There's not as big a selection of animals, but there are still plenty there to see. We got lucky and managed to see all the animals. There's still work in progress, and there's some work under construction. The highlight for me was seeing the giraffes. One of the giraffes was really close. It was amazing to see. The bear woods was good too, as we managed to see the bears come out at the perfect time. We got ice cream at the end, which was delicious. I had a really nice day here at the zoo.

These were hosted by staff and really clever and fun for the kids. The theme ran across the whole park and there were some really clever bits the kids got to be involved with. There are still some areas of the park under construction but there is still plenty to see and explore. You can definitely see the vision and it will be a great zoo over the next few years.\nThere were some lovely play parks and  climbing bits for the kids. Not many animals but this will increase. The animals they did have were in some great enclosures with easy visibility and unique viewing points. The bear walk was lovely and memorable! Paths were lined with blackberry bushes which felt really natural and aided in the wildlife support. Lots of fun signs and interesting bits for the kids to see along the way. My kids loved the maze too. We had a lovely day out and will return again see what changes and animals are there.

The area in front of the observatory is probably the best for views of the bridge, particularly from the hill itself. There's a statue of Wallace from Wallace and Gromit just outside that bears a resemblance to Brunel which is cool, as a part of a trail on at the moment.\n\nThe observatory tower was a little bit disappointing as it isn't open air - there are windows, a few of which open although I'm not sure if they're supposed to, with a cool but incredibly warm camera obscura at the top. Not the best views of the bridge to be honest, I preferred from underneath the observatory, in the caves.\n\nThe caves were really good - a bit narrow and hard to pass people coming the opposite way, and I did hit my head a couple of times which was a pain. Some parts have uneven surfaces, but it's understandable as it's literally a cave. The views are great, with netting and a fence blocking them a bit but big enough to fit a camera through. The viewing area has a metal but see-through floor which I can understand a lot of people not liking very much, although there's plenty of hard floor behind it if you don't.\n\nOverall, good but not the best. It's only a fiver though for both areas so pretty worth it for the price. There's also a restaurant with open air views but I don't venture up there.",

Mark and Richard aren't just magicians – they're part-time comedians, full-time mind-blowers. Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out how Mark made my jaw disappear for half the night (spoiler: it was from laughing too much).\n\nMark was the perfect entertainer- warm, welcoming, and hilariously cheeky, making just the right amount of fun of everyone (don't worry, it's all in good spirits… unless he actually is a wizard, in which case, RIP my dignity).\n\nThe show was super interactive, so no chance of dozing off – unless you were hypnotized, which I'm still not ruling out. The magic itself? Brilliant. Real “how-did-they-do-that?!” moments that left us all questioning reality and Googling “how to become a magician” on the way home.\n\nIf you want a quirky, laugh-out-loud night out in Bristol that's totally different from the usual pub crawl, go see these guys. Just don't ask them to pull a rabbit out of a hat – they're too busy pulling smiles out of thin air! 🪄✨",

We got a really friendly and welcoming greeting, the decor is just amazing, and combined with the music and drinks selection, it has a great speakeasy vibe that's like stepping back in time. When we visited during a quiet afternoon we thoroughly enjoyed our cocktails and chatting to the bartender. However, when we returned on a busy Friday night, it was a bit of a different experience. The two guys working werr clearly doing their best but really need another member of staff to serve customers. After finishing our drinks we were left waiting 45 minutes before we could order another one - and customers who had arrived looked to be waiting a similar amount of time to receive their drinks. This is just far too long and led to understandable frustration. It's a shame, as the staff are lovely and the cocktails are sublime - some really imaginative and special combinations that we thoroughly enjoyed! It's just let down a bit by the exceedingly slow service when busy. I think we'd go back, but perhaps not on a weekend night.",

The cocktail I had was a lovely complex flavours and nice to feel some love of the drink made.  It's a classy dark and relaxed style bar. (amazing pecan nuts). .",
