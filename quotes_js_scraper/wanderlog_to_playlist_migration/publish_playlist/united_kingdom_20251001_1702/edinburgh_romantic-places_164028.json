It really gives you that feeling of wonder and wanting to learn and understand more🤓. The height of the building really gives these spaces an advantage, allowing visitors to see the scope of some larger pieces.\n- While there are quieter areas, with simple displays and plaques, there are also plenty of interactive displays as well. This makes it a really engaging place for everyone, including families with younger children.\n- Obviously the free entry is fantastic, especially for a museum with such scope 🤑.\n\nThe Cons ❌\n- While looking through a section of which I have a level of expertise, I found some information to be inaccurate. While I'm certain they wouldn't blatantly lie, it makes me wonder how much of their information is 100% factual 😶.\n- The plaques are interesting yet I found that many were very to the point with surface-level information 🥲. As someone who works in the museum industry I believe it's not just important to explain one piece, but to give the wider context and be transparent about what we do and don't know. This inspires someone to ask questions, think about what they're learning and ask why it matters today 👏👏👏. It encourages a different perspective, so people don't just learn history, but learn from history. I found most of the museum told me things but didn't make me think.\n- It was cool to go up to the rooftop terrace, but the elevator was quite frustrating. It would already get quite full on the bottom couple of floors so those waiting on the four floors in-between them and the roof had to hope that there was enough room for them to squish in. Either way the high volume of people meant the elevator was called to almost each floor... Resulting in a long ride with a lack of personal space 😅😆.\n\nOverall me and my friend still had a nice time here. If anyone wanted a fun day out I'd recommend this place. If anyone had a more specific interest or wanted some more detailed information, I'd recommend somewhere else 😁.",

The open galleries give you room to breathe and never feel crowded. It's easy to move at your own pace, whether you want to stop and study every detail or just take in the sweep of Scotland's story. Theres plenty to keep children engaged, while adults will enjoy the depth and variety. We could have returned for more.

From the moment you step inside, you're surrounded by breathtaking beauty and a sense of deep history and reverence.\n\nThe architecture is simply stunning - the vaulted ceiling is a masterpiece in itself, soaring high above with intricate stonework that draws your eyes upward in awe. The stained glass windows are another highlight, casting colourful patterns of light across the interior and telling powerful stories through their design. Each one feels like a work of art, carefully crafted and full of symbolism.\n\nThere's a quiet, almost otherworldly atmosphere inside - peaceful and reflective - which makes the space feel truly sacred. You can feel the centuries of history in every corner, from the ancient stone columns to the memorials and plaques that honour important figures from Scotland's past. Don't miss the Thistle Chapel either - it's an ornate and almost hidden gem within the cathedral, full of detailed woodwork and heraldic carvings.\n\nWhether you're religious or not, this place is so much more than a church - it's a cultural, historical, and architectural landmark. The sense of calm and grandeur is unforgettable.\n\nHighly recommend making time for a visit - it's free to enter (though donations are welcome), and it offers a truly enriching experience. A perfect stop in the heart of the Royal Mile that you won't regret.",

Walking through the different rooms, from the elegant state apartments to the simple crew quarters, you really get to see both sides of life on board. The audio guide and displays are easy to follow, and they make the experience much more engaging.\n\nWhat stood out to me is how well everything has been preserved. It doesn't feel like just a static museum but more like stepping back in time. You can imagine the royal family traveling on board, but also the crew working hard behind the scenes to keep everything running smoothly.\n\nAs someone from Hong Kong, this visit was extra special. Britannia's last official voyage was to my city in 1997, and standing here brought back that piece of shared history. It felt meaningful and a little emotional to see it in person after hearing about it for so many years.\n\nOverall, it's definitely worth a visit. Even if you're not a big history fan, the experience is unique and very memorable.",

Towering over Princes Street Gardens, this Gothic masterpiece was built to honor Sir Walter Scott, and its dark, dramatic spires give it a fairytale-like presence that makes it absolutely stunning in photographs.\n\nIt's a perfect location for pre-wedding photos, especially with the contrast between the ornate black stone, the lush greenery of the gardens below, and the historic charm of Edinburgh in the background. Whether you shoot from the gardens or climb the monument for panoramic views, every angle offers a romantic and majestic backdrop.\n\nBecause of the elegance and grandeur of the place, it's highly recommended to wear stylish or formal clothes to match the setting. Think classic suits, flowing dresses, or even traditional attire, anything that complements the dramatic and timeless beauty of the monument and its surroundings.",

Its striking Gothic architecture and intricate detailing make it a must-see for visitors.\n\nYou can climb the narrow spiral staircase (over 280 steps!) for a small fee, and be rewarded with stunning panoramic views of the city and surrounding landscapes. Along the way, small viewing platforms and historical displays add to the experience. It's a bit of a workout, but well worth it.\n\nA perfect spot for history buffs, architecture lovers, and anyone wanting a unique view of Edinburgh.",

I spent a good couple of hours exploring the halls, chambers, vaults, and spiral staircases of the castle, despite it not being a huge one. But it's quite well preserved in its ruined state, and in fact that's the charm of it; it is fairly intact.\n\nThere was an older gentleman playing the bagpipes in the main hall and a highly knowledgeable enthusiast in full knight's gear preparing for some upcoming medieval re-enactment in the cellar below.\n\nSome parts are closed to visitors due to safety issues, but there's still plenty of accessible areas for one to wander and absorb the history.",

From the outside, it looks like a quirky old-fashioned barbershop, but once you step through the hidden entrance and make your way downstairs, you enter a whole different world.\n\nThe atmosphere is warm, cozy, and full of character. It has this vintage speakeasy vibe, but with a playful twist-like you're in on a really cool secret. The staff were super friendly and knowledgeable, and they clearly have a passion for what they do. They were happy to guide me through the menu and even suggested drinks based on my preferences.",

You have to come and find out it's more than just a drink, it's an art. (And the best is that, they also have a whisky and wine menu)\n\nAnd the atmosphere is amazing for many occasions: dates, friends gathering, solo nights...\n\nWe are very lucky to be seated after a short wait, but please remember to reserve in advance (especially for Fridays and weekends) to avoid disappointments!!",

So much knowledge and such good tasting recommendations.\n\nAnd if you're short for time the bar overlooking Carlton hill is a must visit!\n\n5 stars, thanks Andre",

Beautiful location, great gift shop with some bottles you can only get at the distillery- I couldn't resist the Edinburgh fringe festival exclusives!\n\nOur tour guide Lucy was kind and knowledgeable! She made everyone feel at ease and her passion for gin was contagious. It really made the tour special. The gin itself was delicious! I was blown away at the wide range of flavor profiles.\n\nTo give some feedback on the tasting: I preferred the citrus pairings as the sage was a bit strong for me. I know g&t is king, but it also would have been nice to have club soda as a mixer option alongside the tonic water. However I LOVED having the botanicals there to interact with and smell, it really heightened the sensory experience!\n\nOverall, this experience and product was a great value for the price. Thank you to the helpful staff, from the cashier desk to the gift shop to the tour. Definitely buy a bottle to take with you home as a souvenir (I'm going to open the lime and ginger one this summer!)",

The discount was a bonus too!\n\nHighly recommended experience! Thank you EG!",

We arrived at around 9.30 and got in no problem and found a space at the bar. Later on we were lucky and got some seats / table when other people left. The drinks are delicious (try the ginger beer with sloe gin), service OK and the music was good.",
