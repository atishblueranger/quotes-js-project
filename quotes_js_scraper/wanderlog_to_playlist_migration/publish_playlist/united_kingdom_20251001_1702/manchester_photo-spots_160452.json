Its collections span Asia, Europe, the Middle East, the Americas, and more, all presented through well-curated and engaging displays that avoid feeling monotonous. The museum's recognition as European Museum of the Year 2025 reflects its quality and appeal. While the craftsmanship of some fake animal models might leave a little to be desired, the overall experience remains impressive. The museum also hosts special exhibitions from time to time, such as the eye-catching giant sleeping cat that delights children. It is a popular spot for school field trips, so you might occasionally encounter a lively and noisy atmosphere, but that simply adds to its vibrant and educational character.",

It was wonderfully clean, spacious, and thoughtfully designed. Honestly one of the best multi-faith spaces I've ever seen and used. Absolutely 10/10 for the effort the museum has put into providing such a welcoming and inclusive space for all visitors.",

We shot the ceremony in an events space with jade green walls and antique beams, then drinks reception down the curved stairs and inside the gallery amongst the beautiful art, followed by dinner in the glass extension with trees all around. The couple were allowed to use the gallery for some of their portraits, which created some epic photos. The staff & security were all helpful and friendly, and the food served was impeccable.

So left him awaiting what we both thought to be a short wait on external seating. But after having to queue for entry, was intrigued and decided not to waste my opportunity to peruse it internally too.😂 I was perusing for the best part of an hour 🤣\nTruly a wondrous experience on one's senses of intricate stonework, stained glass windows, statues, intricate wrought iron lamp lights, wonderful cathedral ceilings and arched portals. If only every library was this magical on the eye😂 A veritable temple to knowledge and learning.\nSadly the musty odour of old leatherbound tomes was distinctly absent. Possibly because they were all secreted away behind glass panels. The mahoosive wooden lecturns were positively tomb like.\nToilets were clean and spacious in the bowels of the modern building.\nStaff are friendly and informative",
