Everything about the place makes you feel good to be alive. So awesome inspiring to be here, especially when the organ is playing or when the choir is singing. Spent four hours here and have seen everything but could spend a few more looking at details and such. Reading all the information bulletins takes a while. Staff are so nice and friendly too. Everyone in a good mood throughout the church.",

The building is under repairs, I'm not quite sure what they are doing.  It looked like the work involved the repair of all the carvings on the building (restoration and improvement). Many of the stone carvings were quite degraded. Even so, the building was remarkable to see. Sadly, we didn't have enough time to experience it entirely. We didn't get to go inside nor enjoy the gardens. I would definitely recommend it, so peaceful even with all the construction works going on.\n\nThere is no parking on the site, we found it best to park at margate car park next to the museum gardens. Lots of parking spaces, and u will enjoy walking through the city on your way to the Minster. It's very expensive, though 😕 as is everywhere else in York.",

The Jorvik Viking Centre isn't your average museum-you're taken on a ride through a recreated Viking village, complete with lifelike figures, sounds, and even smells (yes, including a latrine). It's surprisingly immersive and gives you a real sense of what life might have been like in 10th-century York.\n\nThe highlight is definitely the ride, but the exhibition afterwards is packed with genuine artefacts found right on that site. It's all well presented and easy to engage with, even if you're not a history buff. Staff are friendly, knowledgeable, and dressed in costume, which adds to the atmosphere.\n\nIt's not a long visit-around an hour-but it's packed with detail and charm. Great for families, and still interesting enough for adults going solo. Not cheap, but worth it for the experience. Book ahead to avoid disappointment.",

            "text": "I've often enjoyed  a stroll or a picnic in these beautiful gardens on my frequent visits to York. They were especially beautiful on my latest spring visit, when they were filled with colourful tulips and tree blossom. Located just outside the city walls, close to Bootham Bar and the Minster, they have lots of grassy space for children to run and play in, well tended flowerbeds, a lovely rock garden, and a riverside walk with a convenient exit to the riverbank and cruises. They're also rich in history, with some evocative Roman and medieval ruins. In the Middle Ages, these gardens were the grounds of St Mary's Abbey, which rivalled the Minster in size and grandeur until it was dissolved in the 16th century. Its ruins are still impressive, and I've seen them used as a backdrop for wedding photos. There's also an observatory containing a refractor telescope, but I've never actually seen it open for visits. It's well worth spending a couple of hours in the museum. There are lots of benches and a picnic area, but no toilets; the nearest ones are a 5 minute walk away at Bootham Bar. No café either, but there are vendors selling ice-cream, coffee and snacks near the entrance. I could happily spend the whole day here. A lovely place to escape the bustle of the city centre!",

Picture this: centuries-old ruins, colourful flower beds, and enough benches to rest your legs (or just to sit and people-watch while eating a suspiciously large ice cream).\n\nYou've got tours, a museum, and-most importantly-ample open space to unleash your inner gymnast. Yes, it's entirely possible to do a cartwheel in front of historically significant ruins here, which I'm sure is what the architects intended.\n\nPerfect for a peaceful wind-down after battling the bustling city centre. Well worth a visit… just mind the ducks, they walk like they own the place.",

Plus the confectionery shop was shut and that also was to pay and only cash so it costs extra for other things, the world war exhibition I feel was quite smaller and there could have been better things to do there also.

Made better by the sunshine and clear, blue skies. There were plenty of things to see along the way, and moments where we were able to stop off, take in our surroundings and simply be still, in the moment. At certain points, there are benches to rest and take in the sights and sounds of York. It was fascinating to try and picture, while walking these walls, what life would have been like back then. I found myself wondering throughout the walk \"Who once walked these walls?\" \"Who were they as a person?\" \"What were they thinking about?\" Of course, along the way, you come across the 'bars' which are great to see (came across one, which I didn't know was a cafe!) Although we didn't go inside, it certainly looked quirky! A great place to stop off, for a drink and maybe a slice of cake, before continuing on the adventure! Definitely a great day out, especially for those into history like myself, as there are information boards along the way, telling you about the history of York. And best of all? It's free! So if you fancy taking in the sights of this ancient city, want to learn more about it, and walk in the footsteps of those before us, then I'd recommend walking the York City Walls.",

If you want to visit all four sections of the city wall, you will have to enter and exit the city wall four times at different entrances. During the tour of the city wall, you can appreciate the scenery of York from different angles, including its most famous landmark, York Cathedral. In addition, you will see many people living in the residential areas next to the city. It feels very special to spend the afternoon leisurely like this. If you have time, I suggest you spend some time visiting these four sections of the city wall. You will definitely not regret it.",

We sat row F, seats 1-3.  The whole performance was gifted from start to end, with usual cheesey jokes, quips and great catchy songs.  This performance had that little bit more, the whole cast just have something special and kept you captivated.  From choosing a member of the audience to play bit parts in the panto, to children shouting boos and laughing totally out loud....the panto was a Christmas cracker and we would go back to see this cast again.

Since I live abroad I thought I might have difficulties to purchase tickets and pre-order merch but everyone at box office were incredibly helpful and made the process very very easy.

The hummus was amazing, the meats were nice but the cheese by far was better … just delicious. A casual vibe with stunning art work for sale on the walls. Highly recommended",

We arrived at 9:15 AM and it was almost empty.  We got in line for the Ghost Merchants.  Arriving early allows you to enjoy the street before it gets super busy.  The eateries were great and the employees at every shop we went to were so kind and welcoming.   Our entire experience was excellent.  We came back in the evening during a witch tour and it was also quiet.  All the shops had shut down and besides the unfortunate scaffolding currently in place, it was also charming and inviting.  We did our best to enjoy all the shops (so many great ones!) and avoided any place that would provide royalties to she who shall not be named.  Really loved our time here.",

This is a must see tourist spot for an insight into Yorks past. It offers a gorgeous view from the top of a very steep hill with lots of stairs to the top, however no lift or disabled access, one can only imagine how fun it would be to sled down it in the winter- from the top you can see over the museum and surrounding areas, I believe it to be very beautiful for a sunset…",

It was lovely to have a look around cliffords tower and there are things to look at like it's history and the view from the top but not much more. It definitely won't take long and it's quite a pull walking up the very steep steps (55 I think) so you do need to be fit. Give it a look round you may learn something.",

The most worthwhile thing about the whole attraction is to go to the top floor of the tower to see the scenery of York town in 360 degrees. In different directions, they will provide signs to remind you of other landmarks you can see. On sunny days, you can come here and sit on the bench to enjoy the sun and appreciate the beautiful scenery of York.",

The Merchant Adventurers' Hall is a proper bit of history-think it dates back to the 1300s, which is mad when you're walking around inside it.\n\nThe upstairs hall was especially cool, with this super wonky floor that you definitely notice while walking-feels like you're slightly on a ship! You can just imagine how many people have walked those same boards over the centuries.\n\nOnly small downside was the massive old kitchen fireplace upstairs has been mostly covered over with silverware displays, which is a bit of a shame-it would've been great to see it in all its glory. Still, the building itself and the history behind it are more than worth the visit!",

            "text": "I'd enjoyed good food and hospitality at this pub on previous day trips to York, and this visit was certainly no different! Conveniently located just inside the city walls, between Bootham Bar and the Minster, it's an atmospheric old place with wooden beams, exposed brick walls, cosy lounges, and an intriguing mystery surrounding the discovery, in 1816, of a dungeon and a passage that was hurriedly bricked up after ghostly footsteps were heard there. It's claimed you can occasionally still hear them! Because of the pub's location on a busy and narrow street, there is no outside seating. I found a nice table in the larger lounge at the back, with its quirky modern decor and a choice of seating options. The bar staff were welcoming and friendly, and although the pub filled up very quickly, service was surprisingly quick. Great choice of cask ales, and an extensive gin list on the table, but I opted for a good Merlot. The large menu included grills, burgers, jacket potatoes, a house salad, and traditional main courses. I chose the special: a giant Yorkshire pudding filled with mashed potato, carrots, broccoli, and three slices of roast beef (you can have sausages as an alternative), with a pot of horseradish sauce and rich gravy. The meal was piping hot, well cooked, and very filling. Didn't have room for any of the tempting desserts on offer! Prices were very reasonable. The ambience was lively and friendly. Overall, an ideal place to stop for lunch when sightseeing in York.",

Our drinks were brought to us at our table 11. The young lady was very pleasant. The same young lady brought our food too.\nI was extremely surprised at the cost of 3 meals with 3 drinks, £69.75. I expected it to be more expensive. It was quite warm in the pub so aircon would have been very useful. However, a nice meal was had by all, and I would definitely visit again if in York.",

He said the sauce was amazing and the chicken was cooked perfectly.\nI can't complement it enough!\n\nThe desserts were amazing as well! We had the sticky toffee pudding and the chocolate brownie. The only thing I questioned was the sticky toffee pudding wasn't heated up but the brownie was which I thought should be the other way or both warm instead.

            "text": "It's a nice place, not extortionately expensive and the food is good though not great. This place obviously gets good reviews and I suppose that left us little disappointed in the food. The starters were both ok, 6/10. The steak was also ok. We went to flat iron in London recently and their steak was both nicer and cheaper, so I'm really judging against that. I opted for the mash, which was nice but not very smooth. Having tried the chips they were definitely the better option. The red wine sauce was great but it was the dessert that was the star, the apples in the apple crumble were just the right softness and I have to say its one of the nicest apple crumbles I've ever had. The drinks menu was a little limited on the cocktail front and the margarita was very heavily salted, almost like drinking the sea at times. All in all a nice restaurant, but one that left us slightly underwhelmed. It is quite small, so I would book in advance.",

It was our first time in York and we didn't know York is called “the city of cats” but we were thrilled to walk past this place! We were able to secure a walk in spot with only an hours notice which gave us a little time to explore the area. They have over 20 cats here, all of which are extremely adorable. The smoothies, tea, cake, and scones were delicious too! The cake portions are huge so be prepared, but every bite was fantastic. We especially loved Pumpkin, the fluffy orange cat who was very eager to try and snag a bite of our snacks 😂\nLove this place and the work they do for the local cats. 💗",

All of the cats were very content and sleeping. The carrot cake was amazing 🤤 The staff were welcoming and happy to tell us about the cats. The highlight was Pumkin coming to sit on our knees!! Would definitely go back and highly recommend 👌",

Super exciting as we've never been to a cat cafe before and we are glad we made this one our first one. The staff were lovely, we both had a latte and it was really good.
