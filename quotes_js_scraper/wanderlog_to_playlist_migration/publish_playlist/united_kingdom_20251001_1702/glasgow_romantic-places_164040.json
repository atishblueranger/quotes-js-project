The staff on the ticket desk where very polite and helpful. Inside there was lots to do and see. It was filled with interesting and interactive exhibits. We only stayed for a few hours as we had to catch a flight home but you could easily make it a whole day. My daughter had lots of fun learning new things as we went around. There was also an inclosed play area for children which was lovely my 4 year old didn't want to leave. There was also a cafe unfortunately we didn't have the time to try it. My 5 year old has said she wants to go to Scotland for her birthday treat so if we return we would definitely be visiting again as I know my 5 year old would love this just as much if not more.",

Each dish a revelation, each dish conversational. I had a Tavel  rosé throughout which was as memorable as my food. Desserts were apple tarte tatin/blue cheese/prune jus and Affogato with a wonderful coffee/ gelato/remy martin combination that perfectly finished my culinary journey.\nI love this restaurant and it is a privilege to share in the dishes and the dream of someone who has created something very special. 👏 Shout out to Jim who did his best to describe a menu which is indescribably wonderful.

The main building is a stunning example of Gothic Revival style, and it genuinely feels like stepping into another era. From the pointed arches and intricate stone carvings to the massive spires that reach into the sky, it's a place that grabs your attention from every angle.\n\nDesigned by Sir George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century, the building looks more like a cathedral or a fantasy castle than a university. The level of detail is insane - every window, column, and corridor has a story. The cloisters (those arched walkways under the building) are especially beautiful, and they make the whole place feel peaceful and dramatic at the same time.\n\nWhat's really cool is how the building blends history with everyday life. Students walk through these centuries-old halls daily, and yet it still feels fresh and full of life. It's one of those rare places where the architecture isn't just for show - it's still being used and appreciated the way it was meant to be.\n\nEven if you're not an architecture nerd, it's impossible not to be impressed. Take a walk through, look up, and just enjoy being surrounded by some of the most beautiful stonework in the city.",

One of our guests was travelling with their dog, and according to the website, dogs are welcome on the ground floor. Since there's a quiet and comfortable area downstairs that seemed suitable for a business meal, we made our booking with a clear note stating that we'd be bringing a dog and that it was a business occasion.\n\nUnfortunately, when we arrived, we were told that our table had been booked upstairs-where dogs aren't allowed. When we pointed this out, the staff checked and confirmed that our note had indeed been included in the reservation, but it had simply been overlooked. Mistakes happen, and we understand that. However, by the time we arrived, there were no free tables left in the quieter area on the ground floor. Instead of making an exception and allowing the dog upstairs in light of their own mistake, we were asked to wait and were eventually seated in the very loud pub area. It was far from suitable for a professional conversation.\n\nSorry Stravaigin, but we communicated everything clearly in advance-both the business context and the presence of a dog. If that information is ignored, the customer shouldn't have to bear the consequences. A customer-focused solution would have been the right thing to do. Based on this experience, I can't recommend Stravaigin for business dining or for situations that require flexibility or accountability.",

The vintage, shabby-chic decor with mismatched china and cozy atmosphere makes you feel like you've stepped into a beautiful, quirky time machine. The afternoon tea service itself is outstanding. The sandwiches were fresh and flavorful, the scones were warm and delicious, and the selection of homemade cakes and treats was fantastic. They offer a huge variety of teas, and the staff are wonderful-attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. It's an incredible value for the quality and experience you receive.

This Victorian masterpiece is an absolute must-see and a true five-star experience.\n\nPerched on a hill overlooking Glasgow Cathedral, the Necropolis offers breathtaking panoramic views of the city. As you ascend the winding paths, each turn reveals a new and stunning monument. The sheer scale and intricate detail of the tombs and mausoleums are awe-inspiring, a testament to the city's rich history and the craftsmanship of the time. You can spend hours wandering, reading the fascinating inscriptions, and admiring the varied architectural styles, from Greek Revival to Gothic.\n\nThe atmosphere is one of serene beauty and historical reverence, not at all eerie. It's a peaceful place for a walk, a spot for contemplation, and a photographer's dream, especially as the light changes throughout the day. The \"Bridge of Sighs\" that connects the cathedral to the Necropolis is an iconic entry point, setting the stage for the grandeur that awaits.\n\nWhether you're a history buff, an architecture enthusiast, or simply looking for a unique and beautiful place to explore in Glasgow, the Necropolis delivers on every front. It's a truly unforgettable place that captures the city's past and offers some of the best views you'll find anywhere.",

The entertainment with the Irish songs was top notch, beers are great as well - I love how their Scottish lager is brewed locally to German purity laws, so you know it'll be good! So were the Scottish IPAs and Guinness\n\nI came up here for the monthly macaroni themed buffet event. April's theme was Greek. I won't pretend the food was the most mind blowing stuff I've ever tried, I believe they're better at being a pub than a restaurant but the food was good and the atmosphere just topped it off. The staff did a great job. It was good enough I took some of the “mystery mac” (which was Greek style mousaka) in a takeaway box. I would 100% come back here on a monthly pilgrimage, and I come all the way from Oxfordshire for the privilege! Yes it really is that good! The historic decor just adds to the charm of what Sloan's claim is the oldest pub in Glasgow. I'd love to try the other items on the menu as well\n\nPlease, just go here. Don't question it, just do it. You'll be in for a good time one way or another. I wish I didn't live so far away, I know I'd be a more frequent visitor if I was based near Scotland",
