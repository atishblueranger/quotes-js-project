There's so much to see and learn-it can easily take a few hours to explore properly. Throughout the day, there are live shows and demonstrations which are not only educational but also fun, with audience participation that really brings the experience to life.\n\nIt's an engaging place for all ages, and my son particularly enjoyed it. It's a great day out for families, offering insight into the history and cultures of different parts of the world.\n\nOne downside is the café, which is on the pricey side. You might be better off walking down the road to find something more affordable to eat.\n\nOverall, a memorable and educational trip that's well worth the visit.",

The walk around Waterloo Lake was especially lovely, with ducks and swans, and loads of scenic spots to stop and take in the view. The Tropical World nearby is also well worth a visit if you've got kids or just fancy something a bit different.\n\nGreat facilities too – plenty of parking, clean toilets, and cafes dotted around for a coffee or snack.

            "text": "Roundhay Park is a beautiful green space at the heart of the community. The park has something for everyone – from wide open areas to relax, to fun attractions like the land train ride and play parks for children. The lake is perfect for a stroll, and feeding the ducks is always a favourite. There's a lovely café overlooking the water, and you'll often find an ice cream van nearby on sunny days. The park also hosts a variety of events throughout the year, including fairs and food festivals, which make every visit feel different and exciting. A vibrant and welcoming place",

            "text": "I went to the theater on my own, which was incredibly hard. I lost my wife to cancer just 6 months ago, and this is the kind of show she would have absolutely adored. We always loved going to different shows together, and I made a promise to her-to keep doing the things we loved, to keep living for the both of us.\n\nI watched Kinky Boots which was an absolute triumph – a show that's as bold and beautiful as it is moving and meaningful. From the moment the lights came up, I was completely captivated. The performances were phenomenal, the energy electric, and the story – oh, the story – struck right to the heart.\n\nAs a member of the LGBTQ community, this show resonated with me on such a personal level. I cried – not just at the emotional depth of the narrative, but because I saw parts of my own journey, as well as those of friends reflected on stage. The struggle for acceptance, the sting of rejection, the courage it takes to be unapologetically yourself – it was all there, handled with such authenticity, grace, and heart.\n\nBut what truly makes Kinky Boots so special is how it blends this deep emotional core with joy, humour, and hope. It's laugh-out-loud funny at times, wonderfully cheeky, and endlessly heartwarming. It reminds you that love, understanding, and acceptance really can change the world – one step at a time, in a fabulous pair of heels.\n\nThis wasn't just a show – it was a celebration of identity, resilience, and community. A standing ovation doesn't do it justice. If you have the chance to see it, do. It's a powerful, affirming, and unforgettable experience.\n\nSitting there alone was extremely painful, and I felt an overwhelming sadness when I arrived, missing my wife beside me so deeply. I cried quietly in the darkness, not just because of the show's moving moments, but because she wasn't there to share them.\n\nBut somehow, through the laughter, the music, and the message of hope and acceptance, the show gently lifted my spirits. It reminded me that joy can still be found, even through the grief, and for that, I'm truly grateful.\n\nThe cast of performers are fabulous! And the show made me miss going to drag shows with my sweet wife. We loved those!\n\nThe theatre itself is lovely. It has a real sense of character. Its period features and traditional charm give it a warm, welcoming feel, and the architecture adds a touch of elegance to the whole experience. The kind of place that adds to the enjoyment of the evening without overshadowing the performance itself.\n\nOverall, a fantastic experience.\n\nI've even booked myself a ticket to the Sounds of 60s show! And yes, alone but I can do this!",

The tropical house has so much to see and is far bigger than I ever expected.\nThe only negative I have to mention is a lot of the glass in the tanks is quite dirty so it can be hard to see the fish but I imagine this isn't an easy job to clean. This aside, we loved everything about it and will definitely be back.\nThe price is brilliant and even better if you have a max card, 1 adult goes free and under 3's are free too!\nWe ate in the cafe and food was freshly prepared and tasty, price wise I don't think it was too bad for what you got. Lots of space to eat and you can enjoy your own food in the outside picnic area!\nWe will definitely visit again.",

Would be helpful to have clearer guides/signs along the way for those with visual impairment (route directions, entry & exit signs between the different areas, high contrast on level changes). Café was nice; good variety of food at good prices, plenty of space around tables and lovely outdoor seating (two areas, one overlooking gardens). Would recommend",

Upon entering there was a lovely lady greeting us, more than happy to explain our tour around the museum. I'm guessing she had been stood there all day, but still so happy , showing great passion for her place of work. And rightly so once we made our way round, the place it was exceptional. We are museum geeks, visiting many. This was one of the best. The first floor with the animals, was lovely to see them inside glass protection. You could do a 180 to see all angles, get a real feel of there beauty. There was lots of interaction areas for younger children, my daughter is 12 still enjoyed this experience. As you climb the stairs/floors there was so many wonderful interest different topics. It was a really enjoyable experience, we went as a family , we all enjoyed it. You could easily spend a couple of hours taking in all the marvels. It truly was a surprise inside, do pay this museum a visit. It is tidy, clean & orderly. Definitely one of the best we have visited. No tickets or payment for entrance, donations can be made. Which we did, More than happy to support wonderful places like this .",

The place looks amazing - the decoration is beautiful and the whole vibe is perfect for a nice evening out (and great for photos too!).\n\nThe food was delicious, full of flavour and really well presented. But what made the whole experience even better was the service. Everyone was super friendly and welcoming, and they paid attention to all the little details without being over the top.\n\nShout out to Millie, who looked after us, she was fantastic. She knew the menu really well and took the time to explain things and make sure we felt comfortable with our choices. Really appreciated how patient and helpful she was.\n\nAll in all, it was a lovely experience and definitely good value for money. Would absolutely recommend and can't wait to go back!",

The server was lovely, but she did not write our orders down. Which I was already a tad worried about. She came back to recheck what drinks we asked for again as had forgotten.\n\nAfter a wait, our food came and she got the order wrong. We were given just poached eggs rather than the pulled pork we asked for. My partners meal only had 1 poached egg over, compared to the original 2 we were given, and the food had been reheated.\nEventually we got what we asked for, it was very lovely and I enjoyed it.\n\nThe mistakes on our fairly simple order wasn't great and could easily be rectified by writing down orders rather than trying to memorise it.\n\nWould go again on a less busy day,",
