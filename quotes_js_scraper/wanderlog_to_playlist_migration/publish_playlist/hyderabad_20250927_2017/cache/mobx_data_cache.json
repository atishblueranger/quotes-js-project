The first building with its architecture and interiors is worth seeing, but beyond that, not much stood out.\n\nThe best part of the visit was the collection of antique/vintage cars – well-maintained and impressive. Other sections felt repetitive and lacked engaging displays.\n\nGood for a short visit if you're nearby, but not a must-see unless you're a history or car enthusiast."

Just a short walk from the chaos of Charminar, it offers a completely different vibe - calm, quiet, and almost regal. The moment you see the palace from the outside, it takes your breath away. The soft, pastel colors of the building are incredibly soothing and elegant. Step inside, and you're greeted with stunning chandeliers hanging from intricately designed ceilings. One of the highlights was the vintage car and bike collection, which adds a unique charm to the experience. If you're anywhere near Charminar, don’t miss this peaceful spot."

              "reviewText": "The palace was constructed by Kamal Khan, and sold to the Nizam once he expressed his desire for the palace. The young Nizam moved in when he was only 13. After his accession to the throne in 1911, he continued to stay at the palace and did not move to Chowmahalla Palace where his father lived.\n\nIn the sprawling palace, various kinds of expensive items were stored in steel trunks, fastened with English-made padlocks.[3] The palace has three main buildings, divided into two groups. It also has a huge library used by the last Nizam.[4]\n\nThe eastern half, now occupied by a state government hospital, was used by the Nizam for official and ceremonial purposes. The western half, which is now walled, has the main residential buildings known as Nazri Bagh or Mubarak Mansion and still belongs to the Nizam’s private estate.\n\nThe main entrance to Nazri Bagh always had a curtain draped across it, so it has come to be known as the purdah gate. When Nizam ventured out of the palace, the purdah was lifted to indicate the king was not home. The gate was guarded by Maisaram Regiment, police and Sarf-e-Khas Army bearing lances.[5] The Nizam lived here until his death in 1967.[2]"

Lounges, waiting areas, and seating arrangements are top-notch, offering both convenience and style.\n\nWhat impressed me most was the attention to detail — be it the courteous staff, neatly maintained washrooms, or the wide variety of food and shopping options that cater to both domestic and international travelers. The runway and airside operations are equally impressive, showcasing precision and efficiency.\n\nHyderabad Airport isn’t just a transit hub, it’s an experience in itself. Truly world-class and setting a benchmark for how an international airport should be managed.\n\nRating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5) – A flawless blend of luxury, efficiency, and comfort."

              "reviewText": "Rajiv Gandhi International Airport is truly one of the cleanest and best-managed airports in India. The facilities are excellent, and the staff are polite, professional, and helpful, which makes the overall travel experience smooth.\n\nThe airport offers a wide variety of stalls and outlets to explore, with options for shopping, food, and leisure. The spa and bar areas are particularly noteworthy and add a premium touch for passengers looking to relax before their flights. Lounges are well-maintained and comfortable, though the menu tends to remain the same with limited choices — an area that could be improved to enhance the experience for frequent travelers.\n\nCleanliness is a major highlight here. The toilets are spotless and well-kept, which reflects the airport’s commitment to hygiene and passenger comfort.\n\nOne important area that requires immediate attention is the lack of proper information displays. From domestic security check-in up to the last gates, flight schedule boards are either limited or missing. This can create confusion for passengers, especially those on tight schedules. Installing more clear and visible digital displays throughout the terminal would significantly improve convenience.\n\nOverall, it is a modern airport with world-class facilities, clean infrastructure, and a pleasant ambiance. With just a few tweaks in information display and lounge variety, it can easily be rated among the very best airports globally."

Nestled near the iconic Charminar, this magnificent edifice was a harmonious blend of Mughal and Rajasthani architectural styles, reflecting the grandeur of its era.\n\nConstructed in 1845, the palace was renowned for its intricately carved wooden pavilion—a rarity in Hyderabad's architectural landscape. The use of imported teak wood added to its elegance, showcasing the artisans' unparalleled craftsmanship. The palace's design featured a traditional Hyderabadi courtyard, surrounded by overhanging wooden balconies adorned with delicate patterns, creating a serene and regal ambiance.\n\nHistorically, the Malwala family, to whom the palace belonged, served as the custodians of revenue records for the Nizam's dominions. This noble lineage added to the palace's significance, making it not just an architectural marvel but also a repository of history and heritage.\n\nRegrettably, in August 2000, much of this historic structure was demolished, leaving behind only memories of its former splendor. Today, while the physical edifice may no longer grace the streets of Hyderabad, the legacy of Malwala Palace endures in the annals of history, reminding us of a bygone era's elegance and cultural richness."

It was constructed in Mughal and Rajasthani style and in Hyderabadi courtyard style, was known for its richly carved. wooden pavilion. Other than Raja Bhagwandas Bagh Pavilion, Malwala Palace was the only other palace in Hyderabad having a wooden pavilion.Barring the grand gateway, the entire palace complex has been demolished in August 2000 and a shopping mall has been built in its place.\n\nThe Malwalas were responsible for the revenue records of the Nizam's dominions. The palace belonged to a noble family of Dewan Chandulal, the Malwala or the custodians of the Revenue Records (Daftar -i- Mal) of the erstwhile Hyderabad State. Built in the early 18th century by the noble Sagar Mall during the reign of first nizam in 1724, this was one of the very few palaces of Hyderabad built in the Mughal and Rajasthani styles of architecture. It acquired the name Malwala as Sagar Mall was the custodian of revenue records (maal) in hyderabad state. At the time department of revenue was held by the Mathur Kayastha family or Malwala family. During the 1940s, at the time of one of the family descendants, Raja Dharam Karan, the grandeur of the palace was resplendent and was noted for its glory and power.\n\nIt was an exquisite Diwan Khana made of huge arches in lacquered wood and painted with vegetable dyes and two galleries about 80 m in length flanking the Diwan Khana on each side constructed with Rangoon teak rafters. The galleries housed priceless collection of antique Indian art and artifacts. The palace also had a library, which boasted of a collection of rare books and manuscripts from the 10th century A.D. It is one of the few wooden edifices in the city, a double-storeyed mansion with inner courtyards, with its ornamental archway entrance rich in stucco work and a fountain at the centre. There were wooden pavilions on two sides and overhanging wooden balconies with intricate patterns in Rajasthani and Mughal architectural styles. The palace had two wings, the eastern part used for official business, celebrations and social functions and the western one for residential purpose. The eastern part extended to 2460 square metres with a beautiful cistern standing in the middle of the vast courtyard. It consisted of a series of galleries in two floors and a wooden pavilion, which like the Diwan-i-Khas of the Delhi Fort is \"an oriental magnificence in wood.\" Vegetable dyes were used for decorating the lacquered wood and the walls. Tragedy struck the Malwala Palace, a protected heritage building, having rare wooden pavilion considered the \"bride\" among the garland of palaces around Charminar when the major portion as important as the \"heart\" was reduced to rubble in 2000. The demolition occurred after disputes between a sections of the owners of the palace, some in collusion with real estate developers and politicians over maintaining heritage status of the building."

              "reviewText": "Purani Haveli, also known as Masarrat Mahal Palace, is a hidden gem nestled in Hyderabad, Telangana. Originally the official residence of the Nizam, this grand Haveli, also called Haveli Kadeem, meaning 'old mansion,' holds a significant slice of Hyderabad’s history. Constructed for Sikander Jah, Asaf Jah III, by his father Asaf Jah II, the architecture tells the tale of 18th-century European influence. It was initially acquired by the second Nizam, Mir Nizam Ali Khan, in 1717, from Rukunudhaulah of the Momin dynasty.\n\nThe palace complex has unique features, including the Ayina Khana (Mirror House) and Chini Khana (Chinese Glass House). The U-shaped Haveli has two parallel oblong wings, with a residential palace that sits perpendicularly at the center, creating a timeless design reminiscent of European palaces. The most extraordinary element is the world’s longest wardrobe, spanning an entire wing, built on two levels and equipped with a hand-cranked wooden elevator—a fascinating feature that reflects the opulence of the era.\n\nNotably, the sixth and seventh Nizams were born here and spent a part of their lives within its walls. Today, the Haveli houses the South Zone Deputy Commissioner of Police and Task Force offices. Although much of the palace has been converted into a school with restricted access, visitors can still explore the museum area for a nominal ticket fee, with an additional charge for photography.\n\nInside, four chambers are open to the public, mostly displaying gifts once presented to the Nizam. The fourth room, which holds the Nizam's wardrobe, is a marvel to behold. The entire visit can comfortably be completed in 30 to 45 minutes, offering a captivating peek into the life and legacy of Hyderabad’s royalty. A visit to Purani Haveli is a must for history lovers, as it weaves together Hyderabad’s regal past with a touch of architectural grandeur."

Post some robbery few years back, this museum doesn't have on display Nizam's famous jewelery. One needs around 1 hour to visit this place depending on one's love for art and artefacts and request for a guide who can quickly explain you various items on display. BE CAREFUL OF ONE ITEM - There is a picture of H E H Nizam VII with the then PM of India Mr Lal Bahadur Sastri with a caption claiming the Nizam gave 5,000 kgs of gold to National Defense Fund in 1965 post war. There are media reports clarifying that the Nizam only subscribed to 425 of gold bonds and did not give 5,000 kgs of gold."

As an NSG-1 category station within the Secunderabad railway division of the South Central Railway zone, it serves as a vital hub in the heart of Hyderabad, Telangana. This station, built in 1874 by the Nizam of Hyderabad, is not just a transportation nexus but a living monument to the region's illustrious past.\n\nThe architectural grandeur of Secunderabad Junction, influenced by Nizamesque design, is reminiscent of a fort, adding a unique charm to the bustling urban landscape of the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad. The main portico and concourse are particularly noteworthy, reflecting the station's historical significance and aesthetic appeal.\n\nEvery day, approximately 170,000 passengers traverse through this station, boarding or alighting from one of the 229 trains that pass through it. It is well connected to all regions of India, making it a pivotal point in the national railway network. The station's importance is further underscored by its status as the headquarters of both the South Central Railway zone and its Secunderabad Division.\n\nSecunderabad Junction has not only preserved its historical essence but also embraced modernity. The station has earned ISO-9001 certification for quality management in ticket booking, parcel and luggage booking, and platform management. Indian Railways has ambitious plans to upgrade this station to world-class standards, focusing on vertical expansion to cater to increasing passenger needs.\n\nDespite its historical significance and central role in the railway network, there are areas where improvements can be made. While the station's cleanliness has room for enhancement, ongoing renovations indicate a commitment to elevating the overall passenger experience.\n\nThe station's connectivity is exemplary, with the Hyderabad MMTS, Telangana State Road Transport Corporation buses, and the Hyderabad Metro ensuring seamless access to nearly all parts of the twin cities. As one of the top 100 booking stations in Indian Railways, Secunderabad Junction stands as a symbol of both heritage and progress.\n\nSecunderabad Junction is not merely a transit point but a destination in itself, embodying the spirit of India's railway heritage while continuously evolving to meet contemporary demands."

None of the display boards were working, we were only dependent on announcements and worried if we would miss the announcement in the noise. Adding to that there is a last minute change in the platform and delay in arrival of train.  Another surprise is that after the delay they had stopped only for 5 mins against the 10 min standard wait period. Witnessed lot senior citizens getting into other bhogis and walked to there seats."

Built in 1885 by the Prime Minister of Hyderabad, Sir Asman Jah, the palace was used as a summer retreat for the Nizam and his family. Today, the palace has been converted into a museum that showcases the rich history and culture of Hyderabad.\n\nAsman Garh Palace is an architectural marvel that reflects the European influence on Indian architecture during the 19th century. The palace is built in a mix of Gothic and Rajasthani styles, with a striking exterior that features a blend of intricate carvings, arches, and domes. The palace is surrounded by lush green gardens that offer breathtaking views of the city below.\n\nThe museum inside the palace is a treasure trove of Hyderabad's history and culture, with exhibits that include vintage cars, weaponry, textiles, and furniture. The vintage cars collection includes a Rolls Royce, a Cadillac, and a Mercedes, all of which were used by the Nizams. The weaponry collection includes a variety of swords, daggers, and guns, while the textiles exhibit showcases the rich weaving and embroidery traditions of Hyderabad.\n\nAsman Garh Palace is also known for its panoramic views of Hyderabad, making it a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. The palace is especially breathtaking at sunset, when the orange and pink hues of the sky create a magical backdrop against the palace's Gothic architecture.\n\nOverall, Asman Garh Palace is a must-visit destination for anyone interested in Hyderabad's rich history and culture. Its stunning architecture, lush gardens, and fascinating exhibits make it a memorable experience for visitors of all ages."

After that converted to an orphanage for a brief period of time. The palace presently is converted into a school (St Joseph's Public School, Asman Garh Palace branch). Located near the TV tower at Malakpet, the Asmangarh Palace was constructed in 1885 by the Paigah Noble Sir Asman Jah.\n\nThe Asmangarh Palace is located on a hillock with a commanding view of the surrounding forest, which served as a hunting preserve for the Nizam and his courtiers. The Nizam was so fascinated by this miniature castle that he became a regular visitor. Sir Asman Jah eventually gave it to the Nizam. It was designed personally and built by the erstwhile Prime Minister of Hyderabad state Sir Asman Jah in 1885 on a hillock for leisure. He belonged to the Paigah family. He fulfilled his dream of building a home close to the sky. It is believed that there is a tunnel (Underground way) in the basement of the building leading to the Golkonda Fort.\n\nUnused for quite some time, the palace was leased to the Birlas who located their Archaeological Museum in it. After more than four decades, the Birla Museum moved out and the building is now under the management of St. Joseph's Education Society (St. Joseph's School, Asmangadh palace branch), which has bought the building in the year 2000 and runs a branch of the main school (at King Kothi).They have added a new four-storied building, in front of the villa."

While the climb to the summit can be demanding, the panoramic view of Hyderabad is a rewarding spectacle.  The unique acoustic system, demonstrable by clapping at the entrance and hearing the echo at the top, is noteworthy.For an enhanced experience, an evening visit is recommended to witness the light and sound show, which eloquently narrates the fort's history.  Given the extensive walking involved, comfortable shoes and water are essential.  Golconda Fort is a must-see destination for any visitor to Hyderabad."

We observed a lot of youngsters and even foreign tourists exploring the area.\n\nPlease note, there is no food court inside the fort, so it’s good to carry water or light snacks. The entry ticket costs ₹25, which is quite reasonable for such a historic and scenic place.\n\nAs we climbed to the top of the fort, the cool breeze and panoramic view of the city made the effort completely worth it. From the top, we could see a large part of Hyderabad. A special moment was witnessing a peacock dancing in the forested area below, which we spotted from the top — truly magical!\n\nThere are also two temples inside the fort area that add to its cultural charm:\n\nA Yellamma temple, which looks beautiful and peaceful.\n\nAnother Mahankali temple, located near the top of the fort, which is especially impressive — it’s carved from a single stone, and its architecture stands out."

Walking through its gates and pathways gives a real sense of Hyderabad’s rich history. The acoustic system and panoramic views from the top are remarkable.\n\nThat said, parts of the fort could have been restored better to preserve its grandeur. Some areas look neglected, which slightly takes away from the overall experience.\n\nStill, it’s a must-visit if you’re in Hyderabad — both for the historical significance and the breathtaking views of the city. Go early morning or evening to avoid the heat and enjoy it fully."

The climb to the top involves quite a few steps, but it's worth the effort for the amazing scenery and breeze.\n\nThe sound and light show in the evening is a highlight—it beautifully narrates the fort’s rich history. The acoustics of the fort, especially the clap echo at the entrance, are fascinating and show the engineering brilliance of that time.\n\nIt's best to visit in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and carry water. The fort is well-maintained, and guides are available for those who want to know the detailed history.\n\nBest For: History lovers, photography enthusiasts, and anyone looking to explore Hyderabad's heritage."

Plan to spend at least four hours here, but avoid visiting late in the evening as ticket counters close early. This 16th-century citadel, built by the Qutb Shahi dynasty, is renowned for its ingenious acoustics, grand architecture, and strategic design. Once home to the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond, it offers panoramic views and a deep dive into India’s rich medieval heritage.\n\nThis is my personal experience\nLimited photos uploaded"

              "reviewText": "This is a huge place, and you will need to do quite a bit of walking, so it’s better to visit during the monsoon or winter seasons. It is located a little outside the city, around 12 km away. Hiring a guide is highly recommended, otherwise, you may find it less engaging. A guide usually charges around ₹1000 for the complete tour.\n\nThe fort, originally called Golla Konda and later known as Golkonda, has a rich history. It was first built by the Kakatiyas, then controlled by the Bahmanis, followed by the Qutb Shahi dynasty. After Aurangzeb’s attack, it eventually came under the rule of the Nizams.\n\nWith a guide, you’ll get to learn about the fort’s architecture, where people used to live, and other fascinating details. Exploring the entire fort generally takes about 1.5 hours."

Just a short walk from the chaos of Charminar, it offers a completely different vibe - calm, quiet, and almost regal. The moment you see the palace from the outside, it takes your breath away. The soft, pastel colors of the building are incredibly soothing and elegant. Step inside, and you're greeted with stunning chandeliers hanging from intricately designed ceilings. One of the highlights was the vintage car and bike collection, which adds a unique charm to the experience. If you're anywhere near Charminar, don’t miss this peaceful spot."

The reasoning behind this is unclear and feels unfair.\n•\tThey also charge ₹50 just to carry a mobile phone, but you’re only allowed to click photos. If you want to take videos, you have to pay an additional ₹200, which seems unreasonable.\n\nOverall, the place is worth visiting for its history and beauty, but the unnecessary charges take away from the experience."

This historical monument truly lives up to its reputation as the heart of Hyderabad. The first thing that caught my attention was the sheer beauty of the structure – its magnificent arches, minarets, and the overall grandeur that takes you back in time. It’s not just a monument but an emotion for the city.\n\nAlthough there was a huge crowd, I was impressed with how well the local authorities and the Government of Hyderabad managed the place. From cleanliness to crowd control, everything seemed organized, which allowed visitors like me to enjoy the site without any hassle.\n\nThe surroundings of Charminar are equally lively. There are countless mini shops and street stalls selling everything from colorful bangles, dresses, and shoes to small souvenirs that perfectly capture the essence of Hyderabad. For a food lover like me, this place is heaven. The lanes are filled with aromatic food stalls and restaurants serving delicious dishes, especially the famous Mandi, chicken delicacies, and Hyderabadi specialties that you just cannot miss.\n\nOverall, my visit to Charminar was a blend of history, culture, and flavors. It’s a place where tradition meets modernity, and every corner has something to offer. I would highly recommend everyone to visit this place at least once in their lifetime. Whether you love history, shopping, or food – Charminar has it all."

              "reviewText": "Among the many heritage treasures of Hyderabad, Toli Masjid, also fondly known as Damri Masjid, stands out for its unique history and architectural charm. Built in 1671 by Musa Khan, the royal chamberlain and minister under Abdullah Qutb Shah, this mosque reflects both devotion and ingenuity. Musa Khan, who was also entrusted with overseeing the construction of the grand Makkah Masjid, is remembered for his generosity, every time he saved one Damri (a small coin) from the mosque’s construction costs, he invested it in building this mosque. Hence, it came to be called the Damri Masjid.\n\nArchitecturally, the mosque is a true marvel of Qutb Shahi craftsmanship. Resting on an elevated platform, the structure features two tall minarets and four smaller ones, three graceful domes crowning the prayer hall, and five distinct archways leading into the sanctum. The symmetrical balance of arches, minarets, and domes showcases the elegance of Deccan architecture, blending simplicity with grandeur. The intricate stucco work and finely proportioned details mirror the Qutb Shahi style seen in Hyderabad’s other great monuments.\n\nDespite being less visited than the Charminar or Makkah Masjid, Toli Masjid remains an enduring reminder of devotion, humility, and artistic excellence. Its story of being born out of a chamberlain’s savings adds a soul-stirring dimension to its beauty. Standing before this mosque, one realizes that true heritage is not just built of stone, but of faith, sacrifice, and timeless artistry."

Coming from the Midwest, we questioned several aspects of the design that Raj suggested. Thank God we listened to him because living in the Southwest is completely different from living in the Midwest and his suggestions turned out to be very important.  Since the day we moved in, we wake up every morning and Thank God and Raj for the beautiful home that we live in.  Raj was exceptionally educated on what designs work in the Southwest especially with our extreme weather conditions.  He was professional and was always on time with the deadlines as well as our numerous meetings. He introduced so many new ideas and concepts and is truly a genius at architectural design.  He was delightful to work with and we have maintained a friendship ever since. I think you will find that anyone who has ever worked with Raj will give him the same outstanding grade that we give him A! We have never met any of Raj's customers who do not say the same thing about him."

              "reviewText": "Hussain Sagar Lake is one of Hyderabad’s most iconic and scenic spots — a perfect blend of history, relaxation, and city views. Built in the 16th century, it still serves as a calm escape right in the middle of the urban chaos.\n\nThe highlight is the massive Buddha statue located on a small island in the center of the lake. The boat ride to the statue is peaceful and gives a lovely view of the water and skyline. The calmness on the island offers a moment of quiet reflection — especially beautiful around sunset.\n\nThe lakefront, especially near Tank Bund and Necklace Road, is great for long evening walks, cycling, or just sitting on the benches watching the water. The area is usually breezy, and when the city lights start to reflect on the water after dusk, the view becomes magical. It’s also well-decorated with statues, small parks, fountains, and street vendors.\n\nThere are nearby attractions too — Lumbini Park, Eat Street, Sanjeevaiah Park, and the Light & Sound show — making it a good family-friendly outing.\n\nThat said, a few things pull the experience down just a little. The water quality of the lake isn’t great, and at times you may notice pollution or smell. Crowds can be heavy on weekends, and the traffic around the lake can get intense. But none of these spoil the overall charm.\n\nRating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)\nA must-visit place in Hyderabad for its peaceful vibe, boat rides, and city views. Great for couples, families, and tourists — just visit during early mornings or evenings to avoid heat and traffic."

What followed was a close interaction, timely support and hold: Excellent desings and finest elevations, with detailing to the last T. Our firm then had another opportunity to undertake a turnkey project. The promoters of the project had designs sent by most reputed architects. However, the designs finalized by GS Studio were very much liked. In six months, we were able to complete the project, ahead of schedule, thanks to the timely support rendered by GS Studio.\nAs they say, no single individual is better than a team, here we are. We had a team of engineers supporting us timely and their principal architect was always willing to help us with suggestions that would save us time and cost.\nAll in all, GS Studio has all the ingredients to make some of the finest architects from the states of TN & AP and their works are well recommended for anyone interested in unique design concepts"

Spread over a massive area, this place truly lives up to its reputation as the world’s largest film studio complex. From the moment we entered, we were immersed in a world of creativity, glamour, and cinematic wonder.\n\nThe guided tour was very well-organized, taking us through breathtaking film sets, beautiful gardens, and elaborate theme locations. Each corner felt like a scene from a blockbuster movie! The Bahubali set was a personal favorite – absolutely stunning and meticulously detailed.\n\nThe live shows, including stunt performances and dance sequences, added so much energy and entertainment to the day. The staff was courteous and helpful, and the overall cleanliness and maintenance of the place were impressive.\n\nWhether you're a movie buff or just looking for a fun-filled day with family or friends, Ramoji Film City is a must-visit. It's not just a destination – it's an experience full of imagination, excitement, and joy. Highly recommended!"

Different set visit is also great(including Bahubali set). After visiting I might know how those difficult scenes are created :).

Morning pickup wil be easy if u book AC bus along booking, but evening it will be started only at 7pm, but we can exit at 5.30 pm itself so it won't be suitable for drop. Plenty of cabs will be available at gate for drop. Booked directly using website, no discount in any other brokerages.\nOverall very nice experience. But u need more energy to walk, travel by bus inside studio and exploration interest."

From there one needs to board different buses that you to different action areas. Generally the area is divided into 5 sections where these buses stops so that people can experience it.\nTo start with we have the Backlight show, which according to me can be skipped. Then we move on to Filmy duniya, where they explain how a scene is shot along with how the different background sounds are generated. From there we were taken to the famous set of the movie Bahubali, from there we were taken to the set of the movie Matka, where one could also enjoy some adventure sports. From there we were taken to a area where they showed how animations were created from a real life person moving around.\nThen we were taken to the European area where the staged up buildings were supposed to give you a feel of Europe, which failed miserably!\nThen we were led to Butterfly and amazon forest area where butterflies and birds are roaming freely. The place has a lot of different restaurants and hotels as well."

The theme park rides and attractions were also a blast, and the cultural performances added a touch of traditional Indian flair.\n\nWhile the extensive walking involved in the tour can be tiring, the experience is well worth it.\nRecommend visiting on a weekday to avoid crowds and taking breaks to stay hydrated.\n\nMany juice shops and restaurants available inside. Anyway carrying water bottles and cap is must. Very sunny during the day time.\n\nOverall, Ramoji Film City is an unforgettable experience that combines entertainment, adventure, and culture. Highly recommended for families, film enthusiasts, and thrill-seekers alike!\"\n\nKids love to visit Bahubali set and they definitely love this experience and bus ride. 🚌\n\nDon't miss the last stunt performance.

Other sections felt repetitive and lacked engaging displays.\n\nGood for a short visit if you're nearby, but not a must-see unless you're a history or car enthusiast."

One of the highlights was the vintage car and bike collection, which adds a unique charm to the experience. If you're anywhere near Charminar, don’t miss this peaceful spot."

The fort is well-maintained and attracts many visitors, especially on weekends. We observed a lot of youngsters and even foreign tourists exploring the area.\n\nPlease note, there is no food court inside the fort, so it’s good to carry water or light snacks. The entry ticket costs ₹25, which is quite reasonable for such a historic and scenic place.\n\nAs we climbed to the top of the fort, the cool breeze and panoramic view of the city made the effort completely worth it. From the top, we could see a large part of Hyderabad. A special moment was witnessing a peacock dancing in the forested area below, which we spotted from the top — truly magical!\n\nThere are also two temples inside the fort area that add to its cultural charm:\n\nA Yellamma temple, which looks beautiful and peaceful.\n\nAnother Mahankali temple, located near the top of the fort, which is especially impressive — it’s carved from a single stone, and its architecture stands out."

Walking through its gates and pathways gives a real sense of Hyderabad’s rich history. The acoustic system and panoramic views from the top are remarkable.\n\nThat said, parts of the fort could have been restored better to preserve its grandeur. Some areas look neglected, which slightly takes away from the overall experience.\n\nStill, it’s a must-visit if you’re in Hyderabad — both for the historical significance and the breathtaking views of the city. Go early morning or evening to avoid the heat and enjoy it fully."

Plan to spend at least four hours here, but avoid visiting late in the evening as ticket counters close early. This 16th-century citadel, built by the Qutb Shahi dynasty, is renowned for its ingenious acoustics, grand architecture, and strategic design. Once home to the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond, it offers panoramic views and a deep dive into India’s rich medieval heritage.\n\nThis is my personal experience\nLimited photos uploaded"

It is located a little outside the city, around 12 km away. Hiring a guide is highly recommended, otherwise, you may find it less engaging. A guide usually charges around ₹1000 for the complete tour.\n\nThe fort, originally called Golla Konda and later known as Golkonda, has a rich history. It was first built by the Kakatiyas, then controlled by the Bahmanis, followed by the Qutb Shahi dynasty. After Aurangzeb’s attack, it eventually came under the rule of the Nizams.\n\nWith a guide, you’ll get to learn about the fort’s architecture, where people used to live, and other fascinating details. Exploring the entire fort generally takes about 1.5 hours."

The mission started with health check ups at Asian Institute of Gastroenterology (AIG)  and passing our post retirement days at son's abode. This morning we spent an enjoyable pair of hours at botanical garden of Hyderabad. The experience is lovely and lively. Entry fee per adult is 40 Rs only and parking charges for 4 and 2 wheelers are@ Rs 40 and Rs 20 per hour respectively. And there is even a card system costing Rs 1500/- per year per Sr citizen. At the entry side there is a beautiful icecream and tea/coffee parlour with variety of tea (19 types) and coffee (11 types , the highest value of coffee costs@ Rs 200/- per mug). The inside is belted by circular pathways of a stretch of 2.88 Km where morning and evening walkers throng to rush, race,run , walk and roam to enjoy in the thick of nature beautified with trees , plants, bushes and flora ; number of spots, viz parks,gardens of different kinds ( orchid, bonsai,teak, butterfly, and the likes), fountains, open air gym centres fitted with different accessories for almost whole body exercise separately marked for sr citzens ,women, youngsters at no separate cost ; green meadows with soft and clean beds of grasses; amphitheatre, food courts serving different types of fresh juices including those of cucumber, pumpkin, bitter gourd etc at a cost of Rs 50 l- per paper glass; amusement zones catered with sporting events ( sky-cycling in rope ways, boating in artificial water ways , swindlers, hip-hops and many others. The sky cycling demands a cost of Rs 100 /-). You can manage to travel the entire area in a specially built 7 seater 8 wheeler at a cost of Rs 60/- with concessions for children and Rs 160/- per family for a duration of 1 hour.) , There are enough seating arrangements in the sideways, toilets and drinking facilities. There are some cottages inside but since 2018 these are not offered to the visitors. You can even visit a small spot with description and representation of evolution of plant kingdom starting from algae, ferns, bryophyte, pteridophytes etc upto grasses ( bamboos ). The undoubtedly pleasing most attractions are the trees and plants of different species.\nI strongly recommend the visitors of the city of Hyderabad to include this site in their itinerary."

The layout of the garden was well thought out, making it easy to navigate and explore. Each section showcased different types of flora, from stunning tropical plants to elegant flowers and even serene water features. The various themed gardens added a unique touch, allowing us to appreciate the diversity of plant life.\n\nWalking through the garden with my friends made the experience even more enjoyable. We took our time to admire the beauty around us, stopped for photos, and shared fun facts about the plants we encountered. The ambiance was peaceful, making it a perfect spot for relaxation and enjoying nature.\n\nOne of the highlights was the array of seasonal blooms – we visited during a time when everything seemed to be in full bloom, creating a colorful tapestry that was simply breathtaking. We also enjoyed the little nooks and cozy seating areas scattered throughout, where we could sit and soak in the beauty around us.\n\nThe staff at the botanical garden were friendly and knowledgeable, willing to answer our questions and provide insights about the different species on display. We even participated in a guided tour, which enriched our understanding of the plants and their ecological significance.\n\nOverall, visiting the botanical garden was a memorable outing with my friends. It was a wonderful way to connect with nature, unwind, and appreciate the beauty of the environment. I highly recommend anyone looking for a day of exploration and tranquility to pay a visit. It's not just for plant enthusiasts; there's something magical for everyone!"

              "reviewText": "The Hyderabad Botanical Garden is truly one of the finest places in the city where nature, peace, and beauty all come together. Spread across a vast area near Kondapur, this garden is a paradise for anyone who wants to escape the chaos of daily life and spend some quality time surrounded by greenery. It is not just a park, but a carefully designed space that showcases the rich biodiversity of plants, trees, flowers, and wildlife.\n\nFrom the very entrance, the garden greets you with fresh air and a calming atmosphere. The pathways are wide and neat, lined with tall trees that provide shade and coolness even on sunny days. As you walk further inside, you can feel the stress slowly melting away and being replaced with a sense of peace and connection with nature.\n\nThe garden is divided into multiple sections, each with its own charm. The Miyawaki forest area is one of the highlights — it is densely packed with fast-growing native trees, making it look like a mini forest right in the middle of the city. Walking through this section feels like entering a natural sanctuary where birds are chirping, butterflies are fluttering, and the air feels fresher than ever.\n\nThe bamboo section is another attraction worth mentioning. Tall, green bamboo groves sway gently with the breeze, creating a soothing sound that is so relaxing to listen to. It almost feels like being transported into a different world, far away from the traffic and noise of Hyderabad.\n\nThe butterfly park is one of the most loved spots, especially for children and photographers. Colorful butterflies can be seen flying around, adding life and vibrancy to the garden. This section is both educational and visually delightful. The variety of flowering plants attracts not only butterflies but also bees and small birds, making it a hub of natural activity.\n\nThere are also medicinal and ornamental plant sections, which are very informative. Each plant has a board with details, so visitors can learn about its uses and origin. For students and nature lovers, this is like a living classroom where you can see rare species up close.\n\nThe water bodies and small ponds inside the garden add to the charm. The sight of water lilies, aquatic plants, and the calm reflection of trees in the water make it a perfect spot to sit and relax. Early mornings and evenings are particularly magical here, with soft sunlight making the garden glow beautifully.\n\nThe Botanical Garden is not only about plants, but also about space for people. The walking and jogging tracks are perfect for fitness lovers, while families often come here for picnics. There are plenty of benches and shaded spots to sit and relax. The wide lawns provide children a safe place to play, and couples or groups can enjoy peaceful conversations without any disturbance.\n\nAnother wonderful thing about the garden is the birdlife. If you are lucky, you can spot peacocks, parrots, kingfishers, and many other local bird species. For bird watchers and photographers, this place is nothing short of heaven.\n\nMaintenance of the garden is commendable. Despite being spread over such a large area, the cleanliness is well taken care of, and the plants are nurtured properly. Seasonal flower shows and plantation drives organized here make the place even more colorful and lively.\n\nIn short, the Hyderabad Botanical Garden is not just a tourist attraction, but an experience of calmness, learning, and connection with nature. It’s an ideal destination for morning walkers, students, researchers, families, couples, and even solo visitors who want to spend peaceful time amidst nature.\n\nIf you are in Hyderabad and haven’t visited this garden yet, you are truly missing out on one of the city’s greenest treasures. It’s a reminder that in the middle of our busy urban lives, there still exists a space where you can slow down, breathe deeply, and enjoy the simple joys of nature. 🌳🌸🦋✨"

Tickets had to be purchased by scanning a QR code, as the payment mode was completely online.\n\nThe place is quite spacious and well-maintained. One of the highlights for me was the Top Spin ride—absolutely thrilling and worth trying! The rides around the Top Spin area were priced at ₹80 each, which was quite affordable considering the fun.\n\nWhile outside lunch isn't allowed, you can carry snacks and water inside, which was convenient. The overall vibe was lively, and it’s a good place for families or groups of friends to hang out.\n\nParking is also well-managed, with separate charges:\n\nBicycle: ₹5\n\nTwo-wheeler: ₹15\n\nThree-wheeler: ₹20\n\nFour-wheeler: ₹50\n\nMini bus/van: ₹150–₹250"

              "reviewText": "A Refreshing Escape in the Heart of Hyderabad!\n\nI visited NTR Gardens two days ago, and I must say, it was a fantastic experience! Located near Hussain Sagar Lake, this beautiful park offers the perfect blend of nature, relaxation, and a splash of fun. The lush greenery, well-maintained landscapes, and peaceful atmosphere make it a great place to unwind from the city’s hustle and bustle.\n\nThe walking paths are spacious, the gardens are colorful with a variety of flowers, and the entire area is very clean. What I loved the most was the peaceful vibe—ideal for families, couples, or even solo visitors just looking to enjoy some quiet time in nature.\n\nThere are plenty of benches to sit and relax, fun rides for kids, and even a small food court to grab a quick bite. The entry fee is minimal, and the value you get in return is amazing.\n\nHighly recommended if you're visiting Hyderabad or looking for a serene hangout spot with a beautiful view and refreshing environment. NTR Gardens truly lives up to its name as one of the city’s finest green spaces!"

Definitely a must-see in Hyderabad.\n\nTimings:\nWeekdays (Monday to Saturday) - 2:30 PM to 8:30 PM.\nSundays and Public Holidays - 12:30 PM to 8:30 PM.\n\nEntry Fees:\nAdults -  20/- rupees.\nChildren -  10/- rupees (typically ages 3-12)."

Cracked pavement, a strange lack of greenery or flowers, and completely broken, haunted looking rides for children. Huge, rusty bits of something just strewn around. There’s a garbage pile outside the fence that stinks. I looked it up and it’s about 25 years old, but it looks like it was abandoned 25 years ago. I’d sooner let children play with stray animals than use these rides. One appears to have been replaced with an inflatable slide. It was comically bad. Not worth Rs. 20.\nP.S. Hyderabad is great. Just go to the lake across the street and miss this park."

There are options to buy tickets online and offline.\n\nEveryone is welcome there, individual, couple, children, family.\n\nNote for couples - Be good in public so nobody feels awkward, also children will be there to learn from you. So just keep a good environment.\n\nThere are many activities going on daily but they all are billed separately which you can enjoy like, boating in a small place, horror house, games. You can also enjoy pizzas, samosas, golgappe aka panipuri and many fast food and street food items."

This historical monument truly lives up to its reputation as the heart of Hyderabad. The first thing that caught my attention was the sheer beauty of the structure – its magnificent arches, minarets, and the overall grandeur that takes you back in time. It’s not just a monument but an emotion for the city.\n\nAlthough there was a huge crowd, I was impressed with how well the local authorities and the Government of Hyderabad managed the place. From cleanliness to crowd control, everything seemed organized, which allowed visitors like me to enjoy the site without any hassle.\n\nThe surroundings of Charminar are equally lively. There are countless mini shops and street stalls selling everything from colorful bangles, dresses, and shoes to small souvenirs that perfectly capture the essence of Hyderabad. For a food lover like me, this place is heaven. The lanes are filled with aromatic food stalls and restaurants serving delicious dishes, especially the famous Mandi, chicken delicacies, and Hyderabadi specialties that you just cannot miss.\n\nOverall, my visit to Charminar was a blend of history, culture, and flavors. It’s a place where tradition meets modernity, and every corner has something to offer. I would highly recommend everyone to visit this place at least once in their lifetime. Whether you love history, shopping, or food – Charminar has it all."

I wish a park was made in this place with benches and plants to enjoy it more. The lake is mostly clear, but in the entry areas of the lake lots of plastic garbage is thrown, so to preserve this beautiful lake, something should be done to take care of its surroundings and clean the place etc. Awaiting improvement in this place."

The lake spans approximately 83 acres and sits peacefully behind ancient granite rock formations that date back millions of years .\n\nHistorically, Durgam Cheruvu served as a crucial water source for the Golconda Fort under the Qutb Shahi dynasty—giving it both historical importance and a sense of timeless allure . Today, it has evolved beautifully thanks to thoughtful beautification efforts: you’ll find landscaped gardens, a rock garden, an artificial waterfall, floating fountain, paved walkways for about 2 km, and even an amphitheater that seats up to 1,500 people .\n\nFor those seeking relaxing or active outings, the lakefront is ideal. Go boating—from mechanized boats and speedboats to pedal boats, water scooters, and more—and enjoy scenic views of the surroundings while floating on the water . Adventure lovers can trek, enjoy rock climbing, rappelling, and even explore an art gallery and sculptor’s park nearby . Birdwatchers will also appreciate that around 149 bird species have been recorded here as of mid-2024 .\n\nOne of the most striking modern additions is the Durgam Cheruvu Cable Bridge—an elegant extradosed bridge connecting Jubilee Hills and Madhapur, opening up travel, while also adding a dramatic visual element to the lakefront . At night, it's lit with colorful lights and accompanied by musical fountains, making for a magical experience .\n\nFor visitors, timing and access are easy: the lakefront park is typically open from early morning (around 5 AM) to late evening (around 8 PM), with boating starting shortly after (around 9 AM) until evening . Entry is free or minimal—boating costs vary depending on type, but overall, the experience is very accessible . The peaceful ambiance, along with cafes and restaurants nearby (like Olive Bistro, Last House Coffee, etc.), makes it perfect for everything from a solo escape to a family outing or date night .\n\nBeyond its scenic and recreational appeal, Durgam Cheruvu also hosts events like the annual “Inorbit Durgam Cheruvu Run” and has even been a location for Formula E car unveilings and cultural performances . And with an ongoing focus on preservation—GHMC is working to resolve encroachment issues with a recent High Court directive—the lake’s ecological integrity is actively being safeguarded ."

Wanting to add one more Indian destination that I have traveled to, this venture was on. It would be fun to explore Hyderabad that reveals an exciting blend of cultures, history, and modernity like nothing else does.\n\nYes, there’s certainly lots to see and do in and around Hyderabad. The Chaumalla Palace, Charminar, Golconda fort, shopping for bangles and the Irani chai with Osmania biscuits that melt in your mouth. Yes, there was more….\n\nVisit Salar Jung Museum Hyderabad\n\nThe Salar Jung Museum is an art museum located at Dar-ul-Shifa, on the southern bank of the Musi River in the city of Hyderabad, Telangana, India.

Built in the 16th century, it still serves as a calm escape right in the middle of the urban chaos.\n\nThe highlight is the massive Buddha statue located on a small island in the center of the lake. The boat ride to the statue is peaceful and gives a lovely view of the water and skyline. The calmness on the island offers a moment of quiet reflection — especially beautiful around sunset.\n\nThe lakefront, especially near Tank Bund and Necklace Road, is great for long evening walks, cycling, or just sitting on the benches watching the water. The area is usually breezy, and when the city lights start to reflect on the water after dusk, the view becomes magical. It’s also well-decorated with statues, small parks, fountains, and street vendors.\n\nThere are nearby attractions too — Lumbini Park, Eat Street, Sanjeevaiah Park, and the Light & Sound show — making it a good family-friendly outing.\n\nThat said, a few things pull the experience down just a little. The water quality of the lake isn’t great, and at times you may notice pollution or smell. Crowds can be heavy on weekends, and the traffic around the lake can get intense. But none of these spoil the overall charm.\n\nRating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)\nA must-visit place in Hyderabad for its peaceful vibe, boat rides, and city views. Great for couples, families, and tourists — just visit during early mornings or evenings to avoid heat and traffic."

Construction of this grand mosque began in 1617 under the rule of Sultan Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the fifth ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty, and was completed in 1694 during the reign of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb.\n\nWhat makes it truly fascinating is that the mosque’s foundation stones were said to be made using sacred soil brought all the way from Mecca, hence the name Makkah Masjid. It took 77 years to build, involving thousands of workers and skilled artisans.\n\nStanding tall beside the iconic Charminar, Makkah Masjid is one of the largest and oldest mosques in India, capable of accommodating over 10,000 worshippers at once. The majestic granite structure, intricately carved arches, and grand minarets reflect the timeless elegance of Qutb Shahi and Mughal architecture blended together.\n\nAdding to its historical significance, the mosque complex also houses the graves of the Asaf Jahi royal family, including the tombs of several Nizams of Hyderabad, making it not just a place of worship but also a resting ground for Hyderabad’s royal heritage.\n\nIt is more than just a monument — it’s a spiritual landmark and a symbol of Hyderabad’s rich culture. A visit to Charminar feels incomplete without experiencing the peace, history, and grandeur of Makkah Masjid. An absolute must-visit for anyone exploring the old city of Hyderabad."

Helpful tour guide to show me the kabrs of famous royalty on marble walkway and showed me the structure of the mosque and told me about the history.  He wasn't free though, insisted on payment 500rs. Also promoted me to pay the cleaner at kabra. There's also a lady outside entrance to kabrs (only way to get mosque inside) who watches your shoes whil3 you're inside (doesnt demand payment but there is an expectation to give her something). Once inside, it was peaceful. Wudu areas and toilets are far from salaah area, so take towel with to dry body with. Enjoyed making thuhr, and the musalli's were friendly. Real spiritual place, glad that I visited it, just put off by the red tape and expectations of payment."

I felt the area was mowed and did landscaping, could not see any  Botanical Garden qualities. Even tree names were not displayed everywhere. 20- 30 minutes walk would be enough to see the whole park. The only so-called attraction is the cactus place. Even that is abused by passers by. I went there seeking a 5 km forest like  walk area with free roaming peacock views. But that area- now termed as a theme park,   is completely closed, and to enter we require walkers monthly pass. Walking time is from 4 PM - 5 PM. Buggy rides will also take you inside the theme park, but you won't be allowed to get down if the buggy ride. The theme park is not yet completed. A lot of forest is being cut down. I hope the 'theme' is going to compensate for the lost forest. Even inside the Botanical Garden, insects and birds variety seems to be very little. Habitat loss is kind of huge I guess. You can find lots of dogs and peacocks inside the theme park.\nWell it's impressive that a green space exists amidst concrete jungle!\nAdult ticket fee- ₹40/-\nBuggy ride per person-₹60/-\nIs ₹100/- worth? Depends on your priority; if you want to just enjoy some green time- yeah totally worth it,\nEnvironmentalist?- please don't bother.\nWaste management of the facility- top notch- Waste Collection centre is overflowing."

              "reviewText": "**A Refreshing Experience at the Botanical Garden 🌿**\n\nI recently visited the Botanical Garden and had an absolutely amazing experience. It's a *must-visit* destination for nature lovers—especially during the rainy season when the cool weather adds a special charm to the entire place.\n\nThe garden is home to a variety of medicinal plants, beautifully maintained and thoughtfully labeled, making it both relaxing and educational. One of the highlights was spotting numerous peacocks roaming freely, adding a magical touch to the serene surroundings.\n\nFor those who wish to visit often, annual passes are available. Some specific areas within the garden are reserved exclusively for annual pass holders, which makes them even more appealing for people who want a quieter, more private experience.\n\nThe overall maintenance of the garden is excellent, making the visit comfortable and enjoyable. Whether you're a botany enthusiast or simply someone who enjoys spending time in nature, this place won't disappoint."

It is very well maintained, well located and very peaceful places to visit any time of the day.\nAlong with nature walk and many birds. Special attraction is peacocks, many and many of them. They have open gym yoga center and many other attractions for just 40 rupee entry fee.\nClose siting of peacock garden requires monthly or yearly pass.\n\nThey have sky cycling, zip lining and other activities for adults and kids. Sometimes shows also are available about wild life. We saw show about snakes during our visit."

This place has the ability to became a good tourist attraction\n\nI have seen people doing fishing in the lake as well .\n\nThere is  one devi mata temple  as well , on that temple every year a fest is organised .where people present their offerning to devi maa. I have seen many truck there with beautiful artwork and people were cooking food outside the temple in different groups"

But the real beauty is riding or driving around the lake on the road that surrounds it. The lake is clean and swimming and diving are NOT allowed. There are numerous fields around the lake which give a pleasant feeling as you get out of Hyderabad city. They are like natural picnic spots and fun to visit with friends. Also, the Hidden Castle resort is nearby. There is security at the dam, but around the lake there is no security, so be careful while moving around."

There will be  none to disturb you . There is an exhibition ground on the road. Most of the time, some event is on. A little further is the water world.It is excellent for a nice walk at night where the roads would be lit and you can see the statue of Buddha. The eat street at neckalce road is also a must go place which is meant for food lovers. when looked from a higher altitude, this road looks like a necklace around the lake, hence named as Necklace Road.After its opening, it saves a lot of time to commute from Khairtabad to Secunderabad. It also is a hub for lot of family outings, one can find fun events along the park. On weekends, there are lot of activity options for families. Ample car parking space at multiple places on this road. One should be very careful and cautious after 10pm, as might find miscreants around since the road gets very isolated."

Itd quite a big place to walk and quite green too.\n\nOnly thing I feel is there are no benches close to water facing towards lake . It would have been a good thing for all visitors.\n\nSomehow they need to control dog entries inside park because dogs poops are everywhere and u need to be careful that u don't step on it.\n\nAlso entry fee 50 rupees is fine for one time visit but people who live close I think it would be good to have a pass option so that they can come often for walks or spend time . Daily 50 rupees is not a good option."

This particular one offers all that and more. The market presents every possible flower – from roses to daisies – imaginable up for sale, with some vendors carrying them for as far as 50 kilometres.",

The market is busiest in the early morning, so it's best to visit before sunrise for the freshest picks. Prices are reasonable, and the fragrance of fresh flowers fills the entire area. It can get crowded, especially during festivals, but the experience is worth it. A must-visit for florists, decorators, and flower enthusiasts!"

We recently visited for a potluck, and it turned out to be a fun experience. The park is neatly maintained, with a clean and well-kept landscape, making it a pleasant place to relax and enjoy nature. The parking area is convenient and reasonably priced at just ₹20 for cars.\n\nThe entry ticket is affordable too—₹10 for adults and ₹5 for kids—which makes it accessible for everyone. The park provides ample space for activities and gatherings, and it's a good venue for spending quality time outdoors.\n\nHowever, one downside is the crowd. It tends to get quite crowded, which can make it a bit overwhelming during peak hours. Additionally, the park is still under construction in some areas, but once completed, it is bound to become even more beautiful and well-organized.\n\nOverall, Deccan Park is a budget-friendly, enjoyable destination for families and friends. With its promising development, it’s worth visiting and keeping on your list for future outings!"

It's a beautifully maintained space that’s perfect for walking, jogging, or running, with wide and clean paths surrounded by greenery And also has spacious parking for 2 and 4 wheelers but applies ticket charges upto 20-40 rupees and the entry ticket is also affordable for rupees 10 adult and rupees 5 for kid and monthly pass is about 300 which is much more affordable if you visit regularly ( cash only accepted) .The environment is peaceful and refreshing great for starting or ending your day with some movement.\nThere’s also a well-equipped playground for kids and enough open space to enjoy outdoor sports like badminton or frisbee.It’s also a pet-friendly park, which makes it even more enjoyable for pet parents!\nOne important thing to note is that even as it's a picnic spot eatables are partially allowed but maintain cleanliness if in case you plan a potluck or picnic with family, this helps keep the park clean and focused on fitness and recreation. If you're looking for a calm, activity friendly environment, Deccan Park is absolutely worth visiting. I personally love spending time here🌿🐾💚"

Especially in the morning, the park offers a serene and refreshing atmosphere, with cool air, lush greenery, and the soft golden glow of the rising sun filtering through the dense canopy of trees.\n\nOne of the most breathtaking sights here is the presence of peacocks, gracefully wandering around or displaying their vibrant plumage. Their calls echo through the park, adding to the tranquil, almost mystical ambiance of the early hours.\n\nThe park is ideal for walkers, joggers, and runners, offering two main tracks:\n•\tInner Track: Approximately 4 km, winding through dense foliage and well-maintained paths, perfect for those who prefer a quieter, shaded walk close to nature.\n•\tOuter Track: Around 9 km, circling the park and offering a more open, spacious path with scenic views of the surrounding area.\n\nWhether you’re looking to start your day with a refreshing walk, breathe in fresh air, or simply enjoy the beauty of nature and wildlife, KBR Park is one of the best places in Hyderabad."

The statue itself is quite majestic and peaceful, especially when viewed up close—it’s impressive in size and beautifully sculpted. However, the overall experience could be much better.\n\nThe boat ride to the statue is often crowded and not very well organized. Waiting times can be long, and the boats themselves feel a bit run-down. The area around the statue also lacks proper maintenance and cleanliness, which takes away from the serenity you'd expect from such a monument."

The statue is situated on Gibraltar Rock, a concrete plinth erected in the middle of Hussain Sagar Lake, an artificial heart-shaped lake built in 1562.\n\nThe statue depicts the Buddha in the Abhaya Mudra—a gesture of peace and fearlessness .\n\nHistory & Significance:\nThe project was initiated by N. T. Rama Rao (NTR), inspired by the Statue of Liberty during his visit to New York. He envisioned a similar emblem of cultural pride for Hyderabad .\n\nThe granite was sourced from a mountainside near Raigiri in Bhuvanagiri, roughly 46 km from Hyderabad. Over 200 sculptors spent years crafting the statue beginning in 1985; it was finally completed and installed after overcoming a major mishap—during transport, the statue fell into the lake, resulting in tragic loss of life. It was salvaged and erected correctly on 1 December 1992 .\n\nIn 2006, the statue was consecrated by the Dalai Lama, further enhancing its spiritual significance ."

              "reviewText": "Buddha Statue, Hyderabad\nVisited on 19 July 2025 – The majestic Buddha statue standing tall in the middle of Hussain Sagar Lake is truly a breathtaking sight. Rising about 18 meters and carved from a single block of white granite, it is one of the largest monolithic Buddha statues in the world. The serene surroundings, gentle lake breeze, and peaceful aura made me feel calm and inspired. Being here felt like a perfect blend of history, art, and spirituality – a moment I’ll always remember."

The tour was unexpected but the staff saw that I was very interested in the articles being exhibited so they reached out and asked me if I would like a tour and of course I agreed. The museum was small and was in need of some TLC but it had some very interesting objects. What interested me the most we’re all the gifts that the local ruler received from both his subjects￼ and visiting dignitaries. They were so many objects made of both gold and silver I was truly amazed I had no idea that it such a small museum could hold so many precious objects."

The highlight of the museum is the gold tiffin box, which was stolen in 2018 along with other artifacts, but restored soon at its place. The place itself  gives you royal vibes about how opulent the erstwhile nizams were and how he was interested in keeping the gifts and artifacts safe during his regime. The impossible to believe fact is that the Nizam gave 2 tonnes of gold jewellery during the war time (see picture with the then prime minister of India Lalbahadur Shastri). Nizam VII was the modern architect of Hyderabad and built some magnificent Edifices."

Go for a complete package which Slightly bit costly but worthy and you will definitely enjoy all the places available in promises. The best time to visit is after 3:00 pm. Better to keep some hard cash if you want to eat Snacks or drink hot/cold drinks something you like. Online or Card payment will not be useful inside the Snow world area. Rest is very good. Sufficient parking is available for 2 and 4 wheel both. The quality/taste of food outside Snow world where you can sit and relax is also decent. No need to worry regarding warm clothes as they will be supplied inside the Snow world temporarily. Just wear it while entering and remove it while exiting from the cold area ."

It’s perfect for families, couples, and groups of friends looking to beat the heat and experience something different.\n\nHighlights:\n\nSnow Zone: The main attraction is the artificially created snow area where temperatures drop below zero. You can enjoy snow slides, snowball fights, and even dance in snowfall – all while dressed in warm jackets and boots provided at the venue.\n\nUpside Down Room: A quirky and fun photo spot, where the furniture and room settings are all inverted. Great for taking illusion-style pictures!\n\nTrick Art Museum: Creative 3D art installations where you can pose with lifelike paintings that create cool visual effects in photos.\n\nMirror Maze: A fun and confusing experience where you try to find your way out of a maze of mirrors.\n\nHaunted House: A mild scare attraction that’s more fun than frightening, good for a quick thrill.\n\nKid’s Play Area & Arcade Games: There are also sections with arcade-style games and small rides for kids.\n\nOverall Experience:\nIt’s an entertaining half-day outing, especially if you want to enjoy snow in a tropical city. Clean, well-maintained, and worth visiting once, especially with children or for couples who want playful photo opportunities.\n\nRating: 4/5\n\nBut visit on weekdays for less crowd"

Each session lasts around 1 hour, which honestly feels perfect according to the cold inside.\nThey provide you with all the essentials like a jacket, gloves, gum boots, and socks, so you're well covered for the freezing temperature.\n\nOne thing to note: if you want to take your mobile inside, there's a charge of ₹50 per device. Otherwise, you can deposit your phone at a separate counter for safekeeping."

Since this place is for kids, it is no fun when they cant touch or experience what they are seeing. Plain watching does not make them happy. Only a few cars have been placed outside where people can sit and click photos. Inside the 3 halls, its just watch from a distance and keep walking\n\n2. General upkeep of the place. Its dusty.\n\n3. Absence of clean washrooms and eating place.\n\nIf the museum keep aside a few cars of different shapes which children can take rides in, that would be awesome. The cars created by Mr. Sudhakar are amazing. The fact that they all are working cars, fitted with engines and wheels make them interesting but its just watch and walk kind of museum which can be finished in mere 30 minutes at max."

The ticket system itself feels like some kind of joke: ₹150 for adults and ₹120 for kids for a visit that barely lasts 10 minutes. On top of that, they shamelessly charge ₹100 extra just for clicking photos on your own mobile camera. No digital payment option, no proper billing, and to make it worse, they don’t even keep change to return your balance. You literally end up paying more because of their poor management.\nAs for what’s inside—someone with a very weird imagination has just taken random ideas, built cars shaped like fruits, vegetables, and household junk, slapped on an engine and tyres, and called it “creativity.” That’s it. Nothing more.\nParking? Space for maybe 10 cars max—again, not thoughtful at all.\nIf you’re a car enthusiast or petrolhead, prepare to be utterly disappointed. There’s nothing about real cars, innovation, or automobile history here. At best, kids might find it amusing for a few minutes, but honestly, with these ridiculous ticket rates and pointless photo charges, it’s absolutely not worth it.\nOverall, frustrating, overpriced, and a total waste of time. Not recommended to anyone."

              "reviewText": "I visited this park with a friend, and overall, it was a mixed experience. The ticket prices were Rs. 40 for garden entry and Rs. 70 to see the deer. However, since there were only two of us around 3:30 to 4:00 PM, we weren’t allowed to take the van ride to the deer enclosure, likely because they wait for a full van. This was disappointing, especially for visitors who travel from far or are from outside Nagrabah.\n\nStill, by God’s grace, we did get to see a few deer from a distance. The garden itself is quite peaceful and well-maintained. It’s clean, green, and offers a good place to relax. However, the butterfly park was underwhelming—we didn’t see a single butterfly.\n\nI also felt that the park could benefit from having more professional staff, including security and internal services. That said, my visit was on a weekday, so it's possible that there were fewer staff on duty compared to weekends.\n\nThe park is large—possibly spread across hundreds of acres—and has a lot of potential. It’s a beautiful place within the city limits, and with more development and better management, it could become a major attraction.\n\nAfter visiting the park, we also went to Ramojii Theme City and Sanghi Temple, which are nearby and worth checking out.\n\nRating: 3 out of 5 — Average experience, but the place is beautiful and full of potential.\n\nMessage to the authorities: This park has great natural value and deserves more attention and development from the government."

              "reviewText": "Mrugavani National Park, located near Chilkur in Hyderabad, is a hidden gem for nature enthusiasts seeking a tranquil escape from the city. Spanning about 3.6 square kilometers, it’s an ideal spot to explore Telangana’s native flora and fauna. Here are my thoughts after visiting:\n\nPros:\n1. Serene Atmosphere: The park offers a refreshing break with its lush greenery, making it a perfect spot for a day out. It’s less crowded compared to other parks in Hyderabad, which adds to its peaceful charm.\n2. Wildlife Sightings: While exploring, you might encounter deer, peacocks, and a variety of birds. For bird watchers, it's a treat with several species like kingfishers and eagles being commonly spotted.\n3. Guided Safari: The park offers a short safari ride that takes you deeper into the forest. It’s a fun experience for families, especially with kids who enjoy spotting animals in their natural habitat.\n4. Watchtower and Nature Trails: The watchtower offers a panoramic view of the dense forest, while the nature trails are perfect for a light trek amidst nature. It’s a great place for photography enthusiasts.\n5. Proximity to Chilkur Balaji Temple: If you're planning a full day trip, you can combine a visit to the famous Chilkur Balaji Temple, which is just a few minutes away.\n\nCons:\n1. Limited Facilities: The park is relatively underdeveloped compared to other national parks. Facilities like restrooms and refreshment options are minimal, so it's advisable to carry your own snacks and water.\n2. Short Safari Duration: The safari ride is quite brief, lasting only around 15-20 minutes. Those expecting a longer wildlife experience might be slightly disappointed.\n3. Timing Restrictions: The park has specific visiting hours (typically 9 AM to 5 PM), so plan your visit accordingly to avoid being turned away.\n\nConclusion: Mrugavani National Park is a great destination for those who enjoy nature and wildlife in a serene, uncrowded setting. It may not have all the bells and whistles of larger national parks, but its natural beauty and tranquility make it worth a visit, especially if you're in Hyderabad looking for a short and peaceful getaway."

              "reviewText": "Mrugavani National Park: Hyderabad’s Best-Kept Secret (Because It Should Stay That Way)\n\nIf you’ve ever wondered what happens when a \"national park\" and a government-run disappointment have a lovechild, look no further than Mrugavani National Park—Hyderabad’s most efficiently forgettable attraction.\n\nThe \"Wild\" Experience (Or Lack Thereof)\nFor a mere ₹40, you gain entry to what can only be described as a slightly  ambitious municipal garden with an identity crisis. The entire \"park\" can be explored in less time than it takes to argue with an auto-rickshaw driver—making the journey here feel like an elaborate prank.\n\nThe much-touted \"safari\" (₹800) is an open-top joyride through… well, mostly dirt and the occasional deer. The staff will helpfully inform you that the bus option (which would at least be cheaper) is mysteriously not running, leaving you no choice but the overpriced mobile oven they call a safari vehicle. If you’re expecting lions, tigers, or even a mildly interesting peacock, prepare for crushing disillusionment. For a far better wildlife experience, Nehru Zoo offers thrills at a fraction of the price—unless, of course, your idea of adventure is watching deer yawn in captivity.\n\nThe \"Scenic\" Viewpoint (Now with Bonus PDA!)\nEager for a breathtaking panorama of Hyderabad? Too bad. The viewpoint—which logically should be the park’s saving grace—is inexplicably blocked off. But fear not! With some determination ), you can reach the top… only to be greeted by Hyderabad’s most amorous couples in what can only be described as nature’s own romance theatre. If you’ve ever wanted to feel like an accidental extra in a low-budget romantic drama, this is your chance.\n\nThe \"Information\" Centre (A Study in Irony)\nIn a bold architectural statement, the park features an Information Centre—complete with both an entry and exit gate, a truly ambitious design for what is essentially a glorified storage closet. When I visited, it was closed (naturally), leaving me with more questions than answers. What secrets lie within? A single outdated brochure? A disinterested clerk? The world may never know.\n\nFinal Verdict: A Masterclass in Lowered Expectations\n- Wildlife?More like mild-life.\n- Romantic ambience? Only if you’re part of a couple (and even then, Nehru Zoo has better benches).\n- Adventure? Unless you count avoiding unmaintained toilets, not really.\n\nRating: ★☆☆☆☆ (1 star—because \"zero\" would imply effort was made.)\nWho Should Visit?\n- Couples looking for privacy.\n- People who enjoy paying to see less than what a city zoo offers.\n- Masochists who think *\"government-run eco-tourism\"* sounds like a good idea.\n\nPro Tip:Save your ₹money, buy a plant for your balcony and name it \"Mrugavani.\" It’ll be far more exciting.\n\nHappy (not) exploring!"
