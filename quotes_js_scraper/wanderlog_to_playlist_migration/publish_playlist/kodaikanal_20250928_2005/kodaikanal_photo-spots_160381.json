The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking – a stunning panorama of the valleys and cliffs.\n\nHowever, it was extremely crowded during my visit, and I had to wait around 10 minutes in a queue just to get to the viewpoint. That said, the path leading up is lined with small shops selling souvenirs and gift items at very reasonable prices – much cheaper than other tourist spots.\n\nOverall, despite the crowd, it's worth the wait for the fantastic view and a bit of budget shopping along the way!",
