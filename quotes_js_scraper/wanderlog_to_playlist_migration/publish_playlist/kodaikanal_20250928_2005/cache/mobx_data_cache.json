You'd reach at the top of the waterfall, a place no one ever goes to. If you are up to some adventure, that is the place you wanna go to. Explore further into through the stream and you'll never forget the place. I've attached few pics of it."

Water fall is almost 15 min walk away from road, can park your vehicle on the side and walk into. Nice view, good water, walk way can be maintained well. Take care while walk over the rock, might be slipping. Lot of trees, soothing wind, little adventurous. The authorities can pay little more attention to such nice places and attract more tourists to these kind of places."

The caves are closed with fencing, but the surrounding pine forest and the twisted roots of old trees look truly magical. Walking among them feels like stepping into a fantasy movie. No entry ticket needed, and it’s a great place for photos and peaceful vibes. 🌲✨"

You cannot go to the Caves for obvious reasons, but the tree roots are something that you can use to shoot some great photos. Have some nice photogenic places on the way to the caves so try shooting some great pictures.\n\nFee: As of July 2025, the entry is Rs. 10 for adults and free for kids below age 5. Best to visit along with the other places like Pine Forest, Moir Point and Pillar Rock."

The cave is not visible through the closed gate because its viability has been lost due to forest leaves and grasses. However, it provides a breathtaking view of the mountain ranges.The film Manjummel Boys has greatly increased the popularity of this location. The location is absolutely stunning. I would recommend going on weekdays to fully enjoy the experience without the crowds. Aside from the traffic, the weather made the trip more enjoyable.Many sections of the cave are now closed due to safety concerns; the caves are extremely deep and dangerous, and steel gates have been installed to prevent accidents.This is a popular tourist destination, offering breathtaking views of foggy trees and rock formations. However, be prepared for crowds, particularly on weekends. Parking can be difficult, so plan accordingly. Despite the crowds, the natural beauty and scenic views are worth the trip. Take a moment to appreciate the unique rocks and the breathtaking views.  One of the highlights is a unique spot where the tree roots are curled and twisted like a web, which is great for taking photos and videos 📸✨. Be cautious of monkeys; they will steal your purse or phone!"

It holds historical charm and eerie beauty.\n\nDue to safety concerns, cave access is now restricted with gates, as the crevices are dangerously deep.

The views of the lake and surrounding pine trees are absolutely stunning.\n\n🐎 Horse riding is available and highly recommended—the hilly terrain makes the experience even more enjoyable. It costs ₹200 per person, and the staff will take photos and videos using your own phone."

Walking through this forest feels like stepping into a peaceful😌, natural world 🌳 — truly an awesome experience. Horse 🐴 riding is also available, adding to the fun & adventure.\n\nA board at the entrance shares the history: “The Pine Forests came into existence due to the efforts of Mr. Bryant, a British Forest Officer, who raised 15 varieties of pine plantations between 1905 to 1915. The sight of abundant pine trees, appearing grey with dried cones & leaves 🍂, is truly a wonder of nature.”\n\nIt’s best to visit during summer ☀️weekdays to avoid the heavy crowds. The entry fee is ₹10 per person 💸. Outside the forest, many small shops offer snacks & refreshments 🍕🥤.\n\nPlease help preserve the natural beauty by avoiding littering 🚫. Use the dustbins 🗑️🚮 provided to dispose of any plastic🛍️ or paper waste & help keep the forest clean & green 🌍."

The view from the top is absolutely breathtaking – a stunning panorama of the valleys and cliffs.\n\nHowever, it was extremely crowded during my visit, and I had to wait around 10 minutes in a queue just to get to the viewpoint. That said, the path leading up is lined with small shops selling souvenirs and gift items at very reasonable prices – much cheaper than other tourist spots.\n\nOverall, despite the crowd, it’s worth the wait for the fantastic view and a bit of budget shopping along the way!"

While it's not luxury, the natural beauty coupled with photo ops and local charm make it worth a stop. Ideal for quick visits or as part of a scenic loop with nearby attractions.\n\nBeautiful viewpoint offering stunning panoramic views of lush valleys and the distant Vaigai Dam. The area is peaceful, with fresh air and great photo opportunities—especially on clear days. There are local stalls selling homemade chocolates, spices, and souvenirs on the way in. Can get foggy in the mornings and crowded during peak season. Beware of monkeys near the railings!\n\n🕒 Best time to visit: 10 AM to 3 PM\n💡 Tip: Visit on a clear day for the best views."

The valley stretches as far as the eye can see, with mist-kissed mountains in the distance. The view is especially mesmerizing during sunrise and sunset, when the sky transforms into a canvas of colors.\n\nGreen Valley View Point is also a photographer's dream. The play of light and shadow, along with the ever-changing weather, creates a myriad of photographic opportunities. Whether you're an amateur or a professional, you'll leave with stunning shots to cherish.\n\nA word of caution, though: the road leading to the viewpoint can be quite narrow and winding, so be prepared for a slightly challenging drive. Additionally, during peak tourist seasons, it can get crowded, so plan your visit accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, Green Valley View Point is a slice of paradise for those seeking serenity and natural beauty. It's an ideal destination to unwind, reconnect with nature, and capture unforgettable moments. Don't forget to bring your camera and a sense of wonder when you visit this hidden gem."

              "reviewText": "Silver Cascade Falls, Kodaikanal – A Beautiful Natural Stop, But Needs Care\n\nSilver Cascade Falls is the first scenic welcome point as you approach the beautiful hill town of Kodaikanal, located just before entering the main city. Flowing directly from the mountain, this is a natural waterfall that gives a refreshing preview of the beauty that lies ahead in the hills.\n\n🌊 Nature & Scenery:\n\nThe waterfall is a majestic sight, especially after rains or during the monsoon season, when the water flow is strong and the surroundings are lush green. Water cascades down from a good height, creating a cool mist and a calming atmosphere. It’s one of those picture-perfect spots where most tourists stop for a quick photo or to admire nature’s beauty.\n\nThe sound of the waterfall, fresh mountain air, and scenic backdrop make it a great spot for short halts, family photos, or a few moments of peace before entering the hill station.\n\n🐒 Monkeys & Environment:\n\nOne thing visitors should be aware of is the presence of many monkeys in the area. While they usually mind their own business, it’s important to be careful, especially if you’re carrying food or small bags.\n\n🛣️ Accessibility & Location:\n•\tLocated right beside the main road leading up to Kodaikanal, the falls are easily accessible by car or bus.\n•\tNo trekking is needed — which makes it convenient for all age groups.\n•\tHowever, because it’s on a roadside bend, parking can be limited and sometimes unsafe, especially during weekends and holidays.\n\n🛍️ Local Vendors – Be Cautious:\n\nThere are a number of small vendors and stalls selling snacks, fruits, corn, tea, and souvenirs. While it’s nice to see local business, it’s important to be careful with pricing.\n•\tMany vendors quote 2–3 times the normal price for items.\n•\tTourists are advised to check the prices beforehand and bargain politely before buying anything.\n\n🧹 Maintenance & Cleanliness:\n\nThis is one area that needs attention. Though the natural beauty is undeniable, the lack of proper maintenance is disappointing.\n•\tYou’ll often see litter around the viewing spots and unclean pathways.\n•\tThe fencing, signboards, and safety measures are either missing or poorly maintained.\n•\tGiven how popular this place is among travelers, it definitely deserves better care by local authorities.\n\n📸 Final Thoughts – A Worthwhile Stop:\n\nDespite the maintenance issues and overpriced vendors, Silver Cascade Falls is a must-stop location for anyone traveling to Kodaikanal. The natural beauty, accessibility, and the charm of a roadside waterfall make it a memorable part of the journey.\n\nIt’s one of those places where you can pause your travel, stretch your legs, enjoy a cup of chai, click some great photos, and soak in the mountain vibes.\n\n⸻\n\n✅ Tips for Visitors:\n•\tStop for a short break and photos.\n•\tBe careful of monkeys — avoid showing food.\n•\tBargain with vendors and confirm prices before buying.\n•\tDon’t litter — help keep the place clean.\n•\tVisit during or after rains for the best water flow.\n\n⸻\n\nWith a little more attention from authorities and cooperation from visitors, Silver Cascade Falls can shine as a well-loved natural gem of Kodaikanal."

The falls are tall and beautiful, especially during or just after the monsoon when the water flow is strong, making it a great spot for photography and a quick break.\n\nSince it is roadside, the place is very accessible, and there are small shops nearby selling snacks, tea, and souvenirs. However, it can get very crowded with tourists, and sometimes the water isn’t very clean during the dry season. It’s more of a viewing spot than a place to spend a lot of time, as there are no facilities for bathing or trekking here.\n\nOverall, Silver Cascade Falls is worth a short stop for its natural beauty and to capture some good pictures, but not a destination to spend long hours. The best time to visit is during or after the rains when the waterfall is at its most impressive.\n\nRating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)"

We went by afternoon 12 PM and to our luck, the skies were clear and we were able to observe the sun through 3 different telescopes. The guide person explains everything very clearly and are very knowledgeable adults. Never seen such guides in any musuem!! Kudos!!\n\nThe Musuem is almost around 500m from the entrance which needs a steep walk so could be harder for older people.\n\nFees: Entry Rs. 50 per person for Adults and free for kids under 12. Can visit from Morning 9 to evening 4 PM. But, it is best to visit by 10 AM - 2 PM when the sun is at top."

Neatly maintained but some repair works going on here and there. Scenic view of the Kodai valley and town. Mostly surrounded by clouds blocking the view. On a clear day we can even see the Dolphin Nose viewpoint and clear view of Palani hills as well. Many snacks, clothes, handicrafts and toy shops along with other entertainments available along side the walk path. Parking is available but limited places.

              "reviewText": "Dolphin's Nose in Kodaikanal offers a rewarding experience, though it requires a trek to reach the location. Early mornings are often recommended, but even visiting around 10:00 AM can be fine due to the prevalent fog. Be prepared for a downhill trek on the way to the point and a more tiring uphill trek on the return journey, which typically takes about 30-35 minutes. The view at Dolphin's Nose is truly breathtaking, showcasing the beauty of nature. The name comes from a nose-shaped rock formation, but there are other similar rocks, so caution is advised when standing on them due to the steep drop beneath, as there are no safety provisions. Unfortunately, the trail is marred by a noticeable amount of plastic litter, a result of some tourists' lack of environmental responsibility."

It requires a 30–40 min trek — steep downhill to reach, and a tiring uphill return. Early mornings or weekdays are best to avoid crowds and enjoy the misty beauty.\n\nThere are no safety rails, so be cautious near the edge. While the view is worth it for most, some feel it’s a bit overhyped. Good shoes and stamina are a must.\n\nBe mindful of litter on the trail, and help keep it clean. A rewarding visit for those who love a bit of adventure and scenic landscapes!"

From the moment I entered, I was struck by its incredible beauty and lush greenery. The meticulously maintained lawns and vibrant trees created such a picturesque setting that I honestly felt transported to a charming European country. It's rare to find such a peaceful and aesthetically pleasing place that offers such a delightful escape from urban hustle.\nBeyond its stunning appearance, the park is remarkably neat and clean, which significantly adds to its appeal. Even the washroom facilities were impeccably maintained, which is always a welcome sign and speaks volumes about the care taken in the park's upkeep.\nBryant Park is a must-visit for anyone seeking a serene and beautiful environment. It's a perfect spot for a leisurely stroll, a quiet read, or simply to soak in the peaceful atmosphere. I can't recommend it enough!"

It had some nice greenery but overall it lacked  standout features. While it was a relaxing place to walk around, it didn’t leave a lasting impression. . Lot to be developed to actually convert this place as an attraction...the only impressive part was the weather which had a out of the world experience particularly walking alongside clouds.A decent spot for a short visit, but not something I’d go out of my way to see again."

While it's certainly not a place for swimming due to its size, the gentle sound of the water provides a moment of calm. However, the unfortunately noticeable amount of garbage flowing downstream significantly detracts from the experience. It's a shame, as with better maintenance and attention to cleanliness by the authorities, this could easily be a more appealing spot. As it stands, it's an okay place to briefly pause, but falls short of being truly enjoyable due to the litter. A solid three-star experience, with potential for improvement."

The sound of the waterfall and the fresh morning air made it a refreshing stop. A great spot to enjoy nature if you go early—later in the day, it tends to get very crowded and noisy. Highly recommend visiting in the early hours for the best experience."

I remember walking quite a distance in the view point.. now the space is very small.. you can just stand and see.. you cannot walk and all... And you might find better views else where.. this place was not worth the hype...\n\nThe traffic was aligned in such a way this point was the first one then we move towards moira point and gina cave and pine forest... It s one way.. there was no place to have lunch ... So plan your food ....\n\nThere was a small shop near the green valley point called Kerala restaurant.... Oh my .... Absolutely garbage.. don't even go there..."

Have a walk with the shops on both the sides to reach the view point. Beware of monkeys, which will be on the run to grab the food items from you. View point is really and worth to watch it after a walk. In the view point, you can find govt authorised chocolate shop, where will be assorted home made chocolates for 100 per 250 gm. Other shops rates are higher and they will say quality 1, 2 and 3. I feel this shop is better in terms quality, quantity and price. May be you can check and decide, but overall nice place to visit and sight seeing as well"

While it's certainly not a place for swimming due to its size, the gentle sound of the water provides a moment of calm. However, the unfortunately noticeable amount of garbage flowing downstream significantly detracts from the experience. It's a shame, as with better maintenance and attention to cleanliness by the authorities, this could easily be a more appealing spot. As it stands, it's an okay place to briefly pause, but falls short of being truly enjoyable due to the litter. A solid three-star experience, with potential for improvement."

There is only 1 telescope so there will be a bit of waiting for that. There isn't much you can view with a telescope as it has limited movements. But the binoculars can get you good views. You have limited place to stand outside and not recommended if its crowded.\n\nThere are two such telescope houses in coakers walk so if one is crowded you can try the other one.

You can rent a cycle for ₹150 or ₹100, depending on the type.\n\nBoating is another highlight, with options like rowboats and pedal boats available for visitors. The cool climate and scenic surroundings make it a great spot to relax and enjoy nature.\n\nHowever, the cleanliness of the lake and its surroundings is not up to the mark. Littering and maintenance issues can be noticed, which slightly affects the overall experience. Despite this, Kodaikanal Lake is still a worthwhile visit for those looking to enjoy cycling, boating, and the pleasant weather.\n\nHowever, the place tends to get extremely crowded on weekends, which might make it difficult to fully enjoy the peaceful ambiance."
