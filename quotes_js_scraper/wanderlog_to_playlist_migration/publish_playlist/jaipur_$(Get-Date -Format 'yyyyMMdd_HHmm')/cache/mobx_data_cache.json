Built in 1799, this beautiful five-story palace made of red and pink sandstone is known for its 953 small windows, called jharokhas, designed to let cool air flow through the building.\n\nThe front of Hawa Mahal looks like a honeycomb or crown and is especially beautiful in the early morning light. Many people love taking photos from across the street, where several rooftop cafés offer the best views. From there, you can capture the full front of the palace—but please note, most cafés only allow photography if you buy something, like a cup of coffee or a snack. It’s a small price for a great experience and view.\n\nHawa Mahal was originally built so royal women could watch street life and festivals without being seen. Today, you can go inside and walk up the narrow ramps to enjoy beautiful views of the old city and nearby landmarks like Jantar Mantar.\n\nInside the palace, there are breezy passages, quiet courtyards, and a small museum. It doesn’t take much time to visit, but it’s full of charm and history.\n\nPlease also remember not to write or scratch on the walls. It’s a historic site, and we should help protect its beauty.\n\nHawa Mahal is a must-see in Jaipur—perfect for photography, culture, and a quick coffee with a royal view."

But if you really want to see it at its best, I recommend visiting after evening. When the lights turn on, Hawa Mahal looks even more stunning and magical. The whole place lights up and feels much more lively. Daytime visit is nice, but the evening view is definitely more special."

The intricate latticework and honeycomb design are unlike anything else, and the breeze that flows through its 953 windows truly lives up to its name—the \"Palace of Winds.\"\n\nClimbing up through the narrow passages gives you a unique perspective of royal life, and the view from the top over the bustling streets of Jaipur is spectacular. The on-site museum also offers great insight into the heritage of the palace.\n\nA must-visit when in Jaipur—iconic, photogenic, and steeped in history. Five stars without a doubt!!"

The fort is easily reachable by bike with a smooth road and a short ride through scenic hills. The views from the top are just stunning especially during sunset when you can see the whole city of Jaipur. The fort itself has beautiful old architecture and a peaceful vibe. There are a few cafes inside to relax and enjoy snacks. The area is clean and well maintained"

The fort is open from 9:00 AM to 9:30 PM, giving you plenty of time to explore at your own pace.\n\nWe booked our own bike to get there — cost about ₹50 for parking, which is also fair considering the location and security.\n\nThe views from the top are absolutely stunning, especially during sunset. The fort itself is well-maintained and offers a mix of history, architecture, and panoramic city views. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Jaipur!\n\nWould recommend bringing water and wearing comfortable shoes, especially if you plan to walk around a lot. Overall, a memorable and budget-friendly experience. 👍"

But you have at least 2-3 hours or more to spend here to enjoy everything. Nice journey thnx all."

The day view is breathtaking, but the night view with sparkling city lights is simply unforgettable.\nThe place does get hot during the day, so the best time to visit is from mid-August to February.\n\nA small tip: you’ll find monkeys around in the evening. Avoid carrying water bottles in your hand or teasing them – I had one snatch mine! Bring some extra water for them instead.\n\nOverall, an amazing spot for photography and one of the best city views I’ve ever seen. Highly recommend!"

The architecture is stunning — a grand, beautifully detailed building that stands out in the heart of Jaipur. Inside, the museum is full of ancient treasures: intricate stone carvings, traditional paintings, royal weapons, textiles, coins, and many fascinating items once used by kings. It’s like stepping back in time. Everything is well-organized and informative. Even though I visited in the daytime, the museum was still full of charm and elegance. Highly recommend spending 1–2 hours here if you’re in Jaipur!"

Although there were a few areas under construction, the overall ambiance was impressive.\n\nHowever, one thing that bothered me was the ticket pricing. The charges are quite high, with separate fees for different sections and museums inside the palace, which can be frustrating. Considering it’s a historical site, it would be great if the ticket prices were kept more affordable so everyone can appreciate and learn from this heritage."

The temple was established in 18th century by Maharaja Jai Singh II, the founder of Jaipur, who brought the deities from Vrindavan. The temple's Satsang Hall holds the Guinness World Record for being the world's widest concrete building. The 15,800 square feet pillarless hall can accommodate 5,000 devotees at any given time. Visitors especially enjoy the early morning mangal aarti and evening prayers, which create a peaceful, devotional atmosphere. The temple’s blend of Mughal and Rajput architecture, along with its well-maintained gardens, adds to its charm. Despite the daily crowds, the temple remains clean and well-managed. Close to popular Jaipur attractions, it’s an ideal spot for both devotees and tourists looking for a tranquil experience steeped in culture and faith. It was a beautiful, soulful visit — full of joy, devotion, and gratitude. We truly felt blessed and pray that Govind Dev Ji continues to watch over us always."

Often overlooked for more commercial hill stations, Jawhar is a serene, culturally rich destination tucked away in the Palghar district of Maharashtra, just a few hours’ drive from Mumbai or Nashik.\n\nWhat immediately strikes you about Jawhar is its unspoiled natural beauty. Surrounded by rolling hills, dense forests, and cascading waterfalls, the landscape feels untouched and peaceful. The drive itself is scenic, especially during the monsoon, when the greenery is at its peak and the weather is pleasantly cool.\n\nOne of the highlights was our visit to Dabhosa Waterfall, one of the highest waterfalls in Maharashtra. The sight and sound of the water plunging into the valley below was both thrilling and calming. The Jai Vilas Palace, built in a fusion of tribal and European styles, offers a peek into the royal heritage of the region and is set against a beautiful hilly backdrop.\n\nJawhar is also rich in tribal culture, especially that of the Warli tribe, known for their iconic Warli art. We were lucky to interact with some local artisans and witness them create intricate pieces—something truly memorable and unique to the region.\n\nDespite being a smaller town, we found clean, comfortable homestays and eco-resorts, along with simple yet hearty Maharashtrian food served with warmth. The locals are welcoming and always ready to share stories about their town, making the experience all the more authentic.\n\nWhether you’re looking to unwind in nature, explore offbeat trails, or experience tribal culture up close, Jawhar offers all of this without the touristy chaos. It’s peaceful, picturesque, and has a distinct charm of its own.\n\nWe left Jawhar feeling refreshed, inspired, and already planning a return trip. Highly recommended for those looking for a soulful and scenic escape!"

This time my friend forced me into it, watched Malik here, the theater is all upgraded in sound and video quality. Loved the traditional sitting arrangement of Dress Circle, Balcony, and Box. The price is on the costlier side, but maybe it is because it is more of a tourist destination than a cinema. They have a locker (cloakroom) facility, which is very helpful for people who are there for shopping."

The courtyards are stunning and the grounds are very clean. Cool tunnels to go up and lookout, and tunnels that lead to other forts (which are prohibited). We took the elephant ride up to the top, which was not the most comfortable ride but I feel like one has to do it. What’s really annoying, and unenjoyable is the constant hawkers. They start when you arrive, while you get on the elephant, and the ENTIRE trip up to the top-not taking NO for an answer!  Once at the top, we tipped our mahout and apparently that was not good enough for him-even tho a big sign said “no tipping”.  Stay away and say no to the photographers, they hounded us from the exit all the way to our car and even in our car!! We even had one show up the the restaurant when we walked out-simply RIDICULOUS!  All in all, the fort is beautiful and spacious and clean, it was the extraneous bits that were extremely annoying!"

The elephant ride is a part of the charm for sure and they are beautifully decorated. The hawkers are plentiful and super aggressive but if you don’t make eye contact they do leave you alone. We saw a few others engage in angry conversations so unless you have intent to buy, I’d suggest not looking or speaking to them. There are 120 working elephants here and it seemed like most of the visitors used them to climb to the fort. I think you can walk up but I’m not sure. Even on the way up the hawkers are shouting at you and part way there are a ton of photographers trying to get you to pose so they can harass you at the top to buy. The elephant drivers start reminding you to tip as soon as you enter the courtyard and just a few rupees will suffice. The complex is huge and we would recommend a guide to understand what you are seeing. The section of mirrored walls is spectacular and there are many spots throughout the complex where amazing pictures can be taken. Our guide also suggested we peek into the keyholes of a few sections that were closed off and we did see some amazing things in these areas not currently open.  Lots to see here and I’m sure the 1.5 hours we spent just scratched the surface. Student charges is just 10 INR."

The symmetrical steps and geometric design are truly fascinating — it's a great spot for photography and soaking in some quiet history. It's not as crowded as other tourist sites, which makes the experience even more peaceful.\n\nSome interesting stories about its historical use for water conservation and as a community gathering spot, especially for women in earlier times. You can't go down the steps anymore (as per current rules), but even from the top, the view is stunning.\n\nIn front of the kund, there’s an ancient temple that adds to the charm and spiritual feel of the place. It’s a small but beautifully carved temple, and visiting it makes the whole experience even more special. The peaceful atmosphere around both the stepwell and the temple gives a glimpse into the cultural and architectural richness of Rajasthan.\n\nIf you're in Jaipur, definitely make time for this — it's just a short drive from the Amer Fort!"

It’s perfect for a family or couple outing, especially on weekdays. But if you're after the widest possible brand selection or ultra-budget eats, you might find better options elsewhere. Still, WTP’s ambiance, cinema, kids' zone, and architectural flair make it well worth a visit."

I frequently go there for movies and shopping, and every visit is a smooth and enjoyable experience. The mall is huge, beautifully designed, and very well-maintained – giving it a luxurious and modern feel that matches international standards.\n\nThe shopping options here are excellent. From premium fashion brands to electronics, beauty, and lifestyle stores – WTP has something for everyone. Whether I’m shopping for clothes, gadgets, or just window-shopping, it’s always fun and satisfying.\n\nOne of the main reasons I visit WTP regularly is for the movie experience. The multiplex is clean, well-managed, and the sound and picture quality are amazing. The seats are very comfortable, and the environment is peaceful – a great place to enjoy a movie without any hassle.\n\nThe food court is another big highlight. It offers a wide variety of food options – from well-known chains like Burger King, Domino’s, and KFC to local Indian flavors. There’s also a rooftop dining area that gives a beautiful view, especially in the evening.\n\nThe ambience is always lively yet calm, perfect for relaxing or spending time with friends and family. Even if I don’t plan on shopping, I enjoy just walking around, enjoying the vibe, and maybe grabbing a coffee or snack.\n\nParking is spacious, and the staff is always polite and helpful. Cleanliness and security are also well-maintained.\n\nOverall, World Trade Park is not just a shopping mall – it’s a complete lifestyle destination in Jaipur. Whether you’re a local or a tourist, this place is definitely worth a visit!"

In good shape and al lot of little sections to explore from community meeting areas to mirror rooms that are strategically designed to create illusions of location, to semi private screened open area window that gave women privacy, but also allowed the breezes to blow through and reduce the heat!\nYou will see a long wall area as well that rolls through the hills, not as long as Kumbhalghar but still significant nonetheless.\nAlso don't skip the hidden gem of the step well, as you could easily pass by it without realizing!\nDefinitely arrange for a guide to help walk you through all the history of the palace fort and the mogul influence and rule in Rajasthan."

Guides are not very expensive (up to ₹400) and make the trip more informative and are well-versed in almost all the languages of the world. The entry fee was about ₹600 for two adults and two children. It involves a lot of walking. That's both fitness and knowledge in a single place! There are many good places to take photos. Overall it’s a good experience and should be considered a must-visit. Very informative. There’s also a demonstration of how people did cloth and wall paintings in the olden days. A lot of foreign tourists can be seen around.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Taxis can go up to the fort entrance and one need not walk the whole path from the base of the mountain. ⛰️ altogether a nice place 👍👍"

The fort's stunning architecture, intricate carvings, and breathtaking views of the surrounding hills made it one of the highlights of my trip to Jaipur. The historical richness and majestic design truly showcase the grandeur of Rajasthan’s royal heritage.\n\nI highly recommend hiring a guide during your visit. The guide shared fascinating stories, historical facts, and cultural insights that added so much depth to the experience. It really helped me appreciate the significance of each area within the fort, from the beautiful Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace) to the sprawling courtyards.The entire atmosphere was magical, especially during the early morning hours when the fort is quieter and the light is perfect for photos. Whether you're interested in history, architecture, or just enjoying scenic beauty, Amber Fort has something for everyone.\n\nI am fully satisfied with the visit and would definitely recommend it to others. Don’t miss it if you're in Jaipur!"

The town itself bears witness to the tremendous splendour that pervades the area. However, Jaipur is lovely because of its name and the numerous structures and monuments that add to its' regal aura.\nMonumental Gates have been a reflection of a kingdom's prosperity. Rulers have always desired to construct massive gates that would play an essential part in protecting the countrymen while also displaying the state's strength. Many gates not only depicted military purposes but also expressed joy, honour, and goodwill. Thus, gates have remained an integral part of the country's architecture. All of these magnificent gates have an outstanding legacy and history.\nAnd one of them is the Ridhi Sidhi Pol.\nIt is a doorway within the City Palace in Jaipur, and it is one of several exquisite constructions within its borders. The City Palace complex comprises courtyards, extensive gardens, and buildings. The Chandra Mahal, Mubarak Mahal, Badal Mahal, and Shri Govind Devji Temple are the principal attractions inside the complex. The palace complex includes Mubarak Mahal, often known as the 'palace of welcome' or 'reception.' It used to be a welcome centre where visitors came to meet the Maharaja. Maharaja Madho Singh II constructed it in the late 1800s.\nCurrently, this historical museum houses an extensive collection of royal costumes, elegant and valuable Pashmina shawls, Banarasi Silk Saris, Sanganeri prints, and folk embroidery.\nThis section of the city palace complex takes its name after the image of Lord Ganesha and his wives- Ridhi and Sidhi. They are among the best instances of the Rajputs' attention to detail in all aspects, which are now a strong custom amongst the region's people.\nPreviously, such palaces were home to the royal Rajputs. The grandeur and architecture of this location are a surprise for the visitors. The design and making of this place leave everybody in awe.\nThe beauty of the location is well-known because of its aesthetically laid out courtyards, gardens, and buildings. This magnificent palace is a living testament to the architectural brilliance and creative splendour of previous generations. City Palace, which describes Mughal and Rajput style designs, is a haven for many beautiful creations that add to the royal grace.\nThe Ridhi Sidhi Pol is easily accessible because it is located in the heart of the city. It also offers a variety of nearby attractions such as the Hawa Mahal, Amber Fort, Nahargarh Fort, and Jaigarh Fort. Moreover, Ridhi Sidhi Pol is an enticing and picturesque structure located within Jaipur's City Palace.\n\n∆ Ridhi Sidhi Pol Jaipur Entry Fee\n• 75 per person for Indians\n• 300 per person for Foreign Tourists"

The Ticket Price for Sheesh Mahal is ₹500 .Jaipur's Sheesh Mahal has stood testament to the changing time and evolving cityscape that is today a reflection of the beauty and grandeur of the royals of Rajasthan. Mirror-work has long played a significant role in all types of decor, and Rajasthan takes the credit for introducing the world to novel ways of utilising mirrors."

The cab drivers will tell you that it's the best thing because they earn commission on each tourist they send in the mahal. It's not a mahal, it's a room with small colorful pieces of mirrors in it. Not at all interesting. The wax figures also are very dull and not good to look at. They do not allow any camera inside this private museum. Btw it's not even a museum, it's a small alley with wax figures, some photos and then a small room called sheesh mahal. That's all."

Its walls and pillars contain small mirrors which reflects the lights and sun rays plus your own reflections at an angle.\n\nThis is the most beautiful place to visit.

It is an overpriced tourist trap with absolutely no valuable content. Most of the wax pieces are not related to India. Sheesh Mahal is fake and was built for tourists only. If you want to see an authentic one, go to Amber fort.\n\nStick to the fort only, then you your extra time to visit something else."

Sheesh mahal at amer fort is much detailed and beautiful. 500 rupees for single room of sheesh mahal of not worth. (They will tell there are three rooms but it’s a single room). Cab driver was also forcing us to visit, it seems a tourist trap.\nThey will only 10 mins inside and also not worth of spending more time there.

The fort is open from 9:00 AM to 9:30 PM, giving you plenty of time to explore at your own pace.\n\nWe booked our own bike to get there — cost about ₹50 for parking, which is also fair considering the location and security.\n\nThe views from the top are absolutely stunning, especially during sunset. The fort itself is well-maintained and offers a mix of history, architecture, and panoramic city views.

The architecture is stunning — a grand, beautifully detailed building that stands out in the heart of Jaipur. Inside, the museum is full of ancient treasures: intricate stone carvings, traditional paintings, royal weapons, textiles, coins, and many fascinating items once used by kings. It’s like stepping back in time. Everything is well-organized and informative. Even though I visited in the daytime, the museum was still full of charm and elegance. Highly recommend spending 1–2 hours here if you’re in Jaipur!"

That's why I also noted this thing because when I went to Jaipur, this rickshaw driver told me that you have come here. We have a shop here. Come to the showroom, then I came to know later that the work of cutting is done here day after day. That's why I request that whenever you go around, go alone and always alone."

The Sheesh Mahal is simply magical........the tiny mirrors sparkle beautifully, even in the faintest light.\nI’d highly recommend taking a local guide........they share fascinating stories, little-known facts, and bring the fort’s past to life in a way that signboards never can. The architecture is stunning........with a perfect blend of Rajput charm and Mughal elegance, and the views of Maota Lake from the top are picture-perfect.\nIf you can........arrive early to enjoy the elephant ride up to the fort........it’s a unique, royal touch to the experience. For a different vibe........there’s also a light and sound show in the evening that tells the fort’s history beautifully.\nAmber Fort isn’t just a sightseeing spot........it’s a walk through Rajasthan’s glorious past........and honestly........it’s one of Jaipur’s must-visits."

              "reviewText": "Amer Fort is one of those places that instantly makes you feel connected to history. As you climb up towards the fort, the grand walls and gateways welcome you with a sense of royalty. The architecture is a beautiful mix of Rajput and Mughal styles, and every corner from the Diwan-e-Aam to the lush gardens feels like a glimpse into the past.\n\nThe highlight for me was the Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace). Standing inside, I couldn’t help but imagine how it must have looked centuries ago when lit with just a single lamp, making the whole hall sparkle like the night sky. The view from the fort overlooking Maota Lake is equally breathtaking and gives you a sense of calm despite the crowds.\n\nIt does get a bit busy, especially on weekends, but that only shows how loved this place is. If you can, visit either early in the morning or stay for the evening light and sound show it really brings the history alive in a magical way. Overall, Amer Fort is not just a monument, it’s an experience you carry with you long after you leave."

The courtyards are stunning and the grounds are very clean. Cool tunnels to go up and lookout, and tunnels that lead to other forts (which are prohibited). We took the elephant ride up to the top, which was not the most comfortable ride but I feel like one has to do it. What’s really annoying, and unenjoyable is the constant hawkers. They start when you arrive, while you get on the elephant, and the ENTIRE trip up to the top-not taking NO for an answer!  Once at the top, we tipped our mahout and apparently that was not good enough for him-even tho a big sign said “no tipping”.  Stay away and say no to the photographers, they hounded us from the exit all the way to our car and even in our car!! We even had one show up the the restaurant when we walked out-simply RIDICULOUS!  All in all, the fort is beautiful and spacious and clean, it was the extraneous bits that were extremely annoying!"

The elephant ride is a part of the charm for sure and they are beautifully decorated. The hawkers are plentiful and super aggressive but if you don’t make eye contact they do leave you alone. We saw a few others engage in angry conversations so unless you have intent to buy, I’d suggest not looking or speaking to them. There are 120 working elephants here and it seemed like most of the visitors used them to climb to the fort. I think you can walk up but I’m not sure. Even on the way up the hawkers are shouting at you and part way there are a ton of photographers trying to get you to pose so they can harass you at the top to buy. The elephant drivers start reminding you to tip as soon as you enter the courtyard and just a few rupees will suffice. The complex is huge and we would recommend a guide to understand what you are seeing. The section of mirrored walls is spectacular and there are many spots throughout the complex where amazing pictures can be taken. Our guide also suggested we peek into the keyholes of a few sections that were closed off and we did see some amazing things in these areas not currently open.  Lots to see here and I’m sure the 1.5 hours we spent just scratched the surface. Student charges is just 10 INR."

I know it's heritage hotel but there furniture is outdated it's not antique at all atleast in our apartment we stayed.\nWe were told it has kitchen but it wasn't there not even fridge it was provided after we made them aware of issue.\nWashrooms were not clean specifically taps and shower heads some taps were not working. One washroom had no door lock to lock while someone is using it.\nCarpet was filthy and very dirty TV was from 1990s.\nThey need to do lot of work in that accommodation compare how much they are charging for it.\nOverall it wasn't a great experience most of the staff was helpful and did best to their abilities. Will not recommend friends and family."

As you explore its majestic courtyards, intricate carvings, and mirror-studded halls, you can feel the grandeur of Rajput architecture. The blend of Hindu and Mughal styles is captivating, and the elephant rides or jeep rides up to the fort add to the adventure. Amer Fort is a must-visit for anyone who wants to experience Rajasthan’s regal history and culture."

Each corner of the fort feels like a step back in time, with its grand courtyards, intricate mirror work, beautiful gates, and strong fortified walls. The views from the top are simply amazing, overlooking the city and the surrounding hills. We really enjoyed exploring its stories, taking photos, and soaking in the royal atmosphere.

In good shape and al lot of little sections to explore from community meeting areas to mirror rooms that are strategically designed to create illusions of location, to semi private screened open area window that gave women privacy, but also allowed the breezes to blow through and reduce the heat!\nYou will see a long wall area as well that rolls through the hills, not as long as Kumbhalghar but still significant nonetheless.\nAlso don't skip the hidden gem of the step well, as you could easily pass by it without realizing!\nDefinitely arrange for a guide to help walk you through all the history of the palace fort and the mogul influence and rule in Rajasthan."

Guides are not very expensive (up to ₹400) and make the trip more informative and are well-versed in almost all the languages of the world. The entry fee was about ₹600 for two adults and two children. It involves a lot of walking. That's both fitness and knowledge in a single place! There are many good places to take photos. Overall it’s a good experience and should be considered a must-visit. Very informative. There’s also a demonstration of how people did cloth and wall paintings in the olden days. A lot of foreign tourists can be seen around.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: Taxis can go up to the fort entrance and one need not walk the whole path from the base of the mountain. ⛰️ altogether a nice place 👍👍"

The fort's stunning architecture, intricate carvings, and breathtaking views of the surrounding hills made it one of the highlights of my trip to Jaipur. The historical richness and majestic design truly showcase the grandeur of Rajasthan’s royal heritage.\n\nI highly recommend hiring a guide during your visit. The guide shared fascinating stories, historical facts, and cultural insights that added so much depth to the experience. It really helped me appreciate the significance of each area within the fort, from the beautiful Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace) to the sprawling courtyards.The entire atmosphere was magical, especially during the early morning hours when the fort is quieter and the light is perfect for photos. Whether you're interested in history, architecture, or just enjoying scenic beauty, Amber Fort has something for everyone.\n\nI am fully satisfied with the visit and would definitely recommend it to others. Don’t miss it if you're in Jaipur!"

It’s not just a monument; it’s a breath, a glimpse into royal lives, and a haven of artistry.\nI’d recommend going early—beat the heat, catch the gentle light, and let yourself be still for a moment. Let the wind, the pink walls, and the stairs carry you a little away from today and into something tender and timeless."

Although there were a few areas under construction, the overall ambiance was impressive.\n\nHowever, one thing that bothered me was the ticket pricing. The charges are quite high, with separate fees for different sections and museums inside the palace, which can be frustrating. Considering it’s a historical site, it would be great if the ticket prices were kept more affordable so everyone can appreciate and learn from this heritage."

The fort is open from 9:00 AM to 9:30 PM, giving you plenty of time to explore at your own pace.\n\nWe booked our own bike to get there — cost about ₹50 for parking, which is also fair considering the location and security.\n\nThe views from the top are absolutely stunning, especially during sunset. The fort itself is well-maintained and offers a mix of history, architecture, and panoramic city views. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Jaipur!\n\nWould recommend bringing water and wearing comfortable shoes, especially if you plan to walk around a lot. Overall, a memorable and budget-friendly experience. 👍"

Nahargarh, which means the abode of tigers, provided a formidable defence against the enemies in the olden days. Today, the palace remains a popular spot for local picnics and a major tourist attraction. The palace features 12 identical boudoirs for the queens and a suite for the king, all connected by corridors and adorned with intricate murals. The fort looks splendid especially when illuminated at night and offers dazzling view of the city lights below."

The symmetrical steps and geometric design are truly fascinating — it's a great spot for photography and soaking in some quiet history. It's not as crowded as other tourist sites, which makes the experience even more peaceful.\n\nSome interesting stories about its historical use for water conservation and as a community gathering spot, especially for women in earlier times. You can't go down the steps anymore (as per current rules), but even from the top, the view is stunning.\n\nIn front of the kund, there’s an ancient temple that adds to the charm and spiritual feel of the place. It’s a small but beautifully carved temple, and visiting it makes the whole experience even more special. The peaceful atmosphere around both the stepwell and the temple gives a glimpse into the cultural and architectural richness of Rajasthan.\n\nIf you're in Jaipur, definitely make time for this — it's just a short drive from the Amer Fort!"

Visitors can only enjoy its scenic beauty from the shore. The best time to visit is early morning—perfect for a peaceful walk, fresh air, and a pleasant view. The calm lake, cool breeze, and feeding the fishes add to the experience. A great spot to sit, relax, and enjoy the surroundings. Ideal for individuals, couples, and families. A must-visit photo stop while exploring Jaipur."

The park inside makes it a ideal place to spend time with family. The musical fountain & small eateries are useful too.\n\nA must visit place for those coming to jaipur, different from the usual places that we are used to see."

The architecture is stunning — a grand, beautifully detailed building that stands out in the heart of Jaipur. Inside, the museum is full of ancient treasures: intricate stone carvings, traditional paintings, royal weapons, textiles, coins, and many fascinating items once used by kings. It’s like stepping back in time. Everything is well-organized and informative. Even though I visited in the daytime, the museum was still full of charm and elegance. Highly recommend spending 1–2 hours here if you’re in Jaipur!"

As you climb up towards the fort, the grand walls and gateways welcome you with a sense of royalty. The architecture is a beautiful mix of Rajput and Mughal styles, and every corner from the Diwan-e-Aam to the lush gardens feels like a glimpse into the past.\n\nThe highlight for me was the Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace). Standing inside, I couldn’t help but imagine how it must have looked centuries ago when lit with just a single lamp, making the whole hall sparkle like the night sky. The view from the fort overlooking Maota Lake is equally breathtaking and gives you a sense of calm despite the crowds.\n\nIt does get a bit busy, especially on weekends, but that only shows how loved this place is. If you can, visit either early in the morning or stay for the evening light and sound show it really brings the history alive in a magical way. Overall, Amer Fort is not just a monument, it’s an experience you carry with you long after you leave."

The courtyards are stunning and the grounds are very clean. Cool tunnels to go up and lookout, and tunnels that lead to other forts (which are prohibited). We took the elephant ride up to the top, which was not the most comfortable ride but I feel like one has to do it. What’s really annoying, and unenjoyable is the constant hawkers. They start when you arrive, while you get on the elephant, and the ENTIRE trip up to the top-not taking NO for an answer!  Once at the top, we tipped our mahout and apparently that was not good enough for him-even tho a big sign said “no tipping”.  Stay away and say no to the photographers, they hounded us from the exit all the way to our car and even in our car!! We even had one show up the the restaurant when we walked out-simply RIDICULOUS!  All in all, the fort is beautiful and spacious and clean, it was the extraneous bits that were extremely annoying!"

              "reviewText": "This place is amazing. It’s gigantic and so well preserved. We had a driver so didn’t need to contend with the walk or the jeeps moving you from parking lot to base. The elephant ride is a part of the charm for sure and they are beautifully decorated. The hawkers are plentiful and super aggressive but if you don’t make eye contact they do leave you alone. We saw a few others engage in angry conversations so unless you have intent to buy, I’d suggest not looking or speaking to them. There are 120 working elephants here and it seemed like most of the visitors used them to climb to the fort. I think you can walk up but I’m not sure. Even on the way up the hawkers are shouting at you and part way there are a ton of photographers trying to get you to pose so they can harass you at the top to buy. The elephant drivers start reminding you to tip as soon as you enter the courtyard and just a few rupees will suffice. The complex is huge and we would recommend a guide to understand what you are seeing. The section of mirrored walls is spectacular and there are many spots throughout the complex where amazing pictures can be taken. Our guide also suggested we peek into the keyholes of a few sections that were closed off and we did see some amazing things in these areas not currently open.  Lots to see here and I’m sure the 1.5 hours we spent just scratched the surface. Student charges is just 10 INR."

Its many nice view points on the city, the sun temple and also some other small temples and shrines, its like a pilgrimate path so you dont wanna miss this part by going with the tuktuk, car or bus and arriving to the other side of the valley. So warning: If you do so it is only half beautiful and takes away the best part, so not being lacy and walking will reward you with more nice fotos and view points and some temples and shrines! I guess if you do it with the car like most indians its not special at all and that is thevreason the place has not a 5star rating. So by walking you will pass some small temples and beautiful plants in many colours and arrive through the valley to a small pool with a dam where its already the first pack of monkeys! After it is possible to walk down the stairs and come to the main bath pool withba small waterfall from the dam. more down its another big pool and some beautiful buildings, also it will be more monkeys! After following you will come to another beautiful shive temple with a very friendly baba."

The Sheesh Mahal is simply magical........the tiny mirrors sparkle beautifully, even in the faintest light.\nI’d highly recommend taking a local guide........they share fascinating stories, little-known facts, and bring the fort’s past to life in a way that signboards never can. The architecture is stunning........with a perfect blend of Rajput charm and Mughal elegance, and the views of Maota Lake from the top are picture-perfect.\nIf you can........arrive early to enjoy the elephant ride up to the fort........it’s a unique, royal touch to the experience. For a different vibe........there’s also a light and sound show in the evening that tells the fort’s history beautifully.\nAmber Fort isn’t just a sightseeing spot........it’s a walk through Rajasthan’s glorious past........and honestly........it’s one of Jaipur’s must-visits."

There are plenty of birds and squirrels all around to make you feel surrounded by nature. Lots of plants, trees and flowers. The multi-level historical structures are a jewel in the crown of this place. The paintings and sculptures all around are a delight to behold.\nWould've been great if the fountains were made functional.\n\nBut definitely a place worth visiting! A beautiful historical garden!"

The palace at the top adds charm with its Rajasthani and Mughal architectural blend. Temples dedicated to Lord Shiva, Vishnu, and Hanuman inside the complex make it even more serene.\n\nA hidden gem in Jaipur—calm, photogenic, and historically rich.

The moment you step into this part of the fort, you’re greeted by a dazzling sight — walls and ceilings covered in thousands of tiny convex mirrors, intricate glass mosaics, and floral patterns inlaid with precious stones. Even a single candle or ray of sunlight transforms the whole hall into a shimmering galaxy of reflections.\n\nBuilt during the reign of Maharaja Man Singh in the 16th century and further enhanced by later rulers, Sheesh Mahal was used as a royal reception hall and private chamber for the queens. One of its most fascinating features is its ability to illuminate with minimal light — a single flame could create the effect of a starry night sky, allowing the royals to enjoy beauty and warmth without open flames.\n\nThe craftsmanship here is beyond words. Every mirror piece is hand-cut, and every floral motif is painted with natural colors, showing the unmatched skill of artisans from centuries ago. It’s not just architecture; it’s poetry in glass and stone.\n\nPhotography here is an absolute delight, but nothing compares to seeing it with your own eyes — the way light dances across the walls feels almost magical. The area is well-maintained, though due to preservation efforts, some parts are restricted for visitors, which is understandable given its delicate nature.\n\nIf you’re visiting Amber Fort, Sheesh Mahal is the heart of the experience. Take your time here, look closely at the details, and imagine the royal gatherings, music, and laughter that once filled this sparkling hall.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

Built in the 17th century by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, this magnificent structure was designed with a specific purpose: to allow the queen to experience a starry night sky without having to sleep in the open.\n​Its most striking feature is the intricate mirror work that covers the walls and ceilings.  Thousands of tiny, convex mirrors and colored glass pieces are meticulously arranged in complex floral and geometric patterns. This design creates a breathtaking effect where a single ray of light or the flame of a single candle is reflected countless times, illuminating the entire hall in a dazzling, star-like glow.\n​The exquisite craftsmanship is a testament to the skill of the artisans of that time, who painstakingly hand-cut and inlaid each piece. The architectural details, including the use of white marble and the blend of Islamic and Rajasthani motifs, demonstrate a sophisticated fusion of styles. This fusion makes the Sheesh Mahal a unique and captivating part of the Amer Fort complex.\n​While entry to the inner chamber is now restricted to preserve the delicate artwork, visitors can still admire its splendor from the outside. The Sheesh Mahal stands as a symbol of royal opulence, artistic excellence, and a king's profound love, making it a truly unforgettable sight."

There could be a waiting time during peak season so be prepared for it. The service is a bit slow. The staff are nice and polite but it seems they have less staff to manage the peak crowd. If you visit Jaipur for vacation then this place can be on your bucket list for a relaxed lunch with an amazing view of Hawa Mahal."

I stumbled upon it while exploring the area and was instantly drawn in by the rooftop seating and the scenic view and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. Sitting on the terrace with a direct view of Hawa Mahal was surreal. Whether you're there during the golden hours of sunset or at night, the view is breathtaking.\n\nBeyond the view, the cafe has a chilled-out vibe with quirky decor and a laid-back atmosphere that makes it a great spot to relax. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the service was smooth. As for the food, it was genuinely good. I tried some Chinese and Indian items, and everything tasted fresh and flavorful. The portion sizes were generous, and the pricing was reasonable considering the location. It's the kind of place where you can spend hours—whether you're catching up with friends, or just soaking in the Jaipur charm. If you are in the city, especially around the old town, Tattoo Cafe is definitely worth a stop. It’s not just a cafe, it’s an experience with a view."

We had heard about the great view of the Hawa Mahal, and it absolutely lived up to the hype.\n\nTo reach the café, you climb a number of stairs lined with small shops on either side, spread across different levels. Just before the final staircase, there's someone at the entrance charging a small fee, which is redeemable as a voucher for food and drinks—so it felt totally fair.\n\nThe café is spread over two levels: the first floor is indoors, offering a cool retreat from the sun, while the rooftop terrace on the second floor is where the magic happens. With parasols for shade and an unbeatable view of the Hawa Mahal right across the street, it’s a great spot to relax and soak in the city’s energy from above.\n\nWe liked it so much, we ended up going twice. Between us, we tried the coffee, masala chai, pancakes, and naan—all were solid and hit the spot, though the view is definitely the highlight.\n\nA cozy, atmospheric place to rest your feet, grab a bite, and enjoy one of Jaipur’s most iconic views."

As the sun set, we wandered into this beautiful mandir and were welcomed by local children, the priest, and the temple keepers. The energy here was profound,  it resonated with a mother’s love.\n\nThe temple itself was built in the early 1600s by Queen Kanakavati in memory of her son Jagat Singh. Dedicated to Krishna, Vishnu, and Meera Bai, it feels both intimate and timeless. The stone artistry is absolutely breathtaking, with carved details that seem alive in the evening light.\n\nThis temple resonates with the soul of place, a place to sink into and feel with your heart as you connect to all. One of the most meaningful discoveries of our Amber walk."

Built between 1599 and 1608 AD by Queen Kanakwati in memory of her son Jagat Singh, the temple holds historical and spiritual significance. It houses the same idol of Lord Krishna worshiped by Meera Bai, a devoted saint and poet, over 600 years ago. This idol was saved from destruction during the Mughal war with Mewar state and later brought to Amer.\n\nWhat makes this temple unique is that it is the only one in the world where idols of Lord Krishna and Meera Bai are worshiped together. Meera Bai considered Lord Krishna her spiritual husband, and the temple reflects their special bond. With its rich history and spiritual value, the Jagat Shiromani Temple is a monument of national importance and an essential part of Amer's heritage.\n\nThe Jagat Shiromani Temple is a masterpiece of Rajasthani architecture, with intricate carvings and stunning designs that transport you to a world of divine beauty. Its majestic structure, adorned with sculptures of trumpeting elephants and horses, seems to come alive with stories from mythological texts. The temple's strategic location on a small hill adds to its grandeur, making it a breathtaking sight to behold. As you step inside, the serene atmosphere and exquisite craftsmanship will leave you spellbound, making it a must-visit destination for anyone who appreciates art, history, and spirituality."

This time my friend forced me into it, watched Malik here, the theater is all upgraded in sound and video quality. Loved the traditional sitting arrangement of Dress Circle, Balcony, and Box. The price is on the costlier side, but maybe it is because it is more of a tourist destination than a cinema. They have a locker (cloakroom) facility, which is very helpful for people who are there for shopping."

Known as one of the most beautiful cinemas in India, its grand Art Deco architecture, luxurious interiors, and royal ambiance make movie-watching a truly memorable experience.\n\nThe auditorium is spacious, with comfortable seating and an old-world charm that adds to the overall atmosphere. The lighting, ceiling design, and curtain-raising before the movie begins give a nostalgic, theatrical feel that you won’t find in modern multiplexes.\n\nsound and screen quality are quite good. Located in the heart of the city, it’s easy to reach and often included in city tours.\n\nEven if you're not a movie buff, a visit to Raj Mandir is worth it for the architecture and experience alone. A must-visit cultural icon in Jaipur."

It is the meringue-shaped auditorium opened in 1976, and over the years has seen many movie premieres of Hindi films, and has become a popular symbol of Jaipur. The theatre often referred to as 'Cinema Ka Mandir' is equipped with the latest technology in sound and projection with Dolby Atmos, the first in the state of Rajasthan. An important landmark and tourist destination, the cinema hall has been accorded the status of largest single screen theatre in Asia. The movie theater offers a unique cinematic experience with a large screen and immersive sound system. The interiors are grand and royal, with stunning architecture, colorful lights, and a vintage charm. Feels more like a heritage destination than a regular cinema. Clean toilets, comfortable seats, food and beverages, amazing interiors, beautiful hallways and mesmerizing lighting will make your visit worth to this place."

While it was lovely to see all of the monkeys roaming around, for a popular tourist attraction the temple was not well looked after and there was trash everywhere, arguably the most littered temple I’ve been to so far in India. Quite sad to see all of the monkeys and other animals eating the rubbish that was in the river, which ruined the entire experience. The people that work here are only there to get your money, they commented that the rubbish situation was awful but had no incentive to clear up. There were no bins anywhere either, which would have significantly helped. There is an additional charge to take pictures, which costs more than the entrance ticket and is an outright scam!. Hope someone with authority sees this comment and decides to take action. Very disappointing."

              "reviewText": "Jawhar – A Hidden Gem of Maharashtra That Deserves the Spotlight\n\nOur recent trip to Jawhar was a delightful surprise. Often overlooked for more commercial hill stations, Jawhar is a serene, culturally rich destination tucked away in the Palghar district of Maharashtra, just a few hours’ drive from Mumbai or Nashik.\n\nWhat immediately strikes you about Jawhar is its unspoiled natural beauty. Surrounded by rolling hills, dense forests, and cascading waterfalls, the landscape feels untouched and peaceful. The drive itself is scenic, especially during the monsoon, when the greenery is at its peak and the weather is pleasantly cool.\n\nOne of the highlights was our visit to Dabhosa Waterfall, one of the highest waterfalls in Maharashtra. The sight and sound of the water plunging into the valley below was both thrilling and calming. The Jai Vilas Palace, built in a fusion of tribal and European styles, offers a peek into the royal heritage of the region and is set against a beautiful hilly backdrop.\n\nJawhar is also rich in tribal culture, especially that of the Warli tribe, known for their iconic Warli art. We were lucky to interact with some local artisans and witness them create intricate pieces—something truly memorable and unique to the region.\n\nDespite being a smaller town, we found clean, comfortable homestays and eco-resorts, along with simple yet hearty Maharashtrian food served with warmth. The locals are welcoming and always ready to share stories about their town, making the experience all the more authentic.\n\nWhether you’re looking to unwind in nature, explore offbeat trails, or experience tribal culture up close, Jawhar offers all of this without the touristy chaos. It’s peaceful, picturesque, and has a distinct charm of its own.\n\nWe left Jawhar feeling refreshed, inspired, and already planning a return trip. Highly recommended for those looking for a soulful and scenic escape!"

The attitude of Manager and other staff was not at all cooperative and least bothered about their customers.\n\nTheir food was stale which was not even worth eating it for free.\nTheir pizza either veg or non-veg tasted terrible, not fresh or crispy.\nPasta was loaded with ketchup flavours, Crispy Fish was tasting of bater with no fish flavour. Their drinks were terrible.\n\nSo on the whole, bad experience with wastage of money and time.\nHorrible place.\nThe only good thing about the place is the ambiance.. So for a ONLY a beer, click pics and comeback...\n\nI would not even rate it .5 star.\n\nThank you!"

It's a great location for photography, especially during daytime when natural light enhances its historical beauty. The area is quieter and more peaceful compared to other tourist spots, making it an offbeat gem worth exploring on a leisurely Sunday visit.",

The kids love feeding the pigeons and chasing them. Children and adults can indulge in horse riding or simply take a round in the horse carts, locally called 'tanga'. The building houses a historical and art museum with interesting relics of the past. Centuries old artefacts, dolls, blue pottery, stone relics, armory, etc. There's a lot to see and learn there. It also houses an Egyptian mummy alongwith beautiful terracotta and glazed pottery relics.\nOverall an incredible experience... Do add it in your itinerary."
