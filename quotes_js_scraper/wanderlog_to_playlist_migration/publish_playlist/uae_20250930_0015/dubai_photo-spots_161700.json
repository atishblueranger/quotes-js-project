Now that it's more permanent, I kind of expected better value in terms of pricing. But honestly, the prices are still way too high for most items.\n\nWhat's a bit of a letdown is how, after checking out a few country stalls, you start to notice the same shops and products popping up again and again. It feels like more than half the stalls across different countries are just repeating versions of each other. That repetition takes away from the excitement of exploring something new in each zone.\n\nStill, visually, it's a treat. The architecture, the lights, the performances-it's like a global festival rolled into one place. But if they could bring down the prices for common items and add more unique local crafts or experiences, it would definitely feel more worth it. For now, it's great for a walk, some photos, and soaking in the vibe-but not for shopping.",

The whole place had a vibrant atmosphere and was thoughtfully set up, with something to suit all ages, including young kids, teenagers, adults, and older visitors too. There was a great mix of activities and performances, and the food options were endless. We tried so many different dishes, some we had never even heard of before, and each one brought something new to the table. It was a real treat for the senses. One thing to be aware of is that some of the salespeople inside the pavilions can be quite pushy. If you stop to browse or try something on, they tend to follow up quite strongly. But with a bit of good humour and patience, it is easy enough to manage. It is also worth knowing that haggling is a must, as the first price offered is often quite a bit higher than what you can actually pay. All in all, Global Village is an absolute must-do when you are in Dubai. There is so much to explore and enjoy, and you will want more than just one evening to take it all in properly.

Sometimes, even standing outside a landmark can leave a lasting impression - and that's exactly what the Dubai Frame did.\n\nThe structure is massive, magnificent, and truly an architectural marvel. From the outside, it's already a feast for the eyes. The surrounding area is well-maintained and positive in energy. You'll spot people jogging, families relaxing, and even an open gym nearby - it's a lively and welcoming atmosphere.\n\nI genuinely wished I could have taken my family inside to experience the panoramic view they talk about - one side showing modern, developed Dubai and the other side reflecting the city's humble past and growing future. A friend who visited inside told me the contrast of the two views from the top really gives you chills - a reflection of how far this city has come.\n\nIf you're planning a trip and your budget allows it, I highly recommend adding the Dubai Frame to your list. It's not just about the view - it's about giving yourself and your loved ones a moment to admire progress, beauty, and the skyline that defines a dream city. Even if you stay outside, the vibe alone is worth it.\n\n✨ Tip: Save a little for experiences like this - it reminds you why investing in memories is priceless.",

The design alone is breathtaking - a massive golden frame that beautifully symbolizes the city's journey from past to present to future. The lower level gives you a fascinating look at Dubai's history, while the upper sky deck offers stunning panoramic views of both old and modern Dubai.\n\nThe glass floor walkway is a highlight - a little thrilling but totally safe - and makes for amazing photos. The entire experience is well organized, with friendly staff, clean facilities, and plenty of information to help you appreciate what you're seeing.\n\nWhether you're a tourist or a resident, Dubai Frame is a must-visit landmark that captures the spirit of the city in one spectacular stop. Highly recommended, especially at sunset for the most magical views!",

It offers a quick, scenic ascent with minimal wait time.\nObservation Deck & Glass Floor: The views from the top are stunning, and the glass floor walkway adds a fun, slightly daring twist that's great for photos.\nMuseum Experience: The ground-level museum gives an engaging overview of Dubai's past, present, and future in a compact and visually rich format.\n\nNote: It can get crowded during peak hours, especially near the glass floor section.\n\nThe entire visit can be done in about 45–60 minutes, making it a perfect quick stop for tourists with a tight itinerary.",

Every corner of the garden feels magical.\n\nIt's a wonderful experience for both young and old, with plenty of photo opportunities and beautiful spots to explore. However, I definitely recommend booking your tickets in advance to skip the queues and make the most of your visit.\n\nAlso, try to go early in the day-the heat in the afternoon can be quite intense, and there aren't many shaded areas (which is understandable, given the nature of the gardens and the flowers). Going early allows you to enjoy everything comfortably before it gets too hot.\n\nOverall, an unforgettable experience and a must-see when in Dubai!",

Our tickets included access to the underwater tunnel, a glass tunnel built inside the massive aquarium, where we could see all kinds of sea creatures swimming around us. My daughter absolutely loved it, and it was a unique way to experience marine life up close.\n\nAfter the tunnel, we went up two floors to the Underwater Zoo, where we explored a wide variety of fish, penguins, and even crocodiles. The zoo section is well-organized and provides plenty of interesting exhibits. Inside the facility, I also discovered several additional activities, such as the penguin encounter, a glass-bottom boat ride inside the aquarium, and fish-feeding experiences.\n\nOne downside was that I wasn't aware of the need for advance reservations for certain activities. When I tried to book the penguin encounter on the spot, I was told the next available slot was in two hours. So, for anyone planning to visit, I highly recommend booking extra experiences in advance to avoid long waits.\n\nOverall, it was an enjoyable and unique experience. The combination of the underwater tunnel and the zoo provides plenty to see and do, making it a great attraction, especially for families with kids. Highly recommended!",

The building itself is stunning from the outside, but what's inside is even more impressive. Each floor takes you on a journey into different aspects of the future - from space exploration to AI, sustainability, and nature.\n\nThe space section was a big highlight for us, especially for the kids, as it felt like being on a real space station. The environment and ecosystem exhibits were also very engaging, showing futuristic ideas on how technology can help preserve nature. Everything is interactive and immersive, so it never feels like a regular museum visit - it's more like stepping into the future itself.\n\nThe staff was helpful throughout and made the flow easy. With kids, it was very manageable since the layout is well thought out, and there are plenty of areas to pause and absorb the experience. We spent around 3 hours inside and could have easily stayed longer.\n\nIt's one of the most unique attractions in Dubai, combining education, technology, and entertainment all in one. Definitely worth visiting with family, and I'd highly recommend booking tickets in advance because it's always in demand.",

It was a place she had long wanted to see, and I'm truly glad we made the time to visit-it turned out to be one of the most meaningful stops of our trip.\n\nSet in a well-maintained and elegant atmosphere, Wings of Mexico offers a refreshing contrast to the typical hustle of central Dubai. The surroundings were clean, calm, and surprisingly free from the usual clutter of tourist-heavy spots. Located in an area frequented by European tourists and expats, it carried a peaceful charm that felt like a perfect getaway within the city.\n\nOne of the most amusing yet admirable parts was the queue of people patiently waiting to take pictures in front of the iconic wings. It's completely free, and yet the discipline and order among the visitors made the whole experience even more enjoyable. And of course, the real magic lies in the picture-perfect alignment-posing with the stunning Wings of Mexico sculpture and having the majestic \"Burj Khalifa\" right behind in the same frame. It's a postcard moment you'll always remember.\n\nWhat made the visit truly special for me was seeing my wife and family enjoy it with such joy in their eyes. Knowing they were only days away from returning home, this visit gave us a beautiful memory to cherish-a reminder of Dubai's elegance and charm to carry with them back to Kerala.\n\nIf you're in Dubai, I highly recommend taking the time to visit Wings of Mexico. It's not just a photo spot-it's an experience, a piece of art, and a moment of beauty that's well worth the visit.",

From the moment I arrived, I was impressed by how clean and well-organized everything was. The beach is wide and spacious, allowing everyone to enjoy without feeling overcrowded, even on weekends.\n\nThe facilities here are excellent there are plenty of showers, changing rooms, and clean restrooms. Lifeguards are always present, making it a very safe place for families with children. There's also a long jogging and walking track along the beach, which is great for anyone who wants to stay active while enjoying the ocean breeze.\n\nThe view of the Burj Al Arab in the background adds a luxurious touch to the entire experience. It's a perfect spot for photography, especially around sunset when the colors in the sky are absolutely breathtaking.\n\nThere are many cafés and food stalls nearby, offering refreshing juices, snacks, and meals. I grabbed a coffee from a beachside café and simply relaxed while listening to the sound of the waves it was the perfect break from the busy city life.\n\nParking is available but can be a bit crowded during peak times, so arriving early is a good idea. There are also options for renting sun loungers and umbrellas if you plan to stay for a few hours.\n\nOverall, Jumeirah Beach offers the perfect mix of relaxation, fun, and natural beauty. Whether you want to swim, exercise, picnic, or just unwind, this beach has something for everyone. Definitely a must-visit when you're in Dubai!",

The observatory offers a panoramic glass floor, a transparent slide, a café, and several other attractions.\n\nThere are automatic cameras installed at key spots like the entrance, the glass slide, and the glass floor, which take your photos during the experience. To view or purchase the photos, you need to visit a designated photo booth.\n\nHowever, I must point out that one of the staff members at the photo booth was extremely rude and spoke to us in a very dismissive and unpleasant manner. It was a disappointing experience and I strongly urge the management at Sky Views Observatory to pay closer attention to how their staff interacts with visitors. Customer service should be a priority, especially in a tourist destination like this.\n\nAs for the photos themselves - printing a single photo costs 135 AED, and there were about 15 photos taken in total. If you want to receive the photos digitally, you can only do so by purchasing *all* of them, which costs around 350 AED. This includes 3 printed photos. Unfortunately, there's no option to choose just a few digital images or pay for them individually - it's either one photo or the full package.\n\nConsidering the ticket price is 80 AED, the cost of the photos feels very excessive. I understand that this is a tourist attraction, but these prices seem unreasonable. Also, I should mention that the quality of the photos was not impressive. In fact, many of the pictures were lower quality than what you could take with a phone. Some photos were poorly edited with artificial backgrounds that looked quite unprofessional.\n\nI sincerely hope that Sky Views Observatory improves both its customer service and photo service in the future. ♥️",

It was not only educational but also engaging, making our visit even more memorable.\nThe staff were exceptionally friendly and welcoming, adding a warm touch to our adventure. They were always available to answer questions and share their passion for marine conservation.\nDon't forget to check out the souvenir shop before you leave!

I paid for 3 adult tickets (baby was free), expecting a worthwhile experience – but sadly, it was very underwhelming.\n\nWe were done walking through the entire aquarium in just 10-15 minutes. The exhibits were nice, but honestly, you can get a better view of the aquarium for free from the outside areas of the hotel, which makes the paid entry feel like a waste.\n\nThe real issue came when my daughter needed a diaper change. I was shocked to learn they don't have proper baby-changing facilities inside. A staff member at the exit area told us to go outside the aquarium to change her. But when we returned, the lady at the entrance refused to let us back in – despite the fact that we had just been told we could re-enter. She did eventually anyway after a few discussion about it.\n\nThis shows a clear lack of communication between staff and left us feeling frustrated and disappointed. For a venue like Atlantis that caters to families and charges premium prices, I expected far better service and facilities.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this experience – especially if you're visiting with a baby or expecting a long, enriching aquarium visit. Definitely not worth the price.",

Set along the beautiful Dubai Creek, Al Seef blends old-world charm with modern vibes seamlessly. The architecture is a stunning mix of traditional Emirati design and contemporary aesthetics, making it a great place for photography lovers and culture enthusiasts. The best time to visit is definitely in the evening. As the sun sets, the entire area lights up beautifully, creating a magical atmosphere. The creek comes alive with boats and dhows, and there's a calming breeze that makes your walk even more pleasant. The lighting, music, and ambiance are just perfect for a relaxing stroll. There are plenty of places to explore quaint cafes, boutique stores, art galleries, museums, and street-side stalls selling local crafts. I managed to visit most of the places, but Al Seef itself stood out as my favorite. It's not just a destination, it's an experience. Whether you're there to shop, eat, or just soak in the surroundings, there's something for everyone. Highly recommend it to tourists and even residents looking for a refreshing getaway within the city. A must visit in Dubai!",

However, since it was the weekend, the area was crowded with vehicles. Many people were setting up tents for overnight camping.\n\nOne major difficulty we faced was the lack of washrooms. If you're visiting with family and kids, this can be a significant issue. I didn't see any washrooms, though I'm not sure if they were available elsewhere.\n\nAnother challenge was the lack of proper lighting. This might be intentional due to the presence of wild animals-we saw many deer at night. Additionally, the place was dusty, with vehicles constantly moving around. If you have breathing issues, it's better to carry a mask.\n\nThere are no nearby shops, so it's best to bring enough water, a camping light, and all necessary supplies. The place is well-maintained, and I loved the ambience-a perfect escape from the busy town. You can do grilling, but you'll need to carry everything yourself.\n\nThe lake is beautiful, and we spotted flamingos, various ducks, and deer at night. However, navigating the roads at night can be difficult, as they are confusing, and you cannot entirely rely on maps.",

You are welcomed with a drink and staff is always ready to click your pics.\nThe lounge has some very delicious food, served by some very polite and courteous staff.\nWashrooms are very clean and there is  enough seating up there.\nOn the 124th floor, there are long lines for the elevators going down, but with Top Floor access, you get priority line to down going elevators too.",

It's something you have to see to believe. The entire city looked stunning, and we were able to capture countless amazing photos while soaking in the beauty.\n\nLevel 125 was equally impressive, featuring unique attractions and interactive experiences. Walking on the glass bridge and experiencing the breaking glass effect was thrilling and added a fun, surprising element to our visit. We shared many laughs and enjoyed every moment.\n\nThe staff throughout the visit were exceptionally kind, professional, and helpful. I would especially like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Awais Hashmi, the Guest Ambassador, whose warm hospitality and insightful guidance made our trip even more enjoyable. His tips and advice truly enhanced our overall experience, and we are deeply grateful.\n\nWe left with wonderful memories and are already planning to return next time, aiming even higher!\n\nThank you once again to the Burj Khalifa team, and a special thanks to \" Mr. Awais Hashmi \" for making our visit so special.",

From start to finish, the experience was seamless, luxurious, and truly awe-inspiring.\n\nThe VIP package is absolutely worth it - access to the 154th floor and the exclusive Sky Lounge waiting area makes all the difference. The lounge was peaceful, beautifully designed, and a great way to begin the experience away from the crowds.\n\nThe guided tour to the elevator was surprisingly informative - we learned so much about the building's design, construction, and significance. It really added depth and appreciation to the visit.\n\nA special thank you to Nadim in Lounge 154, who delivered exceptional service with such grace and professionalism. He made us feel welcome and well cared for, and his thoughtful attention to detail truly enhanced the experience.\n\nAnd of course, the views from the top were simply unforgettable - watching the sunset from the tallest building in the world is a memory we'll cherish forever.\n\nIf you're visiting Dubai, don't hesitate - go for the VIP package.

The path is clean, wide, and well-maintained, with ramps and railings that make it accessible for all. It's also a great location to catch views of passing boats and soak in the peaceful vibe right in the middle of the city.\n\nThe bridge symbolizes unity and harmony, which adds even more meaning to your visit. That said, it's one of those hidden gems that adds to Dubai's charm.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone who appreciates architecture, photography, or just wants to enjoy a quiet moment amidst the city lights.",
