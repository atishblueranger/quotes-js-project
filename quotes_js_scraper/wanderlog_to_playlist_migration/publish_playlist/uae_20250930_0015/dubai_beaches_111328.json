In my experience, they consistently perform their duties in a professional and commendable manner.\n\nHowever, I have growing concerns regarding their ability to enforce beach rules effectively, particularly during evening hours. I have witnessed numerous incidents where visitors violate regulations by consuming alcohol, harassing others, and swimming after sunset.\n\nMost troublingly, I have seen security personnel subjected to significant disrespect and intimidation when they attempt to address these violations politely. In one recent incident, a visitor who was repeatedly asked to exit the water after sunset responded by publicly threatening a guard, stating he would ensure the guard lost his job.\n\nWhen I later asked the guard why more assertive action wasn't taken, he explained that he felt unsupported by management. His belief was that should a visitor file a complaint, management would side with the visitor rather than with staff who are following protocol. This perception appears to be eroding their confidence and compromising their authority.\n\nWhile I understand the importance of customer satisfaction, it is critical that staff feel empowered and supported when professionally executing their duties. The current situation not only undermines their safety and morale but also jeopardizes the safety of all visitors.\n\nI urge you to review the protocols for supporting staff in these challenging situations. Measures such as clearer public signage, updated de-escalation training, and a demonstrated management policy of backing staff when they correctly enforce rules could significantly boost their confidence and effectiveness.\n\nThank you for your time and attention to this important matter. I am confident that addressing these concerns will create a safer and more enjoyable environment for both visitors and your valuable staff.\n\nSincerely,\n\nA Concerned Regular Visitor",

The beach is wide and spacious, allowing everyone to enjoy without feeling overcrowded, even on weekends.\n\nThe facilities here are excellent there are plenty of showers, changing rooms, and clean restrooms.

There's also a long jogging and walking track along the beach, which is great for anyone who wants to stay active while enjoying the ocean breeze.\n\nThe view of the Burj Al Arab in the background adds a luxurious touch to the entire experience. It's a perfect spot for photography, especially around sunset when the colors in the sky are absolutely breathtaking.\n\nThere are many cafés and food stalls nearby, offering refreshing juices, snacks, and meals. I grabbed a coffee from a beachside café and simply relaxed while listening to the sound of the waves it was the perfect break from the busy city life.\n\nParking is available but can be a bit crowded during peak times, so arriving early is a good idea. There are also options for renting sun loungers and umbrellas if you plan to stay for a few hours.\n\nOverall, Jumeirah Beach offers the perfect mix of relaxation, fun, and natural beauty.

The beach itself is very clean, and I appreciate the presence of lifeguards constantly patrolling for safety. There's also a net for those who want to play beach volleyball, adding to the fun activities available. The toilets are well-maintained and designed to accommodate many visitors. Plus, the 5 AED entrance fee is absolutely worth it! Conveniently, there's a bus stop right at the entrance, making it easy to access. Highly recommended for a perfect day out!",

A nice running track runs along the beach, and you'll find a small supermarket, pizzas and Subway nearby, including SALT to enjoy a nice burger.\n\nOnly downside is the water tends to be still, not ideal if you're expecting waves.

There's also a beautiful bridge that's definitely Instagram-worthy and adds a nice visual touch to the area.\n\nI also noticed that there are staff actively working to maintain the cleanliness of the beach area, which is great to see. However, despite their efforts, I still spotted some trash floating in the water, which was a bit disappointing. Hopefully, more can be done to keep the water as clean as the surroundings.\n\nOverall, it's a pleasant spot to relax, especially if you enjoy taking photos.

That was the real treat. For just 75 dirhams, I had access to a buffet that felt more like a curated culinary spread. From savory bites like salmon bagels and eggs benedict to sweet options like açai bowls, fresh fruit, flaky croissants, and even ice cream, everything was beautifully presented and full of flavor. There was a lovely cheese and charcuterie selection, and a rotation of smoothies that made you feel both indulgent and healthy at once. And yes, it was unlimited-food and drinks both-which made the value unbeatable.\n\nOne detail that truly stood out was the personal touch from Chef Ali. In the middle of the relaxed morning vibe, he came by with a warm smile to ask if everything was to my liking-and whether I had any suggestions for improving their service. It's rare to see that kind of care and humility from the person behind the kitchen, and it left a lasting impression. You could tell he wasn't just cooking meals-he was crafting an experience.\n\nWhat made it even better was being able to enjoy all this while still having full access to the pool and beach. No rushing, no moving around-you could enjoy your breakfast slowly, then wander down to the water or lounge at your sunbed with a fresh juice in hand.\n\nIt's rare to find a place that combines atmosphere, quality, and value so seamlessly-but this beach club nailed it. Whether you're in the mood for a relaxing solo morning or a full day with friends, it's the kind of place you'll want to return to again and again.",

Great for anyone looking for prestige and contacts. I'm taking off one star for the exorbitant prices.",

The cocktails were okay but a bit weak. Burgers were fine, and the fries were actually great. Unfortunately, the tacos were disappointing-bland, served in chips instead of tortillas, and only three small pieces for AED 190. Given the price, I expected much better quality and quantity.\n\nService – The staff were very polite and friendly, which I appreciated. However, it was difficult to get service at times-there often wasn't anyone around when we wanted to order. Also, being directly asked if we wanted to add a tip felt a bit uncomfortable.\n\nAmbience – The pool area is beautiful, with well-designed sunbeds, shades, and a great location right by the sea. It did get a bit too crowded and loud for my liking in the afternoon once the party vibe kicked in.",

However, it is right next to a construction site. In the morning (around 10-10:30 AM to 1 PM) it's peaceful and not too crowded, but after that it gets busy with people standing very close to your things (tourist that just finish Burj Al Arab tour) and still coming and taking pics on the beach right next to your stuff and belongings.\nAlso, most of construction workers also come to the beach even though they are not allowed to be there on that area only further away, they don't always behave respectfully , they asked me to take pictures with me and my mum was next to me in the water. They are recording themself in water and also record like selfies but you dont know if they actually record you or no.\nGentleman on scooter /  security guard went above and beyond, he tried to keep them away and let the other people enjoy on the beach and have a wonderful time with family, friends etc.\nLifeguards were very attentive, and they was always on point, telling people not to cross the buoy lines, their supervisor was going back and forth with a car, very nice.\nRestrooms , changing rooms, showers very clean.  10/10.\nAll this is my personal opinion, overall i love the beach, not so many ppl in the morning, just be ready for crowd from close to 1pm .",

There were plenty of shaded areas and spots to lay down a towel and unwind. Also loved the chill beach vibes-music playing in the background, families enjoying picnics, and people playing volleyball and having fun.\n\nThe little beach café nearby served cold drinks and snacks, which added to the overall relaxing vibe.

            "text": "Our Experience at Nikki Beach Dubai – A Touch of Luxury with Minor Imperfections\n\nToday, my wife and I spent the day at Nikki Beach Dubai, and overall, we were very impressed. As regular visitors to Dubai and frequent guests at many of the city's high-end beach clubs – from The Beach by FIVE to White Beach and Cove – we've developed a good sense for quality, service, and atmosphere. Nikki Beach certainly delivered on most fronts.\n\nThe ambience was elegant and refined. The venue is beautifully designed, clean, and well-maintained. The sunbeds were comfortable, the crowd was classy, and the staff was mostly attentive and courteous throughout our visit.\n\nOne of the standout highlights was definitely the food. Every dish we ordered was fresh, beautifully presented, and packed with flavor. We were genuinely impressed by the creativity of the kitchen and the attention to detail in taste and plating. The drinks were also well crafted and stylishly served.\n\nHowever, there were two minor details that slightly affected our overall impression:\n1.\tThe pool temperature was quite cold, which made swimming less enjoyable than expected. While this might not bother everyone, we would have preferred a slightly warmer pool given Dubai's otherwise perfect outdoor conditions.\n2.\tSurprisingly, no bread or butter (or even olive oil) was served at the beginning of the meal – a small gesture that we've come to expect in almost every upscale beach club in Dubai. It's not a major issue, of course, but when you're used to a certain standard of hospitality, such details stand out.\n\nOn the positive side, the music was great – not too loud, tasteful, and in tune with the relaxed, upscale vibe of the venue. It created a pleasant background without overpowering the atmosphere.\n\nDespite those two minor points, we had a wonderful day and will definitely return. Nikki Beach Dubai is a sophisticated spot that combines style, great food, and a relaxed yet luxurious vibe. We can highly recommend it to anyone looking for a quality beach club experience in Dubai.",

The calm atmosphere made it feel like we had a private getaway right by the water.\n\nThough 90% of the area feels somewhat abandoned, that added to the charm. It was like exploring a hidden gem with a unique blend of open space, art installations, and beach vibes. The untouched areas make for great photo spots and an enjoyable walk around the site, with views you wouldn't usually find in a busier setting.\n\nOverall, Jumeirah Public Beach in La Mer is perfect for anyone looking for a quieter beach experience and some scenic, off-the-beaten-path exploration.",

Enrich your holiday experience by visiting other beaches in the city. Stop by La Mer Beach, a drive-up spot in Dubai, for beach hangout or check out the JBR beach activities in the city.\n\nIf you fancy driving out of Dubai to a popular beach destination, Dibba Beach in Fujairah could be an excellent choice.",
