The view from the rock, surrounded by the endless sea and with the mainland in the distance, is truly breathtaking. It's a powerful spot where you can reflect and feel deeply connected to nature and Swami Vivekananda's legacy.\n\nHowever, the experience getting there was less than ideal. Despite purchasing the ₹300 ferry ticket, we still had to stand in a long, exhausting queue under the scorching sun, with minimal shade or crowd management. It was quite frustrating, especially considering the premium ticket.\n\nAdditionally, there's a separate entrance fee for the temple once you reach the rock, which felt a bit excessive after already paying for the ferry ride. The heat and waiting time took away from the peacefulness we were hoping for.\n\nTips:\n\nCarry a hat, sunglasses, and water - the sun can be relentless.\nTry to visit early in the morning to avoid both the heat and long queues.\nBe mentally prepared for the wait, even with a higher-priced ticket.\nIt's a must-see spot for its spiritual and scenic value, but a bit of planning (and patience) is necessary to truly enjoy it.",

Once you arrive, be prepared for a wait - even on weekdays, the queue can take around 45 minutes. You can choose between ₹100 or ₹300 tickets depending on your preference, but whichever you choose, the journey is well worth it.\n\nOnce you're there, the calm of the rock, the spiritual energy of the place, the stunning architecture of the memorial, and the majestic Tiruvalluvar statue leave a lasting impression. The glass bridge adds a unique touch to the experience.\n\nNote: There are no food stalls on the premises, so plan your visit after a hearty breakfast or lunch. Free drinking water is available, and there's a small shop where you can buy books and souvenirs to take a part of the experience home.\n\nA must-visit for those seeking serenity, inspiration, and a connection with India's spiritual legacy.",

The statue is located on a small island surrounded by the sea, and now there's a newly built glass sea bridge that connects the Vivekananda Rock Memorial and the Thiruvalluvar Statue. Walking on this bridge was one of the highlights of my trip. You can see the ocean below your feet, and it gives you a thrilling and beautiful view of the surroundings.\n\nThe whole area is very clean and well-maintained. The strong sea breeze made the environment feel fresh and relaxing. It was really peaceful to stand near the statue with the wind blowing and enjoy the sound of the waves all around. The scenery is stunning, especially the view of the three oceans - the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea, and Indian Ocean - meeting at this point.\n\nThe Thiruvalluvar Statue itself is grand and inspiring, honoring one of Tamil Nadu's greatest poets and philosophers. The peaceful surroundings, combined with the majestic statue and the exciting walk on the sea bridge, created a perfect mix of nature, culture, and adventure.\n\nIf you're planning a visit to Kanyakumari, I highly recommend coming early in the morning or near sunset to fully enjoy the view, wind, and light. The sea bridge adds a new dimension to the experience - it's safe, exciting, and offers fantastic photo opportunities.",
