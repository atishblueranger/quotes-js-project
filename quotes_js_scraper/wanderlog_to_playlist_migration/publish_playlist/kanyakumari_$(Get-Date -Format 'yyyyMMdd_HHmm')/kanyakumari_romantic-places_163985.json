The view from the rock, surrounded by the endless sea and with the mainland in the distance, is truly breathtaking. It's a powerful spot where you can reflect and feel deeply connected to nature and Swami Vivekananda's legacy.\n\nHowever, the experience getting there was less than ideal. Despite purchasing the ₹300 ferry ticket, we still had to stand in a long, exhausting queue under the scorching sun, with minimal shade or crowd management. It was quite frustrating, especially considering the premium ticket.\n\nAdditionally, there's a separate entrance fee for the temple once you reach the rock, which felt a bit excessive after already paying for the ferry ride. The heat and waiting time took away from the peacefulness we were hoping for.\n\nTips:\n\nCarry a hat, sunglasses, and water - the sun can be relentless.\nTry to visit early in the morning to avoid both the heat and long queues.\nBe mentally prepared for the wait, even with a higher-priced ticket.\nIt's a must-see spot for its spiritual and scenic value, but a bit of planning (and patience) is necessary to truly enjoy it.",

Once you arrive, be prepared for a wait - even on weekdays, the queue can take around 45 minutes. You can choose between ₹100 or ₹300 tickets depending on your preference, but whichever you choose, the journey is well worth it.\n\nOnce you're there, the calm of the rock, the spiritual energy of the place, the stunning architecture of the memorial, and the majestic Tiruvalluvar statue leave a lasting impression. The glass bridge adds a unique touch to the experience.\n\nNote: There are no food stalls on the premises, so plan your visit after a hearty breakfast or lunch. Free drinking water is available, and there's a small shop where you can buy books and souvenirs to take a part of the experience home.\n\nA must-visit for those seeking serenity, inspiration, and a connection with India's spiritual legacy.",

The statue is located on a small island surrounded by the sea, and now there's a newly built glass sea bridge that connects the Vivekananda Rock Memorial and the Thiruvalluvar Statue. Walking on this bridge was one of the highlights of my trip. You can see the ocean below your feet, and it gives you a thrilling and beautiful view of the surroundings.\n\nThe whole area is very clean and well-maintained. The strong sea breeze made the environment feel fresh and relaxing. It was really peaceful to stand near the statue with the wind blowing and enjoy the sound of the waves all around. The scenery is stunning, especially the view of the three oceans - the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea, and Indian Ocean - meeting at this point.\n\nThe Thiruvalluvar Statue itself is grand and inspiring, honoring one of Tamil Nadu's greatest poets and philosophers. The peaceful surroundings, combined with the majestic statue and the exciting walk on the sea bridge, created a perfect mix of nature, culture, and adventure.\n\nIf you're planning a visit to Kanyakumari, I highly recommend coming early in the morning or near sunset to fully enjoy the view, wind, and light. The sea bridge adds a new dimension to the experience - it's safe, exciting, and offers fantastic photo opportunities.",

Japan chicken was sweet as well but in white gravy. The chicken curry was below average and lollipop was really good. They don't have any particular order while serving, they randomly bring dishes.\n\nDisappointed as wanted to try Prawns and fish but they serve that on selective days I guess.\n\nCourteous staff and fast service.",

The ambiance is warm and inviting, and it's not overly crowded-a perfect setting for a relaxed meal. Prices are quite reasonable compared to other similar establishments, and the service was prompt, with food arriving fairly quickly.\n\nI highly recommend trying the chicken cheese balls; they were delightfully meaty and cheesy. The prawn tempura was enjoyable as well. Overall, a great spot for family dining. Definitely worth a visit!",

The ambiance is relaxed and welcoming, with a nice view that adds to the overall vibe of the place. We ordered a mix of dishes – South Indian vegetarian meal, prawns biryani, mutton curry, and parottas.\n\nThe South Indian veg meal was served with a variety of items, all freshly prepared and flavorful. The prawns biryani was aromatic and well-spiced, with tender prawns and perfectly cooked rice. The mutton curry was rich, spicy, and paired really well with the soft, flaky parottas. Every dish had a homely touch, which we really appreciated.\n\nService was prompt and polite. The staff were courteous and attentive without being intrusive, which made the experience even better. Our food was served hot and without unnecessary delay.\n\nPricing was quite reasonable for the quality and portion size. It's clear that the restaurant focuses on giving a good overall experience rather than just fancy presentation.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our meal here and would definitely recommend Sea View Restaurant for anyone looking for a satisfying family lunch with good food, great service, and a pleasant setting. Will surely visit again.",
