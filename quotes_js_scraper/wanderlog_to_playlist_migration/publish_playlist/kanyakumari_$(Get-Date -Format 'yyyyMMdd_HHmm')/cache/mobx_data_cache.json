The view from the rock, surrounded by the endless sea and with the mainland in the distance, is truly breathtaking. It’s a powerful spot where you can reflect and feel deeply connected to nature and Swami Vivekananda’s legacy.\n\nHowever, the experience getting there was less than ideal. Despite purchasing the ₹300 ferry ticket, we still had to stand in a long, exhausting queue under the scorching sun, with minimal shade or crowd management. It was quite frustrating, especially considering the premium ticket.\n\nAdditionally, there’s a separate entrance fee for the temple once you reach the rock, which felt a bit excessive after already paying for the ferry ride. The heat and waiting time took away from the peacefulness we were hoping for.\n\nTips:\n\nCarry a hat, sunglasses, and water — the sun can be relentless.\nTry to visit early in the morning to avoid both the heat and long queues.\nBe mentally prepared for the wait, even with a higher-priced ticket.\nIt’s a must-see spot for its spiritual and scenic value, but a bit of planning (and patience) is necessary to truly enjoy it."

Once you arrive, be prepared for a wait — even on weekdays, the queue can take around 45 minutes. You can choose between ₹100 or ₹300 tickets depending on your preference, but whichever you choose, the journey is well worth it.\n\nOnce you’re there, the calm of the rock, the spiritual energy of the place, the stunning architecture of the memorial, and the majestic Tiruvalluvar statue leave a lasting impression. The glass bridge adds a unique touch to the experience.\n\nNote: There are no food stalls on the premises, so plan your visit after a hearty breakfast or lunch. Free drinking water is available, and there’s a small shop where you can buy books and souvenirs to take a part of the experience home.\n\nA must-visit for those seeking serenity, inspiration, and a connection with India’s spiritual legacy."

The ferry service will start around 8 AM in the morning and there will be a long fast moving queue for a 100 rs ticket and for a 300 rs ticket the queue will be very less. But the long queue itself will move faster. In a single trip they'll take around 80+ people i guess. So the queue will move fast. 300 rs ticket ppl will have the first priority to board on the ferry but while returning the 300 rs ticket won't work. All 100 and 300 will have to wait in the same queue to board the ferry to return to the mainland."

The statue is located on a small island surrounded by the sea, and now there’s a newly built glass sea bridge that connects the Vivekananda Rock Memorial and the Thiruvalluvar Statue. Walking on this bridge was one of the highlights of my trip. You can see the ocean below your feet, and it gives you a thrilling and beautiful view of the surroundings.\n\nThe whole area is very clean and well-maintained. The strong sea breeze made the environment feel fresh and relaxing. It was really peaceful to stand near the statue with the wind blowing and enjoy the sound of the waves all around. The scenery is stunning, especially the view of the three oceans — the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea, and Indian Ocean — meeting at this point.\n\nThe Thiruvalluvar Statue itself is grand and inspiring, honoring one of Tamil Nadu’s greatest poets and philosophers. The peaceful surroundings, combined with the majestic statue and the exciting walk on the sea bridge, created a perfect mix of nature, culture, and adventure.\n\nIf you're planning a visit to Kanyakumari, I highly recommend coming early in the morning or near sunset to fully enjoy the view, wind, and light. The sea bridge adds a new dimension to the experience — it's safe, exciting, and offers fantastic photo opportunities."

Watching the sunrise and sunset over the ocean from the same spot is a unique and unforgettable experience. The Vivekananda Rock Memorial and Thiruvalluvar Statue are both iconic landmarks worth visiting — peaceful, inspiring, and scenic.\n\nThe confluence of the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Indian Ocean is stunning to witness. The town is clean, the locals are warm and welcoming, and there's a calm spiritual vibe everywhere. Street food is great too, especially the fresh coconut water and local snacks.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking to unwind, explore Indian culture, or just enjoy coastal beauty. I'd definitely love to return!"

Standing tall at 133 feet, this majestic statue honors the legendary Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, who gifted us the timeless Thirukkural.\nThe view of the endless ocean all around adds to the peaceful yet powerful atmosphere. It's not just a monument—it's a symbol of ancient wisdom, Tamil pride, and universal values."

Standing tall against the backdrop of the ocean, the statue looks so majestic and inspiring—it almost feels like it’s watching over the waves with wisdom. The boat ride to reach the statue added to the excitement, and once there, I was amazed by the sheer size and detailed craftsmanship. Being up close made me appreciate not just the beauty but also the cultural importance behind it. The only small drawback was the crowd and a bit of waiting time, but once you’re there, it’s worth it. It’s a place that makes you pause, reflect, and feel proud of such heritage. 🌊🙏"

Separate building for Vivekanandha rock memorial Hall. Here you can sit and do meditation. Glass bridge is to reach Thiruvalluvar statue is the one of the amazing experience  we can ever had. Very thrilling experience. You can take videos when you are walking on the glass bridge. It’s looks like we are walking on the water. If you reach close to Thiruvalluvar statue it’s difficult to take photo near the statue because of the height of the statue photo won’t cover the full statue. But entrance itself you can see the front view of the Thiruvalllivar statue."

Cannot find  a clean public comfort station, expanded parking facility, water kiosks, waiting areas etc. Instead can experience severe extortion of tourist by locals. Car owners have to pay at check post and parking area simultaneously for touring along beach side. Parking big problem as we have to bribe for allowing parking in private places and streets. The most popular rock structured shrine kanyakumari devi temple is found kept in a dilapidated state without proper access and affairs inside mismanaged. The vivekananda rock, thiruvalluvar statue, glass bridge, laser shows, tirupati temple, sucheendram temple, kumarakovil temple, onshore mupanthal windmill, thovala flower cultivations etc are some of the places to visit here. Hotels and restaurants found unhygienic without food safety inspections. Renovated ttdc somewhat good for food and stay. Street vendors occupying public spaces in an inconsiderate manner is affecting the beauty and charm and ambience of kanyakumari. Just projecting sun rise and sun set can't do with tourism  alone. Establishing world class activities and amenities is the need of the hour for keeping kanyakumari into a world class travel destination as the new highway is going to pave way for good access."

The pictures shared shows the condition of the view points. It’s evident that there is no proper maintenance. The Kanyakumari panchayat have increased the entrance ticket charge from 50/- to 100/- and also they are charging additional parking fees. Inspite of collecting these amounts, The Authorities do not provide adequate facilities for tourists. The street sellers are taking advantage and charging more than the required amount for supplies. These suggestions are made so that some improvements will be provided by the Authorities. Whatsoever Kanyakumari is one of the best beaches in Soya India❤️"

The natural beauty of the location creates a perfect moment of reflection and stillness.\n\nHowever, visitors should tread carefully – the path is made of irregular stone boulders, which can be uneven and tricky to walk on, especially in low light. Comfortable footwear and caution are a must.\n\nWe plan to return tomorrow morning to witness the sunrise from this tranquil spot — we’ve heard it’s a magical sight not to be missed."

It is recommended to arrive around 5:30 PM so that you can find a good spot before the place gets crowded.\n\nOne pro tip: if you are taking a time-lapse of the sunrise or sunset, keep the FPS at least 120x to clearly capture the movement of the sun. I have attached the sunset timelapse taken at 60x.\n\nAfter enjoying the sunset, don’t miss trying banana bhajji while watching the ocean."

The vast ocean stretching endlessly, with waves crashing against the pier, creates a mesmerizing view. It’s a great place to take a peaceful walk, enjoy the sea breeze, and soak in the panoramic sights.\n\nSunrise and sunset here are absolutely magical, with the sky painted in vibrant hues. You can also see fishing boats in the distance, adding to the charm of the place. The pier is not very crowded, making it a perfect spot for photography and quiet reflection.\n\nIf you’re visiting Kanyakumari, this place is a must-visit for its serene and scenic vibe!"

The breeze is refreshing, but at times, it can be quite powerful, making it important to hold onto your belongings and stay cautious while enjoying the breathtaking views"

Goes as far into the sea as to be side by side with the Swami Vivekananda Rock. Offers nice view of the Swami Vivekananda Memorial, glass bridge, Thiruvalluvar Statue, and the eastern coast line of the town. Makes a nice spot to watch the sun rise. Not ideal for the elderly to walk on. I wouldn't strongly recommend taking children here."

Too many people will visit in the morning so try to reach out early. You can see the beautiful vivekananda memorial from here. Please see the weather forecast and then only visit because cloudy mornings can spoil your experience.\n\nNote: It's too hot in Kanyakumari on normal days so please make the arrangements accordingly because skin burn will occur."

Cannot find  a clean public comfort station, expanded parking facility, water kiosks, waiting areas etc. Instead can experience severe extortion of tourist by locals. Car owners have to pay at check post and parking area simultaneously for touring along beach side. Parking big problem as we have to bribe for allowing parking in private places and streets. The most popular rock structured shrine kanyakumari devi temple is found kept in a dilapidated state without proper access and affairs inside mismanaged. The vivekananda rock, thiruvalluvar statue, glass bridge, laser shows, tirupati temple, sucheendram temple, kumarakovil temple, onshore mupanthal windmill, thovala flower cultivations etc are some of the places to visit here. Hotels and restaurants found unhygienic without food safety inspections. Renovated ttdc somewhat good for food and stay. Street vendors occupying public spaces in an inconsiderate manner is affecting the beauty and charm and ambience of kanyakumari. Just projecting sun rise and sun set can't do with tourism  alone. Establishing world class activities and amenities is the need of the hour for keeping kanyakumari into a world class travel destination as the new highway is going to pave way for good access."

              "reviewText": "Vivekananda Rock Memorial – Beautiful, But Be Prepared\n\nThe Vivekananda Rock Memorial is undoubtedly a serene and inspiring place, rich in history and spiritual significance. The view from the rock, surrounded by the endless sea and with the mainland in the distance, is truly breathtaking. It’s a powerful spot where you can reflect and feel deeply connected to nature and Swami Vivekananda’s legacy.\n\nHowever, the experience getting there was less than ideal. Despite purchasing the ₹300 ferry ticket, we still had to stand in a long, exhausting queue under the scorching sun, with minimal shade or crowd management. It was quite frustrating, especially considering the premium ticket.\n\nAdditionally, there’s a separate entrance fee for the temple once you reach the rock, which felt a bit excessive after already paying for the ferry ride. The heat and waiting time took away from the peacefulness we were hoping for.\n\nTips:\n\nCarry a hat, sunglasses, and water — the sun can be relentless.\nTry to visit early in the morning to avoid both the heat and long queues.\nBe mentally prepared for the wait, even with a higher-priced ticket.\nIt’s a must-see spot for its spiritual and scenic value, but a bit of planning (and patience) is necessary to truly enjoy it."

Once you arrive, be prepared for a wait — even on weekdays, the queue can take around 45 minutes. You can choose between ₹100 or ₹300 tickets depending on your preference, but whichever you choose, the journey is well worth it.\n\nOnce you’re there, the calm of the rock, the spiritual energy of the place, the stunning architecture of the memorial, and the majestic Tiruvalluvar statue leave a lasting impression. The glass bridge adds a unique touch to the experience.\n\nNote: There are no food stalls on the premises, so plan your visit after a hearty breakfast or lunch. Free drinking water is available, and there’s a small shop where you can buy books and souvenirs to take a part of the experience home.\n\nA must-visit for those seeking serenity, inspiration, and a connection with India’s spiritual legacy."

The ferry service will start around 8 AM in the morning and there will be a long fast moving queue for a 100 rs ticket and for a 300 rs ticket the queue will be very less. But the long queue itself will move faster. In a single trip they'll take around 80+ people i guess. So the queue will move fast. 300 rs ticket ppl will have the first priority to board on the ferry but while returning the 300 rs ticket won't work. All 100 and 300 will have to wait in the same queue to board the ferry to return to the mainland."

              "reviewText": "I recently visited the Thiruvalluvar Statue in Kanyakumari, and it was an unforgettable experience. The statue is located on a small island surrounded by the sea, and now there’s a newly built glass sea bridge that connects the Vivekananda Rock Memorial and the Thiruvalluvar Statue. Walking on this bridge was one of the highlights of my trip. You can see the ocean below your feet, and it gives you a thrilling and beautiful view of the surroundings.\n\nThe whole area is very clean and well-maintained. The strong sea breeze made the environment feel fresh and relaxing. It was really peaceful to stand near the statue with the wind blowing and enjoy the sound of the waves all around. The scenery is stunning, especially the view of the three oceans — the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea, and Indian Ocean — meeting at this point.\n\nThe Thiruvalluvar Statue itself is grand and inspiring, honoring one of Tamil Nadu’s greatest poets and philosophers. The peaceful surroundings, combined with the majestic statue and the exciting walk on the sea bridge, created a perfect mix of nature, culture, and adventure.\n\nIf you're planning a visit to Kanyakumari, I highly recommend coming early in the morning or near sunset to fully enjoy the view, wind, and light. The sea bridge adds a new dimension to the experience — it's safe, exciting, and offers fantastic photo opportunities."

There is glass bridge connecting between the statue and the meditation centre which is also an attraction."

Watching the sunrise and sunset over the ocean from the same spot is a unique and unforgettable experience. The Vivekananda Rock Memorial and Thiruvalluvar Statue are both iconic landmarks worth visiting — peaceful, inspiring, and scenic.\n\nThe confluence of the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Indian Ocean is stunning to witness. The town is clean, the locals are warm and welcoming, and there's a calm spiritual vibe everywhere. Street food is great too, especially the fresh coconut water and local snacks.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking to unwind, explore Indian culture, or just enjoy coastal beauty. I'd definitely love to return!"

Standing tall against the backdrop of the ocean, the statue looks so majestic and inspiring—it almost feels like it’s watching over the waves with wisdom. The boat ride to reach the statue added to the excitement, and once there, I was amazed by the sheer size and detailed craftsmanship. Being up close made me appreciate not just the beauty but also the cultural importance behind it. The only small drawback was the crowd and a bit of waiting time, but once you’re there, it’s worth it. It’s a place that makes you pause, reflect, and feel proud of such heritage. 🌊🙏"

Very thrilling experience. You can take videos when you are walking on the glass bridge. It’s looks like we are walking on the water. If you reach close to Thiruvalluvar statue it’s difficult to take photo near the statue because of the height of the statue photo won’t cover the full statue. But entrance itself you can see the front view of the Thiruvalllivar statue."

As we approached the mandapam, we became increasingly cautious, especially when we noticed a man lurking nearby, persistently asking for money. This unexpected encounter was frustrating, as we were unaware of his intentions before stepping inside. It felt as though we had been caught in a trap, and ultimately, he managed to take 200 rupees from us. It left us with a bitter experience, wishing we had been informed beforehand about this practice."

Kamaraj, a revered freedom fighter and former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. Known as the \"Black Gandhi\" and \"Perunthalaivar,\" Kamaraj was instrumental in introducing the free midday meal scheme in schools in 1962, encouraging education among the underprivileged.\n\nThe memorial is situated near the Triveni Sangam, adjacent to the Gandhi Mandapam, offering visitors a chance to explore multiple historical sites in close proximity.  Inside, the photographic exhibits provide a comprehensive overview of Kamaraj's life, his contributions to India's political landscape, and his dedication to public service.\n\nThe architecture of the mandapam is notable, blending traditional Dravidian elements with contemporary design, reminiscent of a gopuram found in South Indian temples.  The serene ambiance of the memorial offers a space for reflection on the enduring legacy of a leader who prioritized education and social welfare.\n\nOverall, the Kamarajar Mani Mandapam stands as a significant landmark in Kanyakumari, honoring a leader whose vision and efforts have left a lasting impact on Tamil Nadu and India as a whole."

The hotel is conveniently located near Parvati Mata Temple and Vivekananda Rock Memorial, both within walking distance.\nWe booked a sea-facing room, which offered a breathtaking view, especially in the morning. The hotel staff was exceptional, always courteous and ready to assist. A special mention to Mani Sir, who was always happy to help, along with the rest of the team.\nFor food, we initially tried Saravana, but it didn’t meet our expectations. Eventually, we ended up having all our meals at Sea View Hotel, where the food was delicious, and the service was excellent. I highly recommend both the stay and dining experience at Sea View Hotel for anyone visiting Kanyakumari."

His behavior alone was enough to ruin the stay.\n\nThe food served was below average and nowhere near the quality advertised. To top it all off, my father's earphones, which were accidentally left in the room, were stolen.\n\nThe entire experience was traumatizing, and I would strongly warn others to stay away.

The staff at the hotel we're very friendly and helpful and we enjoyed our stay there. Our room was quite good, a little old but clean. The aircon sort of worked but we needed the fan on as well to keep the room at a sensible temperature. We ate at the hotel and really enjoyed the food plus the friendly service. We didn't use the pool but it looked very good. Overall, a good stay in a good location"

They kept insisting on 10AM as the checkout time even though I told them I have to leave early in the morning itself. Not sure why this push. At the breakfast and dinner which I had from their restaurant the staff weren't very interested in helping you. 3-4 of them stood in a corner and were chatting. I would recommend to step out and have your meals if you have the transport options because the price is not worth it at all.\n\nOverall the location is great and rooms are decent but service is bad."

Hence the charm in checking into the hotel which is quite pricey , is lost. We had to literally beg for a room with a sea view to which they finally obliged. Moreover this cannot be called a resort since the property is not very big except for the landscaped garden in front .And the amenities available in a resort are lacking in the rooms and especially the bathrooms which are quite small and moderate unlike the ones seen in good resorts. They have to definitely improve on it to rise to the level of a resort.\nThe redeeming factor is the proximity to the sea and sun rise and sun set view points which is just a walking distance away. Good for a one day stay"

The Kanyakumari panchayat have increased the entrance ticket charge from 50/- to 100/- and also they are charging additional parking fees. Inspite of collecting these amounts, The Authorities do not provide adequate facilities for tourists. The street sellers are taking advantage and charging more than the required amount for supplies.

The reception staff needs to be little polite though, while checking out the room, they were really rude and didn’t speak well.

When we returned on the last day we were asked about 10km to go shopping in Kanyakumari (there is still a lot of km left to meet the minimum requirement) he first thought to take us to his favorite shop. He refused to go to his shop and was very reluctant to take us there. He started to say that I had taken the alternative booking (before our booking time). She persuaded him and took him to the shop he wanted. He later apologized for his behavior. 95% of the time, the driver was very good and if we ignore his last mistake / accept his apology, he has 100% recommendation.

But you can stand at the shore and feel the cool waves rub your feet. You can play with sand. There are a couple of shops for refreshments. If you want to reach by bus you can board Pallam bus (bus no.36A) or Ambalapathy bus from Anna Bus Stand, Nagercoil (Nagercoil Town Bus Stand) and get down at Osaravilai which is around 10kms from Anna Bus Stand. From osaravilai you can walk down to the beach which is less than 1km from osaravilai."

This beach consistently impresses with its pristine white sand and crystal-clear turquoise waters, creating a postcard-perfect setting. It's my go-to spot for a relaxing and enjoyable day by the sea.\n\nMy family and I love spending long hours here, wandering along the shoreline, collecting seashells, and playing catch or Frisbee on some days. We particularly enjoy the tranquil atmosphere away from the main beach, which tends to get crowded in the evenings.\n\nThe beach offers ample space for outdoor activities, making it perfect for a day out with loved ones. Whether you're seeking serenity or some fun in the sun, this beach has it all. Highly recommended for anyone looking to unwind and connect with nature."

But thesea is not safe to play on the sea. The waves are very unpredictable and the sea in this area has an undercurrent which is fatal. So be cautious and stay away from the waves. Enjoy the breeze the water and sunrise sunset safely away from the sea.\nLocal govt needs to keep more waste collection boxes so that people can drop it there or advise the sellers to bring there own waste boxes to collect and dispose it safely.\nOne among the many beaches that is available in Kanyakumari district.Enjoy from distance and it's worth it."

From the moment you arrive, you're greeted by an atmosphere of serene beauty that instantly melts away any stress.\nWhat truly sets Sangudhurai apart is its pristine and untouched nature. Unlike many overcrowded beaches, Sangudhurai offers ample space to relax, stroll, and simply soak in the breathtaking surroundings. The sand is soft and golden, perfect for leisurely walks, and the clear turquoise waters are incredibly inviting for a refreshing dip.\nThe natural beauty here is simply stunning. The gentle waves lapping against the shore create a soothing soundtrack, and the picturesque views of the coastline are mesmerizing, especially during sunrise or sunset – a photographer's dream! It's a place where you can genuinely connect with nature and find a sense of peace.\nWhile it retains its natural charm, there are just enough amenities (like small local vendors for refreshments) to make your visit comfortable without disrupting the tranquility. The locals are also incredibly friendly and welcoming, adding to the overall positive experience.\nWhether you're looking for a peaceful escape, a romantic stroll, or a family outing, Sangudhurai Beach delivers beyond expectations. It's a true hidden gem that deserves all five stars and more. I cannot recommend it highly enough – do yourself a favor and experience the magic of Sangudhurai!"

Will not recommend swimming in the sea water but can really enjoy in the shore and in water avoid going deep inside. This is a place i used to visit from my child hood times and i normally go there alone sit peacefully and listen to ilayaraja music that’s a meditation."

It’s clean, less crowded, and offers a calm atmosphere compared to other busy beaches. The sunset view is absolutely stunning – a must-see if you're visiting in the evening!\n\nSwimming or playing in the sea is not allowed due to the steep slope and strong currents, but you can still enjoy a peaceful time walking along the shore, taking photos, and enjoying the cool breeze. There are also coconut trees and scenic spots around that make it ideal for a picnic or short visit.\n\nHighly recommended for a quiet family outing or sunset experience!"

The view from the rock, surrounded by the endless sea and with the mainland in the distance, is truly breathtaking. It’s a powerful spot where you can reflect and feel deeply connected to nature and Swami Vivekananda’s legacy.\n\nHowever, the experience getting there was less than ideal. Despite purchasing the ₹300 ferry ticket, we still had to stand in a long, exhausting queue under the scorching sun, with minimal shade or crowd management. It was quite frustrating, especially considering the premium ticket.\n\nAdditionally, there’s a separate entrance fee for the temple once you reach the rock, which felt a bit excessive after already paying for the ferry ride. The heat and waiting time took away from the peacefulness we were hoping for.\n\nTips:\n\nCarry a hat, sunglasses, and water — the sun can be relentless.\nTry to visit early in the morning to avoid both the heat and long queues.\nBe mentally prepared for the wait, even with a higher-priced ticket.\nIt’s a must-see spot for its spiritual and scenic value, but a bit of planning (and patience) is necessary to truly enjoy it."

Once you arrive, be prepared for a wait — even on weekdays, the queue can take around 45 minutes. You can choose between ₹100 or ₹300 tickets depending on your preference, but whichever you choose, the journey is well worth it.\n\nOnce you’re there, the calm of the rock, the spiritual energy of the place, the stunning architecture of the memorial, and the majestic Tiruvalluvar statue leave a lasting impression. The glass bridge adds a unique touch to the experience.\n\nNote: There are no food stalls on the premises, so plan your visit after a hearty breakfast or lunch. Free drinking water is available, and there’s a small shop where you can buy books and souvenirs to take a part of the experience home.\n\nA must-visit for those seeking serenity, inspiration, and a connection with India’s spiritual legacy."

The ferry service will start around 8 AM in the morning and there will be a long fast moving queue for a 100 rs ticket and for a 300 rs ticket the queue will be very less. But the long queue itself will move faster. In a single trip they'll take around 80+ people i guess. So the queue will move fast. 300 rs ticket ppl will have the first priority to board on the ferry but while returning the 300 rs ticket won't work. All 100 and 300 will have to wait in the same queue to board the ferry to return to the mainland."

The statue is located on a small island surrounded by the sea, and now there’s a newly built glass sea bridge that connects the Vivekananda Rock Memorial and the Thiruvalluvar Statue. Walking on this bridge was one of the highlights of my trip. You can see the ocean below your feet, and it gives you a thrilling and beautiful view of the surroundings.\n\nThe whole area is very clean and well-maintained. The strong sea breeze made the environment feel fresh and relaxing. It was really peaceful to stand near the statue with the wind blowing and enjoy the sound of the waves all around. The scenery is stunning, especially the view of the three oceans — the Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea, and Indian Ocean — meeting at this point.\n\nThe Thiruvalluvar Statue itself is grand and inspiring, honoring one of Tamil Nadu’s greatest poets and philosophers. The peaceful surroundings, combined with the majestic statue and the exciting walk on the sea bridge, created a perfect mix of nature, culture, and adventure.\n\nIf you're planning a visit to Kanyakumari, I highly recommend coming early in the morning or near sunset to fully enjoy the view, wind, and light. The sea bridge adds a new dimension to the experience — it's safe, exciting, and offers fantastic photo opportunities."

Street food is great too, especially the fresh coconut water and local snacks.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking to unwind, explore Indian culture, or just enjoy coastal beauty.

Being up close made me appreciate not just the beauty but also the cultural importance behind it. The only small drawback was the crowd and a bit of waiting time, but once you’re there, it’s worth it. It’s a place that makes you pause, reflect, and feel proud of such heritage. 🌊🙏"

Separate building for Vivekanandha rock memorial Hall. Here you can sit and do meditation. Glass bridge is to reach Thiruvalluvar statue is the one of the amazing experience  we can ever had. Very thrilling experience. You can take videos when you are walking on the glass bridge. It’s looks like we are walking on the water. If you reach close to Thiruvalluvar statue it’s difficult to take photo near the statue because of the height of the statue photo won’t cover the full statue. But entrance itself you can see the front view of the Thiruvalllivar statue."

Cannot find  a clean public comfort station, expanded parking facility, water kiosks, waiting areas etc. Instead can experience severe extortion of tourist by locals. Car owners have to pay at check post and parking area simultaneously for touring along beach side. Parking big problem as we have to bribe for allowing parking in private places and streets. The most popular rock structured shrine kanyakumari devi temple is found kept in a dilapidated state without proper access and affairs inside mismanaged. The vivekananda rock, thiruvalluvar statue, glass bridge, laser shows, tirupati temple, sucheendram temple, kumarakovil temple, onshore mupanthal windmill, thovala flower cultivations etc are some of the places to visit here. Hotels and restaurants found unhygienic without food safety inspections. Renovated ttdc somewhat good for food and stay. Street vendors occupying public spaces in an inconsiderate manner is affecting the beauty and charm and ambience of kanyakumari. Just projecting sun rise and sun set can't do with tourism  alone. Establishing world class activities and amenities is the need of the hour for keeping kanyakumari into a world class travel destination as the new highway is going to pave way for good access."

Inside, the photographic exhibits provide a comprehensive overview of Kamaraj's life, his contributions to India's political landscape, and his dedication to public service.\n\nThe architecture of the mandapam is notable, blending traditional Dravidian elements with contemporary design, reminiscent of a gopuram found in South Indian temples.

The water consists of tonnes of dirt and lacks attractiveness. Least crowded except when there are kids from nearby schoold visits during excursions. Lot of strees with loads of birdshit waiting for your heads and shoulders if you are sitting in tree shadow. Poor quality costumes can be bought at high quality prices for water activities. A ride in the small toy trai will test the strength of your bones. A wave pool is there mostly works like a garbage pool due to gallons of muck. Overall, an avoidable outing."

Half of the dry rides not working or maintenance required.\n\nWater rides switched on for 5 minutes. If you ask them for service they don't even bother to answer after purchasing the ticket. Don't eat inside the restaurant. The bumping car was allowed only for 3 minutes and re entry not allowed wow and 600/- is a ticket price. 9D movie was a flop for which they are charging 120/- bucks for one movie around 4-5 minutes.\n\nWater quality was so bad me and my son got skin rashes. They are not changing and cleaning the water regularly. The best cheat part was after all this they have lunch break for their rides which was 1 pm to 2 pm.\n\nBefore entering I have requested them may I see the place first they told straight no. No one should visit this place in there dream also.\n\nChef BB"

The tariff are very high comparing to service. So I am disappointed about Baywatch . In this theme park where you can spend 3-4 hours for 15-20 rides. There is not so crowded and you don't have to wait for turns for the rides. The water rides are good, especially the Family and Kids pool. Water quality is good. The Wave Pool is small but enjoyable. Scenic view is excellent from this road. A awesome sunset in Kanyakumari. One of finest place to view sun set as per the opinion of my friends. Food and street shopping also great. The place is well maintained and offers a fantastic panoramic view of the setting sun along with ocean. They could have added more rides for children. If you don't want to watch 9D cinema tell them before buying your tickets."

The entry fee is rupees 600 per adult and 500 per kids taller than 90cms height. It has 3- 4 water pools for kids that are very safe due to their depth but dirty due to poor cleanup. The water consists of tonnes of dirt and lacks attractiveness. Least crowded except when there are kids from nearby schoold visits during excursions. Lot of strees with loads of birdshit waiting for your heads and shoulders if you are sitting in tree shadow. Poor quality costumes can be bought at high quality prices for water activities. A ride in the small toy trai will test the strength of your bones. A wave pool is there mostly works like a garbage pool due to gallons of muck. Overall, an avoidable outing."

As the last accessible point of the Indian mainland, it offers a peaceful ambiance and stunning views that make the experience unforgettable.\n\nWe visited the place in the evening and were captivated by the calm surroundings and the gentle sound of the waves. The natural beauty of the location creates a perfect moment of reflection and stillness.\n\nHowever, visitors should tread carefully – the path is made of irregular stone boulders, which can be uneven and tricky to walk on, especially in low light. Comfortable footwear and caution are a must.\n\nWe plan to return tomorrow morning to witness the sunrise from this tranquil spot — we’ve heard it’s a magical sight not to be missed."

Prices are quite reasonable compared to other similar establishments, and the service was prompt, with food arriving fairly quickly.\n\nI highly recommend trying the chicken cheese balls; they were delightfully meaty and cheesy. The prawn tempura was enjoyable as well. Overall, a great spot for family dining. Definitely worth a visit!"

The ambiance is relaxed and welcoming, with a nice view that adds to the overall vibe of the place. We ordered a mix of dishes – South Indian vegetarian meal, prawns biryani, mutton curry, and parottas.\n\nThe South Indian veg meal was served with a variety of items, all freshly prepared and flavorful. The prawns biryani was aromatic and well-spiced, with tender prawns and perfectly cooked rice. The mutton curry was rich, spicy, and paired really well with the soft, flaky parottas. Every dish had a homely touch, which we really appreciated.\n\nService was prompt and polite. The staff were courteous and attentive without being intrusive, which made the experience even better. Our food was served hot and without unnecessary delay.\n\nPricing was quite reasonable for the quality and portion size. It’s clear that the restaurant focuses on giving a good overall experience rather than just fancy presentation.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our meal here and would definitely recommend Sea View Restaurant for anyone looking for a satisfying family lunch with good food, great service, and a pleasant setting. Will surely visit again."

I ordered two parotas which cost Rs. 75, served with a tiny bowl of curry that was watery and tasteless. Definitely not worth the price.\n\nWhat’s worse is the pricing for beverages—tea is charged between Rs. 30 to 60, but there’s absolutely no justification for it. It’s not about the quantity, but the quality and taste, which are both missing.\n\nOverall, I would not recommend Hotel Triveni, especially considering their high charges for such substandard food and service."

No proper communication from staff, they blame it on management. Food was not even average. We order one piece of Kingfish and what we got was a small portion which will not be enough for a kid and the cost was 450 plus tax. Overhyped placed due to social media. I think these are paid promotions across insta or FB. Not worth really. Please think 3 times before going and blowing up your travel expenses for rusty food."

Japan chicken was sweet as well but in white gravy. The chicken curry was below average and lollipop was really good. They don't have any particular order while serving, they randomly bring dishes.\n\nDisappointed as wanted to try Prawns and fish but they serve that on selective days I guess.\n\nCourteous staff and fast service."

The area offers a diverse range of food options including Chaatwala, Beach Cafe, Coffee Shop, and Seafood.\nMy favorite spot was the Coffee Shop where I enjoyed a cup of their premium filter coffee – it was truly exceptional.\nThe ambiance of the food court is fantastic, with well-placed lights creating a welcoming and vibrant atmosphere.\nWalking around and exploring the different counters was a pleasure, especially with the cool sea breeze adding to the charm. Seashore Food Court is a great place to relax and enjoy a variety of delicious food in a beautiful setting in the evening."

A row of palm tree along the beach, with a few shade huts, provide good protection from sun, making this a perfect place to watch sunset\n\nPlace has ample parking for around 10 cars, but road is also empty, so more cars can be parked on road"

But you can stand at the shore and feel the cool waves rub your feet. You can play with sand. There are a couple of shops for refreshments. If you want to reach by bus you can board Pallam bus (bus no.36A) or Ambalapathy bus from Anna Bus Stand, Nagercoil (Nagercoil Town Bus Stand) and get down at Osaravilai which is around 10kms from Anna Bus Stand. From osaravilai you can walk down to the beach which is less than 1km from osaravilai."

This beach consistently impresses with its pristine white sand and crystal-clear turquoise waters, creating a postcard-perfect setting. It's my go-to spot for a relaxing and enjoyable day by the sea.\n\nMy family and I love spending long hours here, wandering along the shoreline, collecting seashells, and playing catch or Frisbee on some days. We particularly enjoy the tranquil atmosphere away from the main beach, which tends to get crowded in the evenings.\n\nThe beach offers ample space for outdoor activities, making it perfect for a day out with loved ones. Whether you're seeking serenity or some fun in the sun, this beach has it all. Highly recommended for anyone looking to unwind and connect with nature."

But thesea is not safe to play on the sea. The waves are very unpredictable and the sea in this area has an undercurrent which is fatal. So be cautious and stay away from the waves. Enjoy the breeze the water and sunrise sunset safely away from the sea.\nLocal govt needs to keep more waste collection boxes so that people can drop it there or advise the sellers to bring there own waste boxes to collect and dispose it safely.\nOne among the many beaches that is available in Kanyakumari district.Enjoy from distance and it's worth it."

The approach to the waters isn't pristine but it's not garbage either - just driftwood and things washed up from the ocean. You can catch some great sunsets from this beach. It's a good place to also wet your feet. My little son loves this \"beachy\" so much!"
