From the moment you step in, you're transported into a winter wonderland with real snow, icy slides, and loads of fun activities. The temperature drops instantly, and it's a refreshing change from the Chennai heat!\n\nThey provide all the necessary winter gear like jackets, boots, and gloves, which are clean and well-maintained. The snow play area is spacious and perfect for families, kids, and even groups of friends. The music, lighting, and overall vibe make it a joyful experience.\n\nThe highlight for me was the snow slide and the snowfall simulation – truly magical moments. Staff were polite, safety measures were in place, and everything was well organized.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a fun, chilly adventure without leaving the city. Perfect weekend getaway or birthday surprise idea too!",

Unlike many of the more crowded and commercialized beaches in the city, this beach stands out for its good hygiene and well-maintained surroundings.\n\nThe ambiance is particularly pleasant - peaceful and scenic, especially after 7 PM when the crowd thins out and the entire place takes on a calming, almost meditative vibe. It's a great spot for anyone looking to unwind, reflect, or just enjoy the gentle sea breeze without much noise or chaos.\n\nOne of the biggest highlights is the sense of safety here. Even at night, the beach is safe to visit, thanks to the regular police presence.Thuruvanmiyur beach offers a cleaner, quieter, and more peaceful alternative to the usual Chennai beaches. Whether you're a local or a tourist, it's definitely worth adding to your list.",

The overall experience was enjoyable, and the place is well-maintained.\n\nHowever, since April is quite hot, the walking paths get really exhausting due to the high temperatures. It would be great if more trees and shaded plant areas are added along the way to give some relief from the sun.\n\nOne concern I noticed was a deer that had escaped its enclosure and was eating human-discarded food. While it was surprising to see, it also shows the need for better monitoring and care in the deer section to avoid any risks to the animals or visitors.\n\nOn the positive side, they support both cash and QR code payments, which is very convenient in this digital age. But one important suggestion: there was no clear notice or signage informing visitors that online payment can be done directly through a QR code without standing in the ticket queue. I waited in a long queue only to be told at the counter to scan and book online via WhatsApp chatbot. This needs to be highlighted with proper boards at the entrance to save visitors' time.\n\nDespite these small issues, the zoo offers a rich and diverse experience and is definitely worth visiting. A few improvements can make it even better!",

The outdoor seating area feels like a secret garden, perfect for relaxation. The food is exceptional, with standout pizzas, delicious chicken dishes, and mouthwatering desserts. But the real highlight for me was the abundance of friendly cats roaming around - a cat lover's paradise! Definitely worth visiting again and again for the outdoor seating, food, and feline friends!\"",

It's located in the heart of the city but the whole area is covered with trees and plants and makes you feel you're somewhere way out of the city.\n\nComing to the food, we ordered one Pesto Fusili pasta with potato and beans and omlette along with iced cappuccinos. Everything were delicious and filling. They have cocktails on the menu as well along with a bakery with a lot of cakes and pastry options.\nOverall a great experience but we felt the price is a bit on the higher side.

It's a great place for pictures or just to chill for a while.\n\nBut the food and service were a huge letdown.\nWe ordered cold coffee, hazelnut cappuccino, and chicken pizza – none of them were good.\nCold coffee tasted like diluted water, not even cold. The cappuccino had too much froth and lacked flavour. And the pizza? The chicken felt undercooked and totally off.\n\nOn top of that, it's super expensive, and we literally spent 20 minutes just trying to figure out the menu – nothing was clear and the waiter wasn't helpful.\n\nMight visit again just for the peaceful vibe, but definitely not for the food.",

Our recent visit left us thoroughly impressed, and it's safe to say that this place offers more than just a meal-it delivers an experience.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped in, the setting was nothing short of magical. The soft glow of lights, the rustic yet elegant decor, and the soothing blend of nature with modern comforts set the perfect tone for an unforgettable evening. As luck would have it, the weather played along, with a gentle drizzle adding a poetic touch to our dinner. Opting for outdoor seating under a closed roof, we found ourselves immersed in the rhythmic sounds of the rain-a serene backdrop for the feast that was about to unfold.\n\nThe culinary journey began with piping-hot soups, rich in flavor and crafted to perfection. Each course seamlessly followed, delivering a delightful blend of taste and texture that kept us wanting more. The main course was indulgent yet refined, celebrating fresh ingredients and masterful preparation. And then came the grand finale-dessert. Every bite was heavenly, a perfect ending to an extraordinary meal.\n\nBut what truly set the evening apart was the atmosphere. Dining while watching an intense IPL match, with the sound of rain complementing the cheers and celebrations, was an experience like no other. It was a beautiful contrast-comforting food, a lively game, and nature's gentle embrace, all blending effortlessly into one unforgettable night.\n\nEast Coast at Madras Square is a place where food meets artistry and ambience enhances every flavor. Whether you're looking for a quiet evening or a lively gathering, this restaurant promises an experience worth cherishing. Highly recommended!",

I visited with my cousins, who love non-veg food, and they absolutely enjoyed it. As a vegetarian, I was happy to see a good selection of dishes for us as well. Their Thali is perfect for sharing between two people. The unique display of starters before ordering is a great touch, making it easier to choose what to try. Definitely a place worth visiting!",

The parking space is enough to accommodate 2-3 cars, and few bikes at a time.\n\nThe ambience is pleasing and is spacious enough to easily accommodate 50 persons at a time.\n\nThis cafe offers a wide variety of dishes to choose from. And most of them are quite new fused dishes that are hard to find in many other cafes in this city. The time taken to serve the dishes was quite slow, but it is perfect when we either go as a couple (Date) or for a business meeting.\n\nThe taste of most of the dishes were close to perfect and the quantity seemed good for the rates offered. I would highly recommend trying their soups and starters.\n\nA perfect cafe in the city for a date.",

The service is pathetically slow and the waiter not speaking English and being clueless about what we just said doesn't help either. There's a lack of waiters so you can't even inquire about your order if you need to.\n\nWe waited 1 hour for two pathetic mocktails that weren't even good. One starter arrived quickly and one dish took 40mins and the other 50mins (in total). Such slow service despite only less than 8 guests at the place. Every single time we told the waiter one thing, he left somewhere on a scooter and took a long time to come back???\n\nIt seems there is a lack of proper organisation and management at this place.\n\nWhich is a shame because the ambience is actually good and the area is peaceful and clean, with ample parking on the street. It's a nice place to relax. I do wish the table and curtains were clean cause they looked dirty. It's not that difficult to wash them…\n\nThe food was fine. Nothing to write home about. Pretty average all in all. Half the menu wasn't available for some reason so our choices were limited.\n\nI would not recommend visiting this place. There are definitely better places in ECR.",

Ground floor has women's boutique and first floor has a men's wear section, women's jewellery and cafe. The cafe itself has two partitions. One with beautiful chairs and meant for a date brunch or casual meetings. The second section is more cozy with books lined on shelves and cushioned chairs and sofas. Pick any book you like, read for how ever long you want. Their selection of breakfasts and coffees are definitely worth more visits. Hosts and servers are friendly and helpful with any queries about the menu. The waiting time is fairy short in the mornings but lunch rush will have you waiting for at least twenty minutes. But it's worth all the waiting.\nDefinitely hungry to try more dishes!",

I have a very mixed opinion in food, yes it is overpriced and veg pizza was way too cheesy, sea food pizza was too bland. Only the arabiata pastas were enjoyable but also with extra tanginess. Dessert varieties are as same as wild garden cafe and the taste was 👌🏻. Luxury with a very very average dining and unresponsive service; Keeping the restrooms and washrooms downstairs did not feel very hospitable. Couldn't recommend for a good meal.",

            "text": "Visiting the Birla Planetarium and Periyar Science and Technology Centre in Chennai was a great experience. There's a lot to see from life-size rocket models like the GSLV and BrahMos to interactive science exhibits. The 360-degree 3D sphere show was definitely a highlight really immersive and well done. I also found the weighing machine that shows your weight on different planets pretty cool.\n\nThe human evolution section with displays on early humans and Neanderthals was interesting and there were plenty of exhibits covering space chemistry and physics. The outdoor area had some dinosaur models though a few could use some maintenance. There were also some defense and technology exhibits adding to the variety. I noticed another 3D show but I didn't have time to check it out.\n\nOverall it's a great place for anyone interested in space and science. Definitely worth a visit especially for students and families",

This sums Bay View up\n\nTheir speciality for me is the Kovalam Curry. Basically a tangy onion-garlic curry with tamarind and a bit of spice that you can order with any seafood you want- I tried it with fish and prawns. The salty sea-food taste paired beautifully with this flavourful curry.\n\nPair it with their idiyappams, rice and parotta. I'm not a big fan of the Parotta though. It's a bit on the drier side and I've had much better Parotta outside:\n\nThere aren't too many good veg options, but their veg Kurma is amazing with idiyappam. Otherwise, the veg menu feels not worth it at all for the price. I tried a paneer starter from here which tasted terrible, overly spiced with chutney powder or something like that\n\nBut turn to seafood, the obvious speciality and this place is a banger. They serve full grills of whole fish, crabs, lobsters and prawns and also classic seafood dishes from Fish and Chips to Calamari. Both the Indian and foreign crowd that stay in this Taj will love the offerings.\n\nIt's a Taj Restaurant so quite obviously it's priced extremely high. But the food quality is definitely top class too so you can't complain. The price also accounts for the amazing seaside ambience. The chef is also very hospitable and talked to us in the table.\n\nYou cannot possibly not eat here if you stay in Taj Fisherman's Cove, or even if you visit the resort for any reason. The highlight of the entire hotel for sure.",

Orange juice was perfect with only fresh oranges and enough sugar, the best OJ I ever had. Butter fried prawns were awesome in taste and spiciness. The chicken rolls was good but a bit dry the dipping saw they provided was niche spicy hot sauce and mango saw was nice too. Couldn't order any main as it was almost 2:45. The waiter nudged us for the last order and we went for the dessert instead of main. We ordered 2 panacotta one with mango and other with pomegranate. I think they used grape jelly instead of pomegranate. But it was too good to not eat, we cleaned it up in a jiffy",

While the prices might be a bit on the higher side, the service is top-notch and truly exceptional. They offer romantic candlelight dinners and even have a special surprise room with beautiful flower and candle decorations, perfect for special occasions. It's a bit pricier at around ₹5,000 with food included, but it's worth it for the experience. Highly recommend for a memorable dining experience!",

To be frank i enjoyed every single bite. They have a squid starter and without a second thought I can say that it was the tastiest squid dish i have ever tasted and I would also include it in the list of the best dishes i have ever had. I loved everything that I ordered. They also serve yummy pizzas with a variety of choices . I enjoyed the ambience equally. With all the fairy lights and small huts, it looks beautiful and would be an apt place for a romantic dinner date. Bella ciao is undoubtedly one of the best hotels i have ever been to !!!

This place is not for young kids and women's since it's little deserted and very less people visit here. I just saw few locals fishing here.\nMy dear Drone Lovers…pls come and fly your drones here for an amazing videography and photography.",

Have to climb on large rocks to sit.\nThis place is quite popular among anglers and you can see a lot of people enjoying fishing. Since there is a very low footfall, you can have a very relaxed atmosphere. The only sound you will hear is waves crashing onto rocks and occasional fishing boats going out to sea.",
