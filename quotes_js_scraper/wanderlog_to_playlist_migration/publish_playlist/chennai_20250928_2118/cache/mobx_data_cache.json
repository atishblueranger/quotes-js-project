Park is so beautiful it's one the best places to visit in india. If u happen to make travel plans to tamil nadu Chennai one the best crocodile park. The crocodile are well taken care it's beautiful to visit with family. Tamil nadu government has been taking good care of the place. I visited from Mumbai with my family and it was best memory. People should visit such places for tourism and to know more about animals like crocodile.  Star rating would also fall less for I'm beyond speechless with my visit. Wish to visit them soon.."

The well-shaded surroundings make it a good place to visit even in summer. While it’s not a full-day attraction, it’s definitely worth a visit if you're in Chennai!\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes, definitely!"

              "reviewText": "Chennai International Airport  is one of India’s busiest and most important gateways, especially for travelers heading to and from South India. Located in Tirusulam, about 20 kilometers from the city center, the airport comprises two main terminals: one for domestic flights and another for international travel.\n\nThe airport has seen significant upgrades in recent years, with efforts to modernize its infrastructure and improve passenger experience. The newer sections of the terminal offer better lighting, expanded seating, cleaner washrooms, and improved signage. However, parts of the airport, especially in the domestic terminal, still feel dated and can get overcrowded during peak hours.\n\nIn terms of amenities, the airport offers a decent selection of food outlets, both local and international, as well as a few duty-free stores and lounges. Free Wi-Fi is available, though the connection can sometimes be patchy. Security and immigration processes, while thorough, are known to be slow during busy periods, which can be frustrating for travelers.\n\nConnectivity to the city is fairly good, with options such as taxis, app-based cabs, and a metro station nearby, although the walk from the terminal to the metro could be more convenient, especially with luggage.\n\nOverall, Chennai International Airport is functional and steadily improving. With ongoing expansion projects, it has the potential to become a more efficient and comfortable travel hub in the coming years."

Toilets and drinking water facilities are available in many places, and surprisingly, they are clean and easily accessible. However, I feel there’s a lack of animals—only a few can be seen here. Other than that, it’s a great place for kids to spend their day. The only downside is that food and snacks inside are a bit costlier compared to outside.\n\nPrice Details:\nAdult - ₹60\nBelow 5 Years - Free"

The huge bird cage which is the star attraction could have been a walk-in structure like other world class zoos and could also do with a flowing water feature given that most of the birds are aquatic. My son really liked the place"

The architecture is beautiful, and the station is well-maintained despite the huge crowd it handles daily. There are plenty of food stalls, waiting areas, and essential facilities like clean drinking water and restrooms. Connectivity is excellent, with metro, buses, and autos available right outside, making travel convenient.\n\nHowever, the station can get extremely crowded, and during peak hours, it feels chaotic. Cleanliness is decent but could be better, especially in waiting areas. Another downside is the occasional delay in trains, which can be frustrating. Also, auto drivers outside tend to overcharge, so be cautious if you’re hiring one.\n\nOverall, Chennai Central is a well-functioning and historic station, but some improvements in crowd management and cleanliness would make the experience even better!"

It is the Second major Railway Station of Tamilnadu, next only to Chennai Central.\n\nIt is built in Gothic Style of Architecture. It was the Head Quarters of S.I.R (South Indian Railways). It mainly caters to the Destinations in South Tamilnadu. Previously it was purely a Metre Gauge Terminal. Fastest Train of Metre Gauge System Vaigai Express (Chennai-Madurai) used to start from this Station.\n\nEgmore Station now has got 11 Platforms. Out of this 2 Platforms are for Suburban EMU Service and rest are for Long Distance Trains. Previously, this Station has the unique facility of Entering the Platform (right up to the Coach) which was not available anywhere in India. We can take our Car in Platform No:2 and take U turn and exit through Platform No:3. Now, this has become history.\n\nApart from Trains to South, now trains to Dadar, Kachiguda (Hyderabad), Kakinada and Jodhpur too start from this Station.\n\nStation premises is maintained neatly. For a long time, there were no Restaurent within the Station. Now there is A2B Restaurent which is a nice one. Escalators are also available in some Platforms.\n\nIn a nutshell, Egmore is not just a Railway Station. It has got so intertwined with the History of Chennai."

One of the major concerns is the lack of cleanliness, with an unpleasant odor throughout the premises. Additionally, there are no accessibility features such as escalators or elevators, making it extremely inconvenient for travelers with luggage, the elderly, or those with mobility issues. Carrying luggage up and down the old stairways can be exhausting. Given these issues, this station is not recommended as a starting point for your journey."

              "reviewText": "Though Egmore is an important station where all the south bound trains originate, it provides a horrible experience for those who come for picking up and dropping passengers. The recent changes around the station have taken away the small parking lot (which was already small and inadequate) at the entrance of the station. The alternate parking lot created a little ahead of the station is a big joke. Getting your car in and out of the so called parking lot will be a nightmare, that too if you are lucky enough in managing to get a vacant slot out of the 6 or 8 slots. If you leave your vehicle on the road because of urgency, the traffic police promptly puts wheel lock and charges fine. (The cop will start negotiating asking how much you are willing to pay and will warn you that it will be more than 1000 bucks if he goes the official route. However, be aware that the official fine for first time offence is 500 rupees and it will be 1000 if it is a repeat incident) . Even the vehicles entering for dropping off passengers do not have adequate space at the dropping zone and quite often there is a pandemonium in front of the station due to traffic snarls. On top of all these melee, the auto rickshaw drivers and porters fleece the passengers, not to miss their contribution to the ordeal."

From day one, he took the time to patiently address every concern, listen to even the smallest requests, and guide us through each stage of the treatment with clarity and empathy. His calm demeanor, depth of knowledge, and genuine care provided immense comfort and confidence—not just to the patient, but to our entire family. We are deeply grateful to him for being a pillar of strength during this challenging time.\n\nSupporting him was an outstanding team of doctors — Dr. Sivaram, Dr. Sivakumar, Dr. Banu, Dr. Kaviyarasi, Dr. Siddharth and Dr. Sendhil — who all contributed significantly to my mother’s care with professionalism, compassion, and precision.\n\nWe also extend heartfelt thanks to Mrs. Sasikala, who was with us every step of the way, managing meticulous follow-ups and offering reassuring support. Mr. Surya and Ms. Archana were equally helpful, always available and ready to assist with a smile.\n\nDuring the inpatient stay, the nursing team — Kaviyatharasi, Ashwini, Rajalakshmi, Sujitha, Vishnu, and Nisha — provided round-the-clock care with great attention and kindness. Their dedication ensured not only physical comfort but emotional reassurance. The physio, Mohamed, played a key role in the patient's quick recovery and boosting their confidence.\n\nThe dietitians, Jayalakshmi and Meenakshi, created personalized and thoughtful meal plans, and the catering team deserves appreciation for delivering meals that were both nutritious and enjoyable — always on time.\n\nWe’re thankful to the porters, especially Sarfaraz and his team, for moving patients with care and respect. The patient care team, led by Lakshmi, helped make the environment feel more like home, providing warm and consistent support.\n\nThe admissions team (Durga Devi & team) and the insurance team (Shiva, Angel & team) were extremely helpful in simplifying complex processes and ensuring we had all the information we needed.\n\nFinally, the security team deserves praise for their vigilance and discipline. Their strict protocols on visitation are done with the patient’s best interest in mind, and we truly appreciate their role in maintaining a safe and infection-free environment.\n\nTo the entire MGM Cancer Institute team — and most especially to Dr. Srivishnu — thank you for not just treating the illness, but for healing with heart, dedication, and humanity. We will always remain grateful."

The entrance is extremely narrow and typically full of pedestrians during rush hour so good luck finding a way in or out of the metro parking. With the aforementioned foot traffic there is only one foot overbridge which quickly gets crowded, another is desperately needed. A new terminal building is being constructed which hopefully will address the entrance problem but as it stands, the station infrastructure is totally inadequate for the ridership."

              "reviewText": "I had an opportunity to stay in Sundarban as part of the  Naturograhers. Seven of us roamed the waters for three days in search of royal Bengal tiger.\nIntroduction:\nSunderbans is an Indian national park, tiger reserve and biosphere reserve. 37% of Sunderban are in Indian side and 63% in Bangladesh side.\nThe name itself suggests the romantic meaning of\n\"Beautiful forest\". It is on the delta area in bay of Bengal covered by mangrove. It covers an area of 4260 square kilometers. It was declared Tiger Reserve in 1973 and WS in 1977. In 1984 it was declared a NP. In 1987 it was inscribed UNESCO world heritage site. In 2019 brought under Ramsar site.\n\nActivities:\nDay 01:\nWe boarded the boat Delta Queen in Godkhila. We traversed the waters of river Gomti and entered open waters which was banked by thick mangrove and rich tiger palms.  First day we went to Sudhanyakhali and watched many colourful birds. We also spotted and photographed water monitor lizard getting into the water to prey on small fishes. On the banks of open waters we saw crocodiles and leucastic crocodile.. Over the lush green tops we spotted a number of birds. Five types of kingfisher which can be spotted during winter were seen.\nBlack capped kf\nCommon kingfisher\nPurple sunbird\nOriental white eye\nSerpent eagle\nPergerine falcon\nCrocodile\nDeers\nRhesus monkeys\nGreen bee-eaters\nAt night we docked near a village and went out for owl spotting. We saw long tailed night jar, spotted owlets and barn owl.\nDay 2:\nWe floated along the canals and reached camp Dobonk. We carefully looked out for tiger but couldn't see. We sighted more birds\nCollared kingfisher\nCommon kingfisher\nWhitethtoaed kingfisher\nLeucastic crocodile\nStriated heron\nPond heron\nAdjutant stork\nPurple heron\nSecond day there was less activity on the banks and the mood in the boat was also less cheerful\nDay 03:\nWe all were slightly disappointed since we couldn't sight the RBT for which the Sunderbans are famous. Suddenly the guide called out \"tiger\" and bingo! We saw to our left the elusive RBT looking straight at us. Eventhough half her body was hidden by the shrubs we could estimate her being huge. The mood on the boat turned somber and every one clicked Her Royal Majesty. Exactly after one minute, she turned her back on us and disappeared from view. It was and still is like a dream.  The date and time 15.12.2019 11.32 AM is etched in our memory\nAccommodation:\nThe boat the NG booked was sturdy and spacious. Living quarter  was in the lower level. The upper deck was provided with comfortable chairs, a huge teapoi to keep the cameras, field guides and other things.\nGuide: mr. Mrithunjaya Mondal was very knowledgeble, patient and explained everything. He was fluent in English\nFood:\nFood was prepared on board. Both veg and non-veg was available. It tasted good and was prepared in a hygenic way.\nService:\nThe staff were helpful, cooperative and courteous.\nOn the whole it was an once in a life time experience. Hats off to NG."

I've subsequently been to multiple expeditions with them - Tadoba, Nilgiris, Ranthambore, Gir, Valparai and Sundarbans and the experience keeps getting better every time.\n\nDuring wildlife safaris, what's very important is to get a good guide - and Naturographers ensures we get one. During the Gir Trip, our guide Salim bhai helped us sight 6 lions, 5 lionesses and 4 cubs - while there were others who couldn't spot even 1 during a Safari.\n\nSimilarly we spotted the elusive tiger during our Sundarbans trip thanks to our expert guide.\n\nThanks team for igniting this passion of wildlife photography in me and also getting to make lifelong friends from these adventures!"

The station is spacious, with twin platforms and a 3,200 m² basement parking area, and is part of the iconic “Parakkum Rail” elevated line  .\n\nThe ambience is a mixed bag: the high ceilings, occasional wall murals, and views of the canal give a futuristic, open feel—some even call it \"Hollywood-esque\"  . It’s serene and uncrowded during off-peak times, ideal for calm waiting  . However, those high ceilings and broad platforms also can feel deserted, and parts suffer from poor upkeep—lighting is sometimes dim, escalators or lifts often don’t work, and there's an occasional musty odor  .\n\nIn terms of security, the station has minimal RPF presence and limited police patrols. While major incidents are rare, commuters—especially women—have reported feeling uneasy, particularly during non-peak hours  . One user shared:"

              "reviewText": "Kasturbanagar Railway Station is a modest but efficient transit hub that serves the suburban regions of Chennai. Here’s a detailed review based on its key features:\n\nLocation and Accessibility.\nKasturbanagar Railway Station is strategically located in a residential area, making it easily accessible to commuters living nearby. The station is well-connected by local roads and public transport, ensuring convenience for daily travelers. However, parking facilities are limited, which might pose a challenge for those driving to the station.\n\nFacilities.\nThe station offers basic amenities to meet the needs of its users. There are sheltered waiting areas and seating arrangements, though they can become crowded during peak hours. Cleanliness is generally maintained, though occasional lapses have been noted. There are no extensive dining options, but small vendors nearby cater to light refreshments and snacks. The absence of escalators or elevators may be inconvenient for senior citizens and people with disabilities.\n\nConnectivity.\nKasturbanagar serves as a stop for Chennai's suburban train network, providing excellent connectivity to key parts of the city. Trains are frequent and mostly punctual, making it a reliable choice for commuters. However, the limited number of long-distance trains stopping at this station might not appeal to intercity travelers.\n\nSafety and Security.\nThe station has adequate lighting, and the presence of station staff adds a sense of security, especially during evening hours. CCTV cameras are installed for added surveillance, though the lack of visible police patrols might concern some passengers.\n\nOverall Experience.\nKasturbanagar Railway Station is a functional and practical station that caters to the daily needs of suburban commuters. While it lacks the advanced facilities of larger stations, its simplicity and efficiency make it a vital part of Chennai’s rail network. Improvements in accessibility and facilities would enhance the overall experience."

        "topBlurb": "Chennai, a bustling city on the southeastern coast of India, is often celebrated for its rich culture, vibrant history, and delicious cuisine. However, nestled within this urban landscape are serene escapes that offer a breath of fresh air and a chance to connect with nature. One such gem is Guindy National Park, the smallest national park in the country, where you can wander among lush greenery and encounter a variety of wildlife, including over 130 species of birds and playful mammals. This tranquil oasis not only provides a perfect retreat for nature lovers but also features a delightful play area for children, making it an ideal spot for families looking to unwind amidst the hustle and bustle of city life.\n\nJust a stone's throw away from Guindy National Park lies the Chennai Snake Park, a fascinating destination that showcases a diverse collection of reptiles, including snakes and crocodiles. This family-friendly attraction complements the natural beauty of the park and serves as a vital conservation site. As you explore these parks, you'll also find significant landmarks like the Gandhi Mandapam, which pays tribute to India's independence. With so much to discover, Chennai's national parks offer a unique blend of adventure, education, and relaxation, inviting you to step away from the city's fast pace and immerse yourself in the wonders of nature.",

It has appellate jurisdiction over the state of Tamil Nadu and the union territory of Puducherry. It is one of the oldest high courts of India along with Calcutta High Court in Kolkata and Bombay High Court in Mumbai. The Madras High Court is one of four charter high courts of colonial India established in the four Presidency Towns of Madras, Bombay, Allahabad and Calcutta by letters patent granted by Queen Victoria, dated 26 June 1862. It exercises original jurisdiction over the city of Chennai, as well as extraordinary original jurisdiction, civil and criminal, under the letters patent and special original jurisdiction for the issue of writs under the Constitution of India. Covering 107 acres, the court complex is one of the largest in the world, second only to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom. The four-storey administrative building serves hundreds of litigants every day.\n\nHistory:\nTree-lined squares and red-brick buildings have witnessed many important moments in Indian legal history. Yet, the 127-year-old Madras High Court complex remains a relatively unexplored part of the city. Designed by JW Brassington, then consulting architect to the Government, its grand Indo-Saracenic structure was completed by Henry Irwin in 1892. Home to two of the city’s early lighthouses, one a Doric column of Pallavaram granite, the other atop a dome on the main building fuelled by kerosene and visible 32 miles out at sea, the complex’s turreted magnificence was what many first saw of Madras when they came in by masula boats from the bay."

Unfortunately, the space suffers from poor maintenance. The aesthetics are far from inviting, and the information provided is neither clear nor well-presented, which takes away from the experience. At present, it feels more like a neglected public space than a celebrated cultural landmark. I sincerely hope the government takes steps to revitalize it, perhaps even by collaborating with private partners, so that this treasure can be preserved and appreciated as it truly deserves."

It will take about 4 hours to comfortably leisurely walk around everything and enjoy the exhibits and relax in a lively location between the buildings. I was glad to see paintings by Indian artists (though you can't take pictures in these halls), find a portrait of Gandhi, known from banknotes. I was also interested in watching the recreation of the life of ancient people and, of course, examining the building itself: doors, stained glass windows, roof. I recommend visiting!

              "reviewText": "The Ripon Building, an architectural marvel in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, stands as the headquarters of the Greater Chennai Corporation. This iconic white structure, located near the Chennai Central Railway Station, exemplifies neoclassical architecture, blending Ionic and Corinthian styles. It is a significant remnant of British-era construction and a testament to the city's colonial history.\n\nThe foundation stone of the Ripon Building was laid in 1909 by the Earl of Minto, then Viceroy and Governor-General of India. Designed by G.S.T. Harris and constructed by Loganatha Mudaliar, the building took four years to complete and was officially commissioned in 1913. It was named after Lord Ripon, the Governor-General of British India, who was known as the father of local self-government.\n\nThe building is rectangular in shape, measuring 85 meters in length and 32 meters in width, with a central clock tower rising to a height of 43 meters. The Westminster Quarter chiming clock, installed by Oakes and Co. in 1913, features a mechanical key system and four bells cast by Gillet and Johnston. The structure comprises three floors, with the first floor covering approximately 2,800 square meters. Its walls were built with stock bricks and lime mortar plaster, while the original ground-floor flooring of Cuddapah Slate was later replaced with marble. The roof is supported by teak wood joists, enhancing its durability and aesthetic appeal.\n\nOver time, the Ripon Building has undergone renovations to preserve its grandeur. In September 2015, an annexe building named \"Amma Maaligai\" was inaugurated behind the main structure. This addition houses various departments of the Chennai Corporation, while the offices of the Mayor and Commissioner continue to operate from the original building. The annexe was constructed with modern sustainability features, including a water-cooled air-conditioning system and heat-reflective roof tiles to reduce energy consumption.\n\nThe surrounding area has evolved over the years, with developments such as the Chennai Metro and the modernization of the Central Railway Station complex enhancing the locality's overall appearance. The Ripon Building remains an administrative hub and a symbol of Chennai’s rich heritage, attracting history and architecture enthusiasts. Though primarily a working office, access to its interiors is generally restricted to official business or special heritage tours.\n\nIn front of the building, a well-maintained lawn features statues of Lord Ripon and Sir Thiyagaraya Chetty, further emphasizing its historical significance. The building’s elegant appearance, intricate detailing, and colonial charm continue to make it a notable landmark in Chennai, representing both its past and its enduring legacy in urban governance."

              "reviewText": "Victoria Public Hall in Chennai is a remarkable historical and architectural gem that stands as one of the finest examples of Indo-Saracenic architecture. Built in the late 19th century, it was originally intended as a town hall for public events and social gatherings, and it quickly became a prominent venue for significant political and cultural events. Eminent figures like Mahatma Gandhi, Swami Vivekananda, and Subramania Bharathi have addressed public gatherings here, marking its importance in India's freedom struggle.\n\nThe building itself is striking, with its red brick structure, Italianate tower, and Travancore-style roof. It also features intricate carvings and Corinthian columns that add to its grandeur. After years of restoration, which carefully preserved its heritage value, the hall was reopened to the public in 2011. It is now part of Chennai’s cultural landscape, hosting a variety of events, including plays and cultural performances.\n\nHowever, the hall's history also includes some controversies, such as illegal encroachments and challenges to its preservation, but it has been meticulously restored to maintain its historical integrity.\n\nFor anyone interested in colonial-era architecture or Chennai's historical landmarks, the Victoria Public Hall is a must-visit, not only for its stunning design but also for its deep connection to the city's past."

Located in the heart of Chennai, this station is not just a major transportation junction but also a historical landmark that reflects the city's colonial past and modern growth. The station’s architecture, with its striking red brick building and Gothic-style design, stands out as a heritage structure. It’s a blend of old-world charm and functional efficiency. Inside, the station is always bustling with activity, connecting millions of passengers across India daily. In terms of facilities, Chennai Central has seen considerable improvement over the years. There are clean waiting halls, digital information boards, escalators, elevators, food courts, and security systems in place. The platforms are relatively clean for a station that handles such high traffic. However, during peak hours, crowd management can be a challenge, and parking outside can be chaotic. One of the best aspects of the station is its connectivity. It links to local trains, metro services, and bus routes, making travel convenient. Also, the presence of prepaid taxi counters and app-based cab services makes commuting easier for travelers.\n\nOverall, Chennai Central is not just a railway station but a symbol of Chennai's spirit – vibrant, historic, and ever-evolving. Despite minor issues, it continues to serve as a lifeline for commuters and travelers from all over the country."

They handle lakhs of passengers every day, tonnes of goods and 100s of departures. This is one of the oldest railway stations in the country. They have 10+ platforms which operate trains which connect most of the major states and cities of India. The station will be filled with people always and neatly maintained. They also have a suburban station just next to it which helps people in moving to other places within Chennai easily. You can definitely say that this station is the heart of the city. This station is getting upgraded to handle future traffic too. I hope the station stands tall and serves the future generations as well."

With its iconic red-brick colonial architecture, it’s not just a transport hub but a historic landmark that represents the spirit of Chennai.\n\nThe station is well-organized, spacious, and efficiently managed despite handling a huge volume of passengers every day. It offers excellent connectivity to major cities across India, making it a lifeline for long-distance travelers. For more luggages porter trolleys available but price they take should never be more than 1000 taken as thats the only exploited part i found"

It's a bustling beehive of activity, where the cacophony of announcements, honking rickshaws, and endless streams of people create a unique atmosphere.\n\nThe architecture is a mix of colonial grandeur and modern functionality, with towering arches and intricate detailing. But let's be real, the real show is on the platforms. It's a chaotic ballet of passengers, luggage, and vendors selling everything from snacks to phone chargers.\n\nLove it or hate it, Chennai Central is an essential part of the city's fabric. It's a place where dreams are made, connections are forged, and memories are created. Just be prepared to navigate the crowds and embrace the chaos."

Upon entering, you’re greeted by a striking marble statue of Lord Cornwallis—an iconic landmark and conversation starter.\n\nGround floor features armaments and porcelain; an upper floor displays portraits, medals, and coins; and the top floor houses the Indian national flag hoisted after Independence.\n\nWell-preserved galleries, especially the detailed craftsmanship on artifacts and colonial ephemera.\n\nThe museum can feel quite warm, especially on hot days. Fans are few and spaced out.\n\nEntry ticket can be booked through online link, via QR codes only, at the entrance.\n\nSince the museum lies within a government compound, anticipate police screening. Carry a valid ID. Open from 9 AM to 5 PM. Entry Fee: Rs.20 per head. Bring water, there are limited facilities inside. St Mary’s Church (“Westminster Abbey of the East”) is worth exploring too.\n\nNice place to spend 1 to 2 hours with family.

The architecture is beautiful, and the station is well-maintained despite the huge crowd it handles daily. There are plenty of food stalls, waiting areas, and essential facilities like clean drinking water and restrooms. Connectivity is excellent, with metro, buses, and autos available right outside, making travel convenient.\n\nHowever, the station can get extremely crowded, and during peak hours, it feels chaotic. Cleanliness is decent but could be better, especially in waiting areas. Another downside is the occasional delay in trains, which can be frustrating. Also, auto drivers outside tend to overcharge, so be cautious if you’re hiring one.\n\nOverall, Chennai Central is a well-functioning and historic station, but some improvements in crowd management and cleanliness would make the experience even better!"

While it sees thousands of travelers every day, the overall experience could be much better.\n\nDespite being such a major hub, the station lacks proper maintenance. Cleanliness is a serious issue, public toilets are in poor condition, and there are not enough comfortable seating areas for passengers.\n\nThe premium lounge is only accessible to those who can afford it, while the government lounge is almost always overcrowded. For a city that deals with extreme heat and heavy passenger traffic, the station really needs improvement in infrastructure and basic amenities.\n\nA station of this importance deserves better upkeep and facilities."

Established in 1890 and opened to the public in 1896, it was named after Lord Connemara, the then Governor of Madras.\nI remember visiting as a 8 year old when the upkeep of the library was not so good. When i visited recently, i was pleasantly surprised to see how well the library is maintained, along with air conditioned reading rooms. If you need a quiet place to settle down and read, look no further."

The church might not be open late so it’s always better to visit early and not late.\n\nPhotography and videography of ringing bells not allowed . You are not allowed to go near the bells. The bell tower is locked."

From the outside you won't even know that such a beautiful church exists, as the street outside is very busy and congested and the church's exterior wall and the main entrance may not be easily identifiable.  Even the street vendors outside wrongly directed me to the catholic church nearby when I asked them about the Armenian church!! The place is maintained extremely neat and clean. It is a different feeling when you step inside the compound and as you walk past the main entrance the chaos of the busy city vanishes and you are suddenly transported into a different place altogether like a time traveler!! The place is very calm and quiet unlike the noisy and chaotic streets just outside!!! The caretaker informed that the church is open to all and anyone can come and pray. There is no regular mass at this church. It is maintained by a few Armenian families in Chennai. If you enjoy peaceful and calm places of worship, then this place is a must visit place for you!!!"

Her initial mark sheet reflected everything correctly, including assignment submissions. However, when the consolidated mark sheet was generated, it falsely showed \"assignment not done.\" Despite the fact that it was submitted and verified earlier, the university failed to correct the error.\n\nI personally visited the university more than 20 times to resolve this, but nothing was done. Sadly, my wife is no longer with us, and it's heartbreaking to see this kind of negligence. If a university can not manage records properly or support its students and families, they shouldn’t be allowed to operate. It is completely unprofessional and irresponsible."

              "reviewText": "The Thousand Lights Shia Mosque, situated on Peter's Road in Royapettah, Chennai, stands as one of the city’s most iconic and historic religious landmarks.\n\nIts origins trace back to the early 19th century when Nawab Umdat-ul-Umrah of the Wallajah dynasty commissioned its construction on land previously used by Shia Muslims as a gathering place, especially during the month of Muharram.\n\nThe mosque derives its evocative name from the tradition of illuminating its vast prayer hall with a thousand oil lamps, creating a mesmerizing spectacle that has become part of local legend.\n\nArchitecturally, the mosque is a striking example of Indo-Islamic design, featuring multiple domes and tall minarets that rise prominently above the bustling Anna Salai area.\n\nThe main prayer hall is spacious and adorned with Quranic inscriptions, while separate areas are designated for men and women. The mosque complex also includes a Dargah dedicated to Imam Hussain (Raziyallahu Anhu), the revered grandson of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, further enhancing its spiritual significance for the Shia community.\n\nThe Thousand Lights Mosque is not only a vibrant center for daily worship but also a focal point during Muharram, when thousands gather to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Hussain. The atmosphere during these observances is solemn, with the mosque beautifully lit and filled with the sounds of prayer and reflection.\n\nVisitors are welcomed, provided they dress modestly and observe the decorum expected in a place of worship. The mosque’s central location makes it easily accessible, and it remains open from early morning until late evening, inviting both devotees and those interested in its history and architecture to experience its unique ambiance.\n\nBeyond its religious functions, the mosque is a symbol of Chennai’s pluralistic heritage and serves as a reminder of the city’s deep-rooted connections to diverse faiths and traditions. Its enduring presence, historical roots, and architectural grandeur make it a must-visit for anyone seeking to understand the cultural and spiritual fabric of Chennai."

I was young and had a lot of dreams .But it has to be realized in a 4000 Sq.ft plot. I didn’t know anything about construction and also not much time. Murali understood me and brought out a masterpiece. I told him the concept and he designed. Our friendship developed over 2 decades and subsequently we did 3 more buildings. Finally he also designed my house which was more than my dream. What impressed me over these years is his willingness to listen to our views. Professionally we have grown 4 times in volume and the building has accommodated this growth. Hallmark of his style is the ventilation and Light which has given us the energy to work under stressful conditions.  Now we are on the process of expanding our facility. I cannot think of any other architect who can understand the client and give a product which will stand the test of time.\nBEST WISHES TO MURALI AND HIS TEAM"

              "reviewText": "The brief to PSP Design was to re -construct a building with dual purpose - one that would offer the utility of commercial spaces on the lower levels, combined with the privacy of a residential apartment on the topmost floor.\nThis meant constructing a replica of a 70 year old traditional space above a modern commercial office, without a clash of styles. It’s no easy task to re use all existing doors and windows - curvatures were meticulously measured so also positions of doors, windows and all else, at the same time adjusting with accuracy to the demands of new needs of Vastu compliance.\n\nOver and above it all, it had to meet the energy efficiency requirements of the Gold LEED certification too.\n\nFrom start to finish, Ajay Sethi and Sunil Philip of PSP Design supervised everything with unparalleled dedication and professionalism which has resulted in architectural excellence. While the lower floors have a clear glass façade to encourage commercial display visibility, the residence with its large open to sky courtyard and screened verandahs provides ample natural light and ventilation.\n\nI’m extremely happy with The Heritance - and kudos to the team for their professionalism, dedication and giving me a home that I cherish.\n\nSushila Gopinath"

So there was another structure built, which is now referred to as old temple. Recently a new structure is built and it is referred to as new temple.\nEntire premises are clean and very well maintained. It has positive vibes which you can feel as soon as you enter this place.

It’s tall clock tower is visible from quite a distance and it’s red and white paint job make it a unique structure in the area.\n\nLayout: (5/5)\nThe station is a junction so that means accessing all the platforms does not require one to climb up and down stairs which is great in terms of wheel chair accessibility. The station also has buggies to ferry elderly people to and from the train compartments.\n\nAmenities: (5/5)\nThis stations boasts of some of the largest number of eateries in any station in the country. The large hall allows for great set of stores including biriyani outlets to juice stall to absolutely any type of food or drink that someone may want. There are also multiple waiting rooms.\n\nAesthetics: (3/5)\nThis is perhaps where the station could certainly improve. Though it is not as bad as it once was in terms of cleanliness, there is still a long way to go. Given the new paint job done internally on the walls and the images of various stages of the railway history on the walls, this is a step in the right direction. However, the floor is still quite dirty in many places and the open waiting areas need a better means of seating and accommodating so many passengers.\n\nSummary: (5/5)\nI would given central a 5 because it is a beautiful heritage structure that is on the journey to beautiful and better itself."

One of the highlights of my visit was the 4D VR show, which took us through Swami Vivekananda's powerful and spiritual journey in a truly immersive way.\n\nThe visuals, sound, and storytelling were amazing—it felt like I was walking alongside him through different phases of his life, especially his journey to the West and his speech at the Parliament of Religions in Chicago. It gave me a deeper understanding of his vision, thoughts, and contribution to Indian philosophy.\n\nOverall, it's a must-visit place for anyone interested in history, spirituality, or just looking for inspiration. I left the place feeling motivated and proud of our rich cultural heritage."

There are are couple of theatres inside the museum where his Chicago speech, his early life are been portrayed. It will take some time in order to visit the museum. There is also a mediation hall where you can sit and meditate which is described as the place where he used to meditate when he came to Chennai.\n\nThey do have a bookstore where they sell his books. The ticket charges ₹50 per head. They will also take a photo free of cost and can be downloaded from the link they provide."

I’ve been seeing this place from outside for more than 25 years, since my childhood, as it is close to my grandfather’s house. Whenever I go across Marina, this pink building always stands out and reminds me of its cultural and historical significance.\n\nThough many people visit inside for school trips, exhibitions, or spiritual visits to learn about Swami Vivekananda and experience peace, the outside itself has a charm. Recently, opposite Vivekananda House, they have started putting up a big screen for open-air Tamil movie screenings, where the crowd sits together to watch evergreen films. The atmosphere becomes lively, with nearby stalls selling hot crispy bhajjis, ice creams, seafood like fish and prawn, fried rice, sodas, and popcorn – giving a true Chennai beachside vibe.\n\nThis place beautifully balances heritage and modern leisure – inside for culture and spirituality, and outside for entertainment and food. Truly, Vivekananda House is not just a building but a symbol of Marina itself."

              "reviewText": "Anna University is the most renowned name among the Engineering colleges in Tamilnadu which is now renamed as College of Engineering, Guindy. Several courses are being offered in the campus like B.Arch, Manufacturing Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electrical and Electronics Engineering, CSE,IT,ECE, Production and PG degrees like ME and MBA. Distance education mode is also available. Most of the entrance exams are conducted here. Visited here recently for an entrance exam. It could be organised well with many indications and supporting firms for helping the visitors to make their experience a hassle free one. Most of the people were misguided about the directions as there was no guidance about the routes. Alagappa College of Technology is visited inside the campus. Cultural fests are organised very well by the students who are planning it enthusiastically with full on spirits. Hostel facilities and student amenities are arranged separately for Other region Students.  Located exactly opposite to Gandhi Mandapam , Guindy. 21G is the most frequent and direct bus to reach Anna University."

I was informed that the church remains closed on Saturdays and is open only on Sundays.\n\nThis was surprising to me because, according to the information available online, the church is shown as open. This mismatch caused confusion and disappointment.\n\nI kindly request the church management to look into this matter. It would be helpful if the correct visiting hours could be updated online, so that visitors are well-informed in advance."

Unlike the recent churches that make church service an English rock show service at this church is calm and soul stirring.\n\nMany good old people to speak to and get volumes of knowledge.\n\nA must visit place for any person who is in search of himself or as a traveling stop."

The body of the church is a circle, with rectangular compartments to the east and west. The circular part 24.5 m in diameter, is crowned by a shallow masonry dome colored a deep blue. This is painted with golden stars and supported by 16 fluted pillars with Corinthian capitals.\n\nDominating the altar is the pipe organ in dull green and burnished gold.

Since the building is open to the public only on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, and with limited slots available, we booked our visit a month in advance—it was the earliest available slot. The best part? It's completely free of cost. The walk lasted for one hour, from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM and the timing is followed strictly as the building resumes its regular office hours at 9:30 AM, after which visitors are not permitted. Our guide, Mr. Muhilan was incredibly knowledgeable. He explained each area in great detail, sharing fascinating insights into the history, architecture and significance of the Ripon Building. The entire hour flew by and I found the experience both enriching and memorable. Overall, it was absolutely worth the visit—a great opportunity to explore one of Chennai’s most historic landmarks and learn about its rich civic legacy."

The interiors are well maintained, and the festive decorations always create a vibrant and welcoming vibe. There’s ample parking space, though finding a spot on weekends can take a bit more time.\n\nThey’ve also recently opened ‘The Board Room’ at LUXE Cinemas, which is a great new addition. It’s definitely a must-visit if you haven’t been here yet. The only downside is that the restrooms in all floors could be better maintained."

I tried a few dishes, and everything was delicious and freshly prepared.\n\nWhat really stood out was the cleanliness and the staff's helpful attitude throughout the mall. The security arrangements were solid, and directions were clearly marked, making navigation easy even for first-time visitors like me.\n\nFor entertainment, the multiplex cinema and fun zones for kids and families make it a complete day-out destination.

The first impression is impressive, the place is huge, modern, and very lively. It really does feel like a one stop destination with shopping, dining, movies, and events all under one roof.\n\nThe shopping experience was great with a wide variety of both international and local brands. The layout is spacious, and the interiors are well maintained, so it doesn’t feel cramped even when it’s busy. The highlight for me was the overall ambience, it’s bright, clean, and designed in a way that makes walking around enjoyable.\n\nThe food court has lots of options from quick bites to proper meals, though it does get crowded during peak hours and finding a seat can be tricky. Still, the range of choices makes it worth the wait. Entertainment wise, the IMAX theatre and regular live events in the atrium add a fun dimension beyond shopping.\n\nParking is available, though the charges feel a little on the higher side. Since I used Rapido, I avoided that hassle, but for those driving it’s something to keep in mind. Staff and security were polite and helpful whenever I needed directions.\n\nOverall, Phoenix Marketcity is a great spot to spend a few hours or even a full day. It’s ideal for family outings, catching up with friends, or just a solo shopping spree. My advice: if you want to avoid the heavy crowds, try visiting on a weekday."

Approached Vivek and nandha for a small project and they delivered a brilliant elevation in a week span and that too with less spending from our pocket. This was just a trial from us to see if it works. We could see more visitors reaching us for buying. Thats when we decided to stick with this young and energetic team. We have done 5 projects with them and that to end to end . Starting from floor plan , elevation till the wiring. They are the go to team for the past 6 years for us.  Thanks to inva team !!!!"

You cannot reach to the sea water as this is a man made bridge (road) to access the fishing boats. It is far better breeze and nice experience than Marina Beach. There is no sand in it just a road with stones and concrete blocks to safeguard the road.\n\nIf you are in a 2 wheelers, you can go till the end of the fishing harbour. Better to leave the place before sun set.\n\nMostly, local people will be in the beach.\nGovernment must think and improve the infrastructure and conditions of the entire place like a “Smart City”. It is completely  unattended to improve anything beyond the fishing market which is very sad part."

History, Anthropology and children building components of museum are worth visiting.\nA library in the centre of museum is another well maintained spot.\nOverall excellent. Of course,we could see a part of presentations in 3 hours. Full viewing needs almost full day.\nOnly thing, which I found at the ticket counter missing was online mode of payment. In this age of technology, museum management must review mode of online payment at reservation counter in place of cash payment for purchase of tickets"

They don't accept any other mode of payment."

Unfortunately, the space suffers from poor maintenance. The aesthetics are far from inviting, and the information provided is neither clear nor well-presented, which takes away from the experience. At present, it feels more like a neglected public space than a celebrated cultural landmark. I sincerely hope the government takes steps to revitalize it, perhaps even by collaborating with private partners, so that this treasure can be preserved and appreciated as it truly deserves."

It will take about 4 hours to comfortably leisurely walk around everything and enjoy the exhibits and relax in a lively location between the buildings. I was glad to see paintings by Indian artists (though you can't take pictures in these halls), find a portrait of Gandhi, known from banknotes. I was also interested in watching the recreation of the life of ancient people and, of course, examining the building itself: doors, stained glass windows, roof. I recommend visiting!

The gopuram is stunning with its intricate carvings – you can spend quite some time just admiring the details. Inside, the temple has a very peaceful atmosphere despite being busy most of the time. the chants and lamps made it feel even more spiritual.\n\nThe area around the temple is also lively with small shops and traditional food stalls, which adds to the charm. Parking can be a bit tricky, and the crowd is usually heavy, but that’s expected at such a famous temple. If you’re in Chennai, this is definitely a must-visit, both for the architecture and the divine experience."

Whenever I visit chennai i make sure to go to this temple the aura the architecture the sculpture and the serenity of this hindu temple attracts me so much. Like Gorakhpur temple of UP here also I saw lots of idols of sadhus . Photography of idols is prohibited. This time i visited the temple early morning around 5 am still I could see good number of devotees there.  If visiting Chennai must go to kapaleshwar temple for darshan."

The nadaswaram and tavil during puja, the fragrance of jasmine and camphor, and the bustle around the temple tank create a beautiful, old-Madras vibe. Darshan usually moves smoothly; priests are courteous and the premises are kept clean with clear signboards and organized footwear counters. Visit early morning or around the evening aarti for cooler weather and fewer crowds (festival days—especially Panguni Peruvizha/Arubathimoovar—get packed). Dress modestly; photos are fine in the outer prakarams but avoid the sanctum. Parking is easiest around the tank streets.\n\nSecret tip: after offering at Karpagambal’s shrine, step to the Punnai (temple) tree and look up—you’ll spot carvings and imagery of the peacock tied to the temple’s legend. At sunset, walk the tank’s east side for the best reflection shot of the gopuram."

All sannadhis are visible from long itself which I feel so special. Even in heavy crowd can have a good view of Mulavar from outside itself . Idols of 108 Nayanmargal around Mulavaru gives you the divine vibe . Must visit in weekdays as it is lightly crowded even on Friday odd hours . Definitely in weekends or in special occasions temple will be heavily crowded . Must visit Temple OM NAMAH SHIVAYA 🙏"

My last trip was unforgettable tall lighthouse, playful dogs, fishermen readying boats, cool breeze and a vibrant sunrise. The peaceful yet lively scene was a perfect mix of nature, energy and emotion I hope to capture again."

              "reviewText": "Marina Beach is one of the longest urban beaches in the world. The beach stretches endlessly and offers great views of the Bay of Bengal, especially during sunrise and sunset. The vast open space, sea breeze, and golden sand make it a peaceful spot to unwind—from a distance.\n\nThat said, the overall experience was mixed. While the beach is iconic and lively, it’s also not very well maintained in many areas. There’s noticeable litter on the sand, and even though clean-up crews are around, the volume of visitors makes it hard to keep up. Swimming is not advisable, as the currents are strong and there are no lifeguards clearly visible.\n\nFrom a tourist's perspective, it’s worth visiting early in the morning or late in the evening to avoid the heat and large crowds. Street food stalls line the stretch, selling everything from spicy sundal to corn and ice cream. While tempting, hygiene can be a concern, so be cautious. There are also vendors selling souvenirs, toys, and local crafts.\n\nParking is available near the beach but can be chaotic, especially on weekends. Public toilets exist but are basic and could be better maintained. Nearby attractions include Vivekananda House, light house, and some old colonial buildings that are worth a quick visit.\n\nMarina Beach is best enjoyed for a short stroll, photo ops, and people-watching—but don’t expect a pristine, relaxing beach experience."

The long stretch of golden sand, the sound of waves crashing, and the cool sea breeze make it a perfect place to unwind, especially during early mornings and evenings. It’s also a great spot for walking or just sitting and watching the sunset. The beach is usually crowded, especially on weekends, but the lively atmosphere adds to its charm. There are plenty of street food stalls offering local snacks like sundal and bhajji, which are a must-try. While the beach could be cleaner in some areas, efforts have been made to maintain it better. Overall, Marina Beach offers a refreshing break from city life and is a must-visit for anyone in Chennai."

Built over the tomb of St. Thomas the Apostle 🕊️—one of the 12 Apostles of Jesus—this Basilica is one of only three churches in the world built over an apostle’s tomb, alongside St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome and Santiago de Compostela in Spain 🌍.\n\nAt the ground level, there is a small but meaningful museum 🎨 displaying relics and items related to St. Thomas and the history of Santhome. You can see the lance head 🗡️ that pierced him, a rare bone fragment 🦴, his chair, stone receptacle, ancient coins 🪙, Persian medallions, monograms, multilingual inscriptions, and beautiful canvas paintings 🖼️. Each exhibit is well-described with explanatory plaques for context 📖.\n\nAbove the museum, there is a mini theatre 🎥 that screens a short documentary on St. Thomas and the history of the Basilica—informative and spiritually enriching.\n\nOne of the main attractions is the image of Our Lady of Mylapore 👑.

Most \"structures\" were not covered with plants yet (I think they had places for pots), maybe we visited between changes. Car park was available for 100 rupees and entrance was for 75 per adult. There were slides and swings for children."

Good things is some of the old trees are retained and developed the park.\nGood time to visit the park evening and if you go during oct, nov and dec park will be more greenery.\nYou can’t enter to specific area inside the park if cinema shooting happen."

              "reviewText": "Semmozhi Poonga, located in the heart of Chennai near the Government Museum and Egmore Railway Station, was envisioned as a modern urban park celebrating Tamil language and heritage. While the concept is commendable, the overall experience falls short of expectations, warranting a modest 2-star rating.\n\n**Ambience & Aesthetics (2.5/5):**\nThe park is built on reclaimed land that was once a degraded area, and its transformation into a landscaped garden is a step in the right direction. The name \"Semmozhi Poonga\" (Classical Language Park) reflects a noble intent to promote Tamil culture. There are thematic sections dedicated to Tamil literature and poets, along with sculptures and inscriptions. However, the maintenance is inconsistent—patches of dry grass, wilted plants, and unclean water features detract from the visual appeal. The garden lacks the vibrancy and lushness one would expect from a botanical or heritage park.\n\n**Cleanliness & Maintenance (1.5/5):**\nThis is where the park struggles the most. Littering is common, restrooms are poorly maintained, and there’s a noticeable lack of regular upkeep. Some areas feel neglected, with broken benches and faded signage. The fountains and water bodies often appear stagnant or non-functional, which is disappointing given the park’s central location.\n\n**Visitor Experience (2/5):**\nThe park is open to the public and is often frequented by families, students, and elderly visitors looking for a green space in the city. It’s relatively peaceful compared to busier parks, but the lack of engaging activities, play areas for children, or proper seating limits its appeal. Security and lighting are adequate during the day, but it's not recommended to visit after dusk.\n\n**Accessibility & Facilities (2/5):**\nLocated centrally, it's easily accessible by public transport. There’s a nominal entry fee, and security checks are in place. However, facilities like drinking water, clean restrooms, food stalls, and shaded sitting areas are either inadequate or poorly maintained.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSemmozhi Poonga has the potential to be a cultural and ecological gem for Chennai. Unfortunately, poor maintenance, lack of visitor engagement, and inconsistent upkeep bring down the overall experience. With better management and regular care, it could rise to its intended glory. As of now, it’s a decent spot for a quick stroll, but don’t expect a well-groomed or inspiring green space.\n\n**Rating: ★★☆☆☆ (2 out of 5)**\n*Recommended for: Casual walk, cultural curiosity. Not ideal for families or nature lovers seeking a serene environment.*"

The divine presence of the Astalakshmis alongside Mahavishnu brings a sense of peace and positivity. There is ample parking space near the seashore, making it a perfect spot for a memorable outing on a budget. Although the temple is currently under renovation, it is still worth a visit."

You climb step-by-step, symbolically ascending towards spiritual growth.\nThe main shrine houses Lakshmi ji with Lord Vishnu"

There has been no proper response or communication from the concerned department, and due to this delay, my admission elsewhere is getting affected.\n\nTo those planning to apply here — please think twice. Don’t waste your valuable time and effort.\nThe canteen and infrastructure also need major improvement. While the campus is large, the management seriously needs to start thinking from the students’ perspective."

Her initial mark sheet reflected everything correctly, including assignment submissions. However, when the consolidated mark sheet was generated, it falsely showed \"assignment not done.\" Despite the fact that it was submitted and verified earlier, the university failed to correct the error.\n\nI personally visited the university more than 20 times to resolve this, but nothing was done. Sadly, my wife is no longer with us, and it's heartbreaking to see this kind of negligence. If a university can not manage records properly or support its students and families, they shouldn’t be allowed to operate. It is completely unprofessional and irresponsible."

              "reviewText": "Spencer Plaza is a Chennai landmark. It's large, cavernous mall that does things differently. The mix of stores, the pathways to the different sections etc. are quite unique. If you have time, then a 'slowish' walk across the mall will be rewarding. However, if on a tight schedule please do check the location of the store and move there directly. On my last visit, I noticed that some of the larger stores had moved. This is a bit disturbing given the eccentric mix of stores seems to be out of balance i.e. the mix of traditional stores, large franchises and independent stores is now skewed. Regardless a great place to shop and/or wander around. Food options are better today but needs to improve."

As India’s oldest shopping mall, its rich history is palpable in every corridor. The diverse range of shops—from traditional handicrafts to modern brands—offers a unique shopping experience. While newer malls have emerged, Spencer Plaza’s vintage ambiance and cultural significance make it a must-visit. It’s heartening to see it retaining its essence amidst the evolving cityscape."

The atmosphere here is a far cry from the glitzy, modern malls you find everywhere today. Instead, it feels more grounded, raw, and nostalgic. You’ll find narrow corridors, old signage, and a maze of local shops that give it real character.\n\nWhat makes it special is the mix of heritage and hustle. You can find everything from handmade Kashmiri rugs and leather goods to vintage electronics and quirky trinkets. It’s a treasure hunt more than a typical shopping trip. And while the facilities might seem outdated compared to Phoenix or Express Avenue, the charm lies in its imperfections.\n\nIt’s definitely worth visiting if you love history, want to support small businesses, or just want a break from the cookie-cutter mall experience. You won’t find global luxury brands here, but you’ll find soul and that’s rare."

As the longest natural urban beach in the country, it offers a picturesque setting with its silver sand, blue sea, and stunning sunrise and sunset views. However, there are a few things to keep in mind:\nUndercurrents: While the beach is beautiful, the undercurrents can be strong, making it challenging for swimmers. It’s essential to exercise caution and stay safe.\nKannagi Statue: Look out for the “Kannagi” statue, which tells the story of the legendary character from a South Indian epic. It adds a cultural touch to the beach experience.\n\nDuration: Plan to spend 2-3 hours at Marina Beach. Whether you’re taking a leisurely stroll, enjoying the sea breeze, or simply relaxing, there’s something for everyone.\n\nAmenities: Nearby, you’ll find amenities like parking, restaurants, and showers. These facilities enhance the overall experience for visitors.\n\nMarina Beach is a must-visit spot in Chennai, offering a blend of natural beauty, history, and local culture"

I’ve been visiting it regularly – both early in the mornings and late at night, and each visit has something special to offer.\n\n🌅 Sunrise at the beach is a serene and beautiful experience. The soft golden light, the gentle sound of waves, and the cool breeze instantly lift your mood. It’s the perfect time to go for a peaceful walk or just sit by the shore and soak in the calmness before the city wakes up.\n\n🌇 Sunset, on the other hand, brings its own charm. The sky turns into a canvas of oranges and pinks, and the atmosphere becomes livelier with people strolling, kids playing, and street food vendors lighting up the beachside. There’s something so refreshing and calming about the place, no matter what time of day it is. The moment you step onto the sand, you feel a sense of peace and lightness that only the sea can bring.\n\n🎉 One of the exciting things about Bessie is that they screen IPL matches on big screens during the season! It adds a vibrant community vibe, with people cheering, relaxing with friends and family, and enjoying snacks while watching the game in the open air with the sea breeze around.\n\nWhether you’re looking for quiet reflection during sunrise, chilling with friends in the evening, or even just grabbing a bite from the food stalls, Besant Nagar Beach never disappoints. It’s clean, lively, and safe, and has become a sort of personal escape zone for me within the city.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone visiting Chennai or even locals who haven’t made this part of their regular routine yet!"

Whether you visit at dawn, when the sky blushes softly, or in the evening under the moonlit glow, the place feels magical. The waves are lively but soothing, and the breeze carries that unmistakable salty freshness.\n\nThere’s a lively stretch near the shore with small stalls, local snacks, and the hum of people enjoying themselves, yet you can always find quieter corners to just sit and watch the ocean. The beach is perfect for long walks, photography, or simply letting time slow down while the waves kiss your feet.\n\nIf you’re in Chennai, Basant Nagar Beach isn’t just a spot—it’s an experience. 🌊✨"

              "reviewText": "Presidency College is an arts, law and science college in the city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu, India. Established as the Madras Preparatory School on October 15, 1840 and later, upgraded to a high school and then, graduate college, the Presidency College is one of the oldest government arts colleges in India. It is one of the two Presidency colleges established by the British in India, the other being the Presidency College, Kolkata.. At the behest of Sir Thomas Munro, a Committee of Public Instruction was formed in 1826. In 1836, the duties of the Committee were taken over by a \"Committee of Native Education\". The plans drawn up by the Committee did not commend themselves to the Governor of Madras, Lord Elphinstone, who in turn proposed nineteen resolutions which were passed unanimously.[1]\nAs first Principal, the choice of Elphinstone fell on E. B. Powell, a University of Cambridge Wrangler in Mathematics, who accepted the post. Powell reached Mumbai (Bombay) on 20 September 1840 but did not arrive at Chennai (Madras) until 24 November, the journey from Bombay to Madras taking some four weeks. In the mean time, the Committee had invited a Mr Cooper, from the Hoogly College, Kolkata (Calcutta), to carry out the duties of Principal temporarily, at a salary of Rs. 400 a month. Cooper accepted the invitation and came to Chennai (Madras). He and his staff opened Presidency School, a preparatory school, in a rented building in Egmore known as Edinburgh Home on 15 October 1840. Cooper remained in the preparatory school for only a few months. Soon after Eyre Burton Powell's arrival and before the opening of the high school department in April 1841, he returned to Kolkata (Calcutta). The preparatory School was shifted to Popham's Broadway in 1841.[1]\nThe schools grew into Presidency College. When the University of Madras was founded in 1857, Presidency College was affiliated to it.[1]\nIn 1870, the college moved to its present location in Kamaraj Salai, opposite Marina Beach.. One of the best college in Chennai. Most of the Eminent people are studied here"

Within an hour, while we were at a nearby shop, the place got Crowded—seems like we picked the perfect timing! 📸 Got some good clicks too!\n\nI had visited this beach ages ago, but it has Developed significantly since then. Noticed some great improvements, like a ramp for the physically challenged ♿ and an increase in the number of shops. The beach is full of vibrant energy, with plenty of activities and games to enjoy. 🏖️🎈\n\nCompared to Marina & Pattinapakkam, this place has a unique charm for me—maybe a personal connection, who knows? 😄 Besant Nagar Beach feels quieter, cleaner, and well-organized, making it perfect for a Peaceful walk, reading, or simply enjoying the waves. 🌊✨ Definitely a must-visit spot!"

Another positive thing here is that there are a lot of street food shops nearby, which serve fish meals and fish fry. Recommended if one is interested to watch sunrise and sunsets."

Don’t expect a well-maintained or lively beach experience—this is more of a local hangout spot with average cleanliness and basic facilities. Not recommended for those looking for a proper beach vacation."

The snow was real, soft, and fresh, and the temperature was just right to enjoy comfortably with the provided jackets,hand gloves and boots. Also they ensured it’s properly cleaned before giving to next visitor.\n\nThe space is well-maintained, clean, and very safe for families. There are plenty of fun activities like snow slides, snowball play zones, and even mini igloos for the little ones to explore. The staff were friendly, attentive, and made sure everyone was enjoying safely.\n\nOnly key improvement is needed in WASHROOM. Not happy with quality of cleanliness and standards set by VGP Management.\n\nAmple parking space available.\n\nPerfect for just experiencing snow in chennai. Highly recommended for some chilly fun and unforgettable memories!"

Online booking available as also spot booking. Rs.750 per person and if you want additional jungle safari and 12D they charge another 200 for both. Childrens loved it. Highly recommended."

I feel that the temple needs so more cleaning and hygiene due to huge crowd and will work better than now. I really felt blessed to get a chance to visit these places.\n\nThe only thing I found about the priests, they are always into rush in any famous temples. Even though less crowd they always ask devotees to go out as fast as they can. But if you see positive sides then one of the best temple to visit in Chennai. Lovely."

Here's what stood out:\n\nHistory & Architecture\n\nOne of Chennai’s oldest surviving temples, originally built by the Pallavas in the 6th–8th century, then expanded by the Cholas and later Vijayanagara kings  .\n\nA proud Divya Desam, praised in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham by the Alvars  .\n\nFeatures classic Dravidian structure: towering Raja Gopuram, ornate stone pillars, 36-pillared mandapam, and detailed carvings  .\n\nMultiple Forms of Perumal\n\nCentral shrine houses Lord Parthasarathy (Krishna–Charioteer of Arjuna), unique with a moustache (“Meesai Perumal”) and holding only a conch (no discus), believed to bear Bheeshma’s arrow scars from Kurukshetra  .\n\nOther shrines honor Yoga Narasimha, Rama, Gajendra Varadaraja, and Ranganatha, making it a revered Panchamurthi sthalam  .\n\nMeesai Perumal & Variants\n\nThe moustached form is an iconic visual; during certain days of Vaikunta Ekadasi, he's shown without a moustache, symbolizing humility  .\n\nThe temple also includes a distinct shrine for Yoga Narasimha, with its own entrance and dhvajastambha  .\nPrasadam\n\nThe Ven Pongal served here is particularly sweet and rich, made with extra ghee and cashews—believed to soothe the deity's arrow wounds  .\n\nCommon temple prasadam like Puliyodarai is also loved by devotees  .\n\nLocation & Atmosphere\n\nSituated in the heart of Triplicane, just a few minutes from Marina Beach, yet it feels like a peaceful oasis  .\n\nReal devotees comment on its positive aura, dedicated priests, and well-maintained grounds  .\n\nFestivals & Events\n\nMajor celebrations include Chittirai Brahmotsavam, Vaikunta Ekadasi, and the Masi (February–March) Theppam (float festival) in the temple tank  .\n\nThe annual Ramanujar festival is significant—legend says his father performed a Putrakameshti yagna here and received the blessing that Ramanuja would be born  .\n\nSummary\n\nA divine blend of ancient architecture, living tradition, and deep Vaishnava devotion—this temple is high on my list for anyone seeking spiritual depth or historical richness in Chennai. The sight of Meesai Perumal, the serene tank, and the lusciously sweet prasadam make it unforgettable."

The intricate carvings on the pillars and walls tell tales from Hindu mythology, showcasing the exquisite craftsmanship of the Pallava and later Chola and Vijayanagara periods. The vibrant colors of the deities and the constant chanting of hymns create a serene and uplifting ambiance.\n\nWhat truly sets this temple apart is its unique dedication to five forms of Vishnu: Krishna (Parthasarathy), Rama, Ranganatha, Gajendra Varadaraja, and Narasimha. Each shrine is beautifully maintained, allowing devotees to offer prayers and admire the distinct iconography. The main deity, Lord Parthasarathy, with his iconic mustache and scars from the Mahabharata war, is particularly captivating.\n\nThe temple complex is surprisingly spacious and well-organized, making it easy to navigate. Don't miss the opportunity to witness the daily rituals and aarti, which are performed with great devotion and precision. The spiritual energy during these times is palpable.\n\nBeyond its religious significance, the Parthasarathy Temple is a living testament to South Indian heritage. It's a place where history breathes, art flourishes, and faith resonates deeply. Must visit temple in chennai."

There you can see the carving of a monolith rock. The place is nice and beautiful. However, I felt there were lots of people selling food and the place was losing its beauty. There is an entrance to the beach from this place at th back. It is so depressing to see that the whole place is so dirty. Left overs of food and plastic has ruined the place. Too many shops. The beach has lost its charm."

Please do not miss the Arumugam Temple that was excavated and lies just outside the chain fence in the north. The temple is closed off and can be circled. A wonderful discovery. If the gate to that area is closed, one could walk from the beach or from ECR.

But there is no eatery for proper meal. So plan accordingly.\nIf you are interested in such rock cut places or interested in history, it's a good place to visit. Otherwise, it's a ok place for spending 1-2 hours."

One of the highlights of my visit was the 4D VR show, which took us through Swami Vivekananda's powerful and spiritual journey in a truly immersive way.\n\nThe visuals, sound, and storytelling were amazing—it felt like I was walking alongside him through different phases of his life, especially his journey to the West and his speech at the Parliament of Religions in Chicago. It gave me a deeper understanding of his vision, thoughts, and contribution to Indian philosophy.\n\nOverall, it's a must-visit place for anyone interested in history, spirituality, or just looking for inspiration. I left the place feeling motivated and proud of our rich cultural heritage."

I’ve been seeing this place from outside for more than 25 years, since my childhood, as it is close to my grandfather’s house. Whenever I go across Marina, this pink building always stands out and reminds me of its cultural and historical significance.\n\nThough many people visit inside for school trips, exhibitions, or spiritual visits to learn about Swami Vivekananda and experience peace, the outside itself has a charm. Recently, opposite Vivekananda House, they have started putting up a big screen for open-air Tamil movie screenings, where the crowd sits together to watch evergreen films. The atmosphere becomes lively, with nearby stalls selling hot crispy bhajjis, ice creams, seafood like fish and prawn, fried rice, sodas, and popcorn – giving a true Chennai beachside vibe.\n\nThis place beautifully balances heritage and modern leisure – inside for culture and spirituality, and outside for entertainment and food. Truly, Vivekananda House is not just a building but a symbol of Marina itself."

Better to bring your own tshirt, shower cap.\n\nSmall birds park also there. You can feed them.\n\nIf you bring snacks and lunch with you can spend your whole day. It's very hot during this summer, so cap is must.\n\nWe went on weekend only, not much crowded.\n\nWorth for money."

There is alot of improvement required, the water gets dirty and there is so much dirt in the water. The water activities, the balloon seater is less compared to the crowd, you may have to wait a very long time. Bathroom also need improvement, specially the changing room. Most of rides are out of order or not active. Overall it is good to spend the day."

Service felt personal and welcoming.\n\nThe beach access is a real plus, though it depends on tide and weather conditions. When open, it’s perfect for a morning walk or evening stroll.\n\nThe pool, gardens, and open spaces are beautifully maintained and ideal for unwinding.\n\nFood was enjoyable, especially the fresh seafood. The open-air dining setup adds to the experience.\n\nA peaceful retreat. Worth visiting if you’re looking for quiet time by the coast."

The food is absolutely delicious, and overall service is very good.\n\nHowever, there were a couple of drawbacks. The moment you enter the room, there is an unpleasant smell from the toilet, which seems to be a plumbing issue that really needs attention. Also, while the hotel is beachfront, the beach itself isn’t particularly great, so don’t expect that to be the highlight of your stay."

From the moment you arrive, the sound of the ocean and the lush greenery set the tone for a perfect coastal escape.\n\nWhat made it even more special was that it’s pet-friendly! It’s such a relief to find a luxury resort that warmly welcomes pets without compromising on comfort or service. The staff is incredibly warm, and the property is spacious enough for pets to roam freely in a safe, natural setting.\n\nThe cottages and sea-view rooms offer ultimate privacy, and the vibe throughout the resort is calm and rejuvenating—ideal for a break from city life. Whether it’s lounging by the beach, enjoying a spa session, or just soaking in the serenity, this place delivers on all fronts.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking to unwind with their furry companion in a five-star coastal retreat."

I was bit sick and was not able to eat anything when I reached the resort. Just seeing my dull face , Chef John understood I was not ok. His kindness shone through. With a warm smile, he made fresh Idiyappam and coconut milk specially for me and he made yummiest home style curd rice  showcasing a motherly touch that went beyond just cooking. His thoughtful gesture helped me recover quickly and I was all ok by evening. I am deeply grateful for his compassion and thought fullness. I could enjoy my birthday at the resort. Would love to visit again  for the peaceful Private beach and the yummy food and room facilities at the resort . Taj resorts that way hold special place in our hearts .."

The resort was spacious and greenish but the problem is the behaviour of securities. Managers were good but they have north india guys as securities they just treat us like trespassers. Wherever we go they follow us and question us. Only word they were taught was this is only for guest. We understand we might not have access to few places and that can be conveyed in decent way not like this. Management should train the securities to treat people in the equal way though they pay for premium rooms or they pay for party halls. They don't just visit free."

The trainers were incredibly patient and professional. Before heading into the main pool, they spent around 30 minutes training me, helping me get comfortable with the equipment—especially breathing in and out through the mouth, which was a bit tricky at first.\n\nOnce I was ready, diving into the pool surrounded by sharks and bat rays was nothing short of thrilling. It genuinely felt like being in the real ocean, with the presence of these majestic and slightly intimidating creatures all around. It was definitely worth every rupee I spent!\n\nOne of the most fascinating parts was watching the team feed the fishes manually. They carried buckets of fish right up to the sharks and other species, feeding them with such confidence—it was a jaw-dropping sight!\n\nSpecial thanks to Prabhamani from the call center for her fabulous support, and indhu at the Marine Kingdom for being so helpful throughout. The entire scuba team deserves applause for making this a safe and exciting adventure.\n\nHighly recommend this place to anyone looking for a unique underwater experience!"

The highlight is the stunning glass tunnel — it truly feels like walking under the sea. Don’t miss the 15-minute real mermaid show — it’s magical and adds a unique touch to the visit. Great place for families and ocean lovers!\n\n* Totally AC inside\n* Ticket price is a bit on the higher side (₹745 Adult , 645 Kids)\nBut available on discount online."

Every corner feels polished and inviting, which makes it appealing to people of all ages. You can easily spend an entire day here, slowly exploring the exhibits and discovering fish and marine life you’ve probably never seen before.\n\nIt was a peaceful, enriching experience overall.\n\nHighly recommended for families, kids, and anyone looking for a relaxed outing with a touch of wonder!"

The staff clearly told us that the age limit is 10+ for adult karts, and we were 11 and 13 years old, so we thought it was all good. But then they suddenly changed the reason and said we can’t ride because our legs might not reach the brakes, which made no sense – we were clearly tall enough and even tried to show them.\n\nTo make it worse, they gave a kid’s kart to someone else who came after us and didn’t offer us the same option. No explanation, no proper reason. We were just made to sit in the twin kart, which wasn’t what we came for. Felt like straight-up favouritism and very unfair.\n\nWe went there to have fun but ended up feeling disappointed. The karts and track might be good, but the way the staff handled the situation was poor.\n\nNot a great experience – hope they treat all visitors fairly in the future."

Buffet was served in a common area and more than 250+ people will have food with you during your slot. Good that they gave us seating in a row. Food is not good except very few items.. Chicken starter was soo hard. They give a very big menu, but reality it was not sumptuous.\n\n2) Our team was allocated a lawn area for our gathering. Only chair facility was there.

Located right by the beach, the resort offers a peaceful atmosphere, lush greenery, and well-maintained surroundings that make it perfect for a weekend getaway or special occasion.\n\nI recently visited the resort to attend a friend’s wedding held at their marriage hall. The venue was spacious, clean, and very well-organized. The decorations were beautifully done, and the beachside setting added a unique charm to the whole celebration. The staff were courteous and ensured the event ran smoothly.\n\nThe ambiance of the resort is calm and refreshing, with plenty of open space and beach access that makes it ideal for both events and leisure. It's a great place to unwind with family or friends, and also perfect for hosting memorable occasions like weddings or receptions."

The room was spacious and well-appointed, providing a perfect sanctuary after a long day of activities.

We were also impressed with the range of facilities available, including the gym, swimming pool, and spa, all of which contributed to a holistic and rejuvenating stay.\n​The resort's prime location on the Bay of Bengal beach stretch offers breathtaking views and easy access to local attractions. Its proximity to Mahabalipuram and Chennai makes it an ideal choice for both leisure and business travelers. The resort's dedicated banquet facilities also make it a popular venue for events and gatherings.\n​We were particularly impressed by the efficiency and warmth of the front desk staff, who were always ready to assist with a smile. The availability of indoor games added to the recreational options. Overall, The Country Club Jade Beach Resort is a perfect getaway that combines excellent facilities with a serene environment, and we would highly recommend it to anyone seeking a memorable stay."

If only they could maintain the place better, they could be on the way to compete with the big wigs.\nThey served the buffet on the table as the number of people were less. That being said I'd give food a definite 4 stars- 1 star less as nobody is perfect ever.\nThe swimming pool was functional and we spent a considerable amount of time at the pool. The changing rooms require an overhaul. The private beach was good but they could maintain the surroundings better and control the entry of stray cows there.\nThe indoor games area can have better lighting and be beautified a bit more for aesthetics.\nThe children's play area too needs a major overhaul to have the place functional and safe for kids."

Same with the lift — every single time it stopped working, we had to keep calling the operator again and again.\n\nAnd the worst part — during our event, the drainage near the food area was leaking! So unhygienic and disgusting. Honestly, such a horrible experience, totally not worth the money!"

              "reviewText": "Extremely Disappointing Stay – Broken Commitments and Poor Service\n\nWe booked the entire property for a 3-day stay for the destination marriage, expecting a smooth and enjoyable experience based on the management’s commitments. Unfortunately, what we received was far from acceptable and caused significant inconvenience and embarrassment.\n\nDespite booking the entire venue, we were shocked to discover that other guests had also been accommodated, causing major discomfort and overcrowding. The basic promise of daily linen and towel changes was completely ignored—not even a single change happened during our stay. they have only one small lift can accommodate two people at a time, event that also not worked properly.\n\nThe washrooms were in terrible condition: water flow was extremely slow, taps were broken, and faucets didn’t function properly. Even worse, we were denied access to the large swimming pool that was clearly advertised as available for guests.\n\nOne of the most frustrating issues was the complete failure to supply drinking water in the rooms as promised. With 74 rooms booked, not even one refill was done throughout the stay.\n\nThe decoration vendor caused damages, but strangely, we were asked to pay for it by unrelated parties like the green coconut supplier—absolutely unprofessional and unfair.\n\nWe had also requested 3 wheelchairs for a large group of over 200 guests. Only one was provided, despite repeated reminders. We paid ₹60,000 per day for kitchen usage, yet it was poorly maintained, and the drainage area broke down during the event, leading to overflow and a horrible mess.\n\nStaff behavior was another low point—they were outright rude, used foul language in front of guests, and showed no sense of hospitality. Many rooms were dirty, had non-functioning air conditioning, broken power sockets, badly arranged furniture, and unwashed curtains.\n\nTo top it all, they promised 20 safety locks but didn’t hand over a single key. At the end, without delivering any of the promised services, they were aggressive and confrontational about payment.\n\nOverall, this was an extremely disappointing and unprofessional experience. We expected hospitality, but were met with negligence and hostility. Not recommended."

The room was very clean and nicely appointed, and the entire staff was friendly,  courteous, and attentive - from the groundskeepers, to the attendants at the front desk, to the wait staff at the restaurant, to the owners themselves. They even accommodated our evidently unusual fondness for black coffee. :)"

This made our stay extremely uncomfortable and inconvenient.\n\nIt is unacceptable to charge guests for services that are not provided.

The mall features a variety of retail outlets, ranging from national and international brands to local stores, offering everything from fashion and electronics to lifestyle products.\nHowever, it now feels quite outdated, with fewer shops and a somewhat dull atmosphere compared to its earlier days. Recently, VGP opened a kids' play area here, which has added some fresh energy and vibrance to the place. While this is a positive step, the mall still needs more new, attractive stores to truly regain its charm. Overall, it's a decent spot for a quick visit, but it could be much better with some thoughtful updates and modern amenities."

Cold chicken, half the menu not available, and the staff look tired and lost.\n\nThe whole place feels dead. Dirty walls, broken lights, and a weird smell everywhere. Most shops are closed. It feels like an abandoned building, not a mall.\n\nThe theatre is a nightmare. Drunk men were shouting, people were talking loudly on their phones, and others came just to eat and chat. No one watched the movie. No staff to control the mess. The screen and sound were bad too.\n\nThis place is a total waste of time. Feels more like a slum than a mall. Avoid it completely."

You can enjoy the movie in inox but don’t expect any from the mall until the construction is over. Theater was good and popcorn and tea are nice.\n\nUpdate July 2025: fully constructed mall was good. There was fashion jewelry fair when we went and theater was okie. Mall is smaller than others in Chennai but it is new."

As soon as I entered the mall, I was greeted by a vibrant and bustling atmosphere that immediately lifted my spirits. The Inox theater within the mall was a real treat, with its comfortable seating and top-notch sound system providing the perfect setting for an enjoyable movie-watching experience. What impressed me the most was the impeccable architecture of the mall, which seamlessly blended modern design elements with traditional touches, creating a unique and visually stunning space. Additionally, I was pleasantly surprised to find that the parking fee was only 50 rupees, making it convenient and affordable for visitors like me. Overall, my visit to Chennai City Centre was a delightful experience, filled with happy moments and fond memories that I will cherish for a long time.\n\nMy rating was\n\nAmbiance:4/5\nParking:4/5\nHygiene:4/5\nMaintenance:4/5"

Instead, the kids enjoyed a small car ride in front of the mall. Unlike my last visit, I noticed that there are very few shops operating in this mall now, with only the theatre still functioning. However, they still charge ₹40 per hour for car parking, which feels quite high considering the reduced number of shops."

History, Anthropology and children building components of museum are worth visiting.\nA library in the centre of museum is another well maintained spot.\nOverall excellent. Of course,we could see a part of presentations in 3 hours. Full viewing needs almost full day.\nOnly thing, which I found at the ticket counter missing was online mode of payment. In this age of technology, museum management must review mode of online payment at reservation counter in place of cash payment for purchase of tickets"

Unfortunately, the space suffers from poor maintenance. The aesthetics are far from inviting, and the information provided is neither clear nor well-presented, which takes away from the experience. At present, it feels more like a neglected public space than a celebrated cultural landmark. I sincerely hope the government takes steps to revitalize it, perhaps even by collaborating with private partners, so that this treasure can be preserved and appreciated as it truly deserves."

It will take about 4 hours to comfortably leisurely walk around everything and enjoy the exhibits and relax in a lively location between the buildings. I was glad to see paintings by Indian artists (though you can't take pictures in these halls), find a portrait of Gandhi, known from banknotes. I was also interested in watching the recreation of the life of ancient people and, of course, examining the building itself: doors, stained glass windows, roof. I recommend visiting!

Devotees still seek blessings for health.\n\nSage Valmiki and other saints like Bharadwaja, Markandeya, and even the celestial Kamadhenu cow are all connected to this temple’s lore  .\n\nArchitecture & Deity\n\nThe temple sits on about 1 acre, with two grand seven-tiered gopurams on East Coast Road and West Tank Street  .\n\nInside, a large mandapam with 36 intricately carved pillars houses the serene Somaskanda form of Shiva, alongside shrines for Tripurasundari (Parvati), Murugan, Ganesha, Dakshinamurthy, and others  .\n\nThe self-manifested (swayambhu) Shiva Linga, called Palvannanathar, stands facing west — a rarity among Shiva temples  .\n\nVisitor Experience\n\nThe temple exudes a calm, spiritual energy. Devotees come here seeking healing and peace, often taking ritual dips in its sacred tank  .\n\nIt hosts six daily rituals and twelve annual festivals, including Panguni Brahmotsavam and Maha Shivaratri  .\n\nAfter a recent ₹75 lakh renovation (2020 Kumbhabhishekam), the temple is beautifully maintained and vibrant  .\n\nIn summary, the Marundeeswarar Temple is far more than a historic structure — it feels like a living sanctuary of spiritual healing and timeless devotion. A definitive must-visit on Chennai’s temple trail.\n\nA unique feature of the temple is the sacred tree (Sthala Vriksham) under which Lord Shiva is believed to have given darshan. The space around the tree feels calm and spiritually powerful — a perfect spot to sit peacefully for a few minutes.\n\nThe temple is spacious, well-maintained, and offers a serene experience, especially on weekdays. It's a great place to escape from the hustle of the city while still being in the heart of Chennai.\n\nNote: There are a few stray dogs outside the temple premises. They usually stay around the entrance and can be aggressive at times — it's best to stay cautious and avoid approaching them.\n\nA must-visit for anyone seeking a spiritually enriching experience in Chennai.\n\nParking of vechile is available with a cost of 50"

From the outside you won't even know that such a beautiful church exists, as the street outside is very busy and congested and the church's exterior wall and the main entrance may not be easily identifiable.  Even the street vendors outside wrongly directed me to the catholic church nearby when I asked them about the Armenian church!! The place is maintained extremely neat and clean. It is a different feeling when you step inside the compound and as you walk past the main entrance the chaos of the busy city vanishes and you are suddenly transported into a different place altogether like a time traveler!! The place is very calm and quiet unlike the noisy and chaotic streets just outside!!! The caretaker informed that the church is open to all and anyone can come and pray. There is no regular mass at this church. It is maintained by a few Armenian families in Chennai. If you enjoy peaceful and calm places of worship, then this place is a must visit place for you!!!"

              "reviewText": "Chennai International Airport  is one of India’s busiest and most important gateways, especially for travelers heading to and from South India. Located in Tirusulam, about 20 kilometers from the city center, the airport comprises two main terminals: one for domestic flights and another for international travel.\n\nThe airport has seen significant upgrades in recent years, with efforts to modernize its infrastructure and improve passenger experience. The newer sections of the terminal offer better lighting, expanded seating, cleaner washrooms, and improved signage. However, parts of the airport, especially in the domestic terminal, still feel dated and can get overcrowded during peak hours.\n\nIn terms of amenities, the airport offers a decent selection of food outlets, both local and international, as well as a few duty-free stores and lounges. Free Wi-Fi is available, though the connection can sometimes be patchy. Security and immigration processes, while thorough, are known to be slow during busy periods, which can be frustrating for travelers.\n\nConnectivity to the city is fairly good, with options such as taxis, app-based cabs, and a metro station nearby, although the walk from the terminal to the metro could be more convenient, especially with luggage.\n\nOverall, Chennai International Airport is functional and steadily improving. With ongoing expansion projects, it has the potential to become a more efficient and comfortable travel hub in the coming years."

Located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, it holds a special place in the hearts of cricket fans due to its deep-rooted legacy and passionate crowd.\n\nStepping into Chepauk feels like walking into a temple of cricket. The energy is electric, especially during IPL matches when the yellow sea of Chennai Super Kings fans brings the stadium to life. The roar from the stands when MS Dhoni steps onto the field is truly spine-tingling and something every cricket enthusiast should experience at least once.\n\nThe view from the stands is excellent, with well-maintained seating and a layout that gives most spectators a clear view of the action. The upgraded infrastructure and new pavilions have improved the overall comfort and experience. Facilities like clean restrooms, food courts, and accessible entry points make it convenient for families and fans of all ages.\n\nWhat sets Chepauk apart is the knowledgeable crowd. Fans here appreciate the game beyond just boundaries and sixes — even a well-bowled dot ball or a defensive stroke can earn applause. This respect for the sport creates a unique and respectful atmosphere that resonates with players and fans alike.\n\nThe stadium is also easily accessible by public transport and offers a great location close to Marina Beach, making the visit even more enjoyable.\n\nIn short, Chepauk Stadium is not just a place to watch cricket — it's a place to feel cricket. For any die-hard fan, witnessing a match here is nothing short of a dream. The legacy, passion, and pure love for the game make it one of the best stadiums in the country."

The atmosphere is absolutely unbeatable — the sea of yellow, the deafening cheers for Dhoni, and the pure cricket fever make it a one-of-a-kind experience for any fan.\n\nThe stadium itself has a historic vibe and decent facilities. Seating was comfortable enough, though certain stands can get quite hot during day matches. The crowd energy is what makes the place come alive — every boundary and wicket is celebrated like a festival.\n\nEntry and exit were managed decently, though it gets a bit chaotic with the crowd. Snacks and refreshments are available, but a bit pricey and the queues can be long.\n\nOverall, if you're a CSK fan or just love live cricket, this stadium should definitely be on your bucket list. Watching a match here is not just about the game — it’s about being part of the yellow army!"

Water bottles, pens or notepads for even autographs are not allowed (by the way its hard to even see the players from closer quarters). water is available at free of cost inside stadium but its not easily accessible from the stands. Only Coke was available & nothing else on soft drinks and other eatables are costly & quality is not upto the mark. Tshirts & caps are sold near the entry & in station at cheaper rates. Inside stadium after entry flags, whistle & 4s 6s pamplets are given at free of cost. Night view from the stand is way better than afternoon, hardly we were able to see the players face clearly from the distance, may be from a different stand it might be little better. Overall the ambience, crowd chanting & DJ is good but it hardly comes close to the comfort of watching actions closely in a TV with replays. Over hyped costly experience."

Established in 1916, it is the second-oldest international cricket stadium in the country still in use, after Eden Gardens in Kolkata  . The stadium has a seating capacity of approximately 50,000 spectators  . It has witnessed numerous significant cricketing events, including India's first-ever Test victory in 1952 against England and the second-ever tied Test match in cricket history during the 1986 India-Australia series  . The pitch at Chepauk is known to favor spin bowlers, making matches here particularly engaging.  The stadium serves as the home ground for the Tamil Nadu cricket team and the Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League  . Located near Marina Beach, the stadium is easily accessible via public transportation, including the Chepauk MRTS railway station  .

But there are a lot of points of improvement.\n\nThere is only one lift. It is old and slow. A 10 floor building should have a modern and faster lift.\n\nThe space on the top is very narrow. They can accommodate only 20 people max at one time. They give only 10 minutes to enjoy the views.\n\nI had several doubts. Why are they not using other floors to allow people to enjoy the view. If they can only use the top floor, then they should have built it bigger to accommodate more people.\n\nThe idea of a lighthouse is good but execution is very poor. It feels better to have something than have nothing."

Located right on Marina Beach, it gives you one of the best aerial views of the Bay of Bengal. Once you take the elevator up (yes, thankfully no climbing!), you’re greeted with a wide open view of the beach, the sea, and the city stretching far beyond and the sea breeze up there is super refreshing, especially during the evening.\n📸 Tip: Go during sunset for the best experience."

I was stopped at the entrance just for my torn jeans, despite being otherwise dressed appropriately.\n\nA one-time act of kindness or simply allowing someone to step in and inform the family would have shown class and maturity.

Situated in Royapettah, a suburb in the present Chennai India, it was constructed in Indo-Saracenic style in 1798. Amir Mahal has been the residence of the family since 1876. The Nawab’s successor, Mohammed Abdul Ali, and his three brothers still live in the palace with their families. It also has a mini cricket ground which is currently being renovated by the government.\n\nThe Amir Mahal was constructed in 1798 by the British East India Company to house administrative offices of the company. When the Carnatic kingdom was annexed by the Company in 1855 as per the Doctrine of Lapse, the Chepauk Palace which was the official residence of the Nawabs was auctioned off and purchased by the Madras government.\nThe Nawab moved to a building called Shadi Mahal on Triplicane High Road and lived there. However, the British felt that the Shadi Mahal was not a place ‘fit for the residence of the Prince of Arcot’ and granted him the Amir Mahal in Royapettah. Robert Chrisholm was given the task of converting the office building into a palace.\nIn 1876, the Nawab moved in with his family into the Amir Mahal.\n\nThe Amir Mahal has since been the residence of the Nawabs of Arcot."

Established as the Madras Preparatory School on October 15, 1840 and later, upgraded to a high school and then, graduate college, the Presidency College is one of the oldest government arts colleges in India. It is one of the two Presidency colleges established by the British in India, the other being the Presidency College, Kolkata.. At the behest of Sir Thomas Munro, a Committee of Public Instruction was formed in 1826. In 1836, the duties of the Committee were taken over by a \"Committee of Native Education\". The plans drawn up by the Committee did not commend themselves to the Governor of Madras, Lord Elphinstone, who in turn proposed nineteen resolutions which were passed unanimously.[1]\nAs first Principal, the choice of Elphinstone fell on E. B. Powell, a University of Cambridge Wrangler in Mathematics, who accepted the post. Powell reached Mumbai (Bombay) on 20 September 1840 but did not arrive at Chennai (Madras) until 24 November, the journey from Bombay to Madras taking some four weeks. In the mean time, the Committee had invited a Mr Cooper, from the Hoogly College, Kolkata (Calcutta), to carry out the duties of Principal temporarily, at a salary of Rs. 400 a month. Cooper accepted the invitation and came to Chennai (Madras). He and his staff opened Presidency School, a preparatory school, in a rented building in Egmore known as Edinburgh Home on 15 October 1840. Cooper remained in the preparatory school for only a few months. Soon after Eyre Burton Powell's arrival and before the opening of the high school department in April 1841, he returned to Kolkata (Calcutta). The preparatory School was shifted to Popham's Broadway in 1841.[1]\nThe schools grew into Presidency College. When the University of Madras was founded in 1857, Presidency College was affiliated to it.[1]\nIn 1870, the college moved to its present location in Kamaraj Salai, opposite Marina Beach.. One of the best college in Chennai. Most of the Eminent people are studied here"

              "reviewText": "Had a good time visiting the Anna Geology Museum and Vandalur Zoo last Sunday. It's a great place for families and kids to explore and learn about wildlife and geology. The overall experience was enjoyable, and the place is well-maintained.\n\nHowever, since April is quite hot, the walking paths get really exhausting due to the high temperatures. It would be great if more trees and shaded plant areas are added along the way to give some relief from the sun.\n\nOne concern I noticed was a deer that had escaped its enclosure and was eating human-discarded food. While it was surprising to see, it also shows the need for better monitoring and care in the deer section to avoid any risks to the animals or visitors.\n\nOn the positive side, they support both cash and QR code payments, which is very convenient in this digital age. But one important suggestion: there was no clear notice or signage informing visitors that online payment can be done directly through a QR code without standing in the ticket queue. I waited in a long queue only to be told at the counter to scan and book online via WhatsApp chatbot. This needs to be highlighted with proper boards at the entrance to save visitors' time.\n\nDespite these small issues, the zoo offers a rich and diverse experience and is definitely worth visiting. A few improvements can make it even better!"

The place is well-maintained with clean surroundings and clearly marked pathways, making it easy to navigate. The variety of animals is impressive — from majestic lions and playful monkeys to colorful birds and reptiles. Each enclosure is spacious and designed to resemble the animals’ natural habitat, which shows the effort put into their care and comfort.\n\nThe staff were friendly and informative, always ready to answer questions. Educational boards near each enclosure provided useful details about the species, which made the visit not only fun but also very informative.\n\nFacilities like restrooms, food stalls, and seating areas were clean and accessible. It’s a great spot for families, especially children, as it’s both entertaining and educational.\n\nOverall, the zoo offers a perfect balance of conservation, education, and recreation. I’d definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys spending time with nature and wildlife."

The zoo is quite spacious, with a wide variety of animals, making it a great place to spend an entire day.\n\nA few tips for visitors: carry an empty water bottle – there are many refill stations available, and it's best to avoid single-use plastic bottles. The entry fee is ₹200, which feels a bit on the higher side, so better maintenance and organization would be expected at that price.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience. I enjoyed walking around and managed to capture some good pictures of the animals too."

The distance of the entire park is also so large. But the good thing is there are cycles  available on rent. The cost of the cycle is from Rs.30 to Rs.120 (electric cycles are also available). The entry for Zoo ticket is Rs.200 for adults and Rs.50 for children. Even elephants are also staying long distance. The management should improve a lot."

There's plenty of parking available, though do note that parking is chargeable. You can take a ticket either by scanning the QR code at the entrance or by paying at the cash counter.\n\nBefore entering the zoo, there's a strict check NO PLASTIC items are allowed, which is a great initiative for the environment. You’re allowed to bring food and snacks, but only in steel containers, which is especially helpful if you're visiting with kids or adults who prefer home-packed meals.\n\nInside, you can choose how you want to explore the place. You can rent a cycle (battery or manual) or simply walk around if you have the stamina and want to take your time. One of the highlights is the Jeep Safari for the lion visit it’s an AC vehicle and requires a separate ticket.\n\nAt the end of the visit, there's a children’s play area, along with a snacks shop and food court, making it a nice way to wind down after all the walking and exploring.\n\nOverall, it's a well-maintained and family,friendly place perfect for a fullday outing!"

              "reviewText": "Semmozhi Poonga, located in the heart of Chennai near the Government Museum and Egmore Railway Station, was envisioned as a modern urban park celebrating Tamil language and heritage. While the concept is commendable, the overall experience falls short of expectations, warranting a modest 2-star rating.\n\n**Ambience & Aesthetics (2.5/5):**\nThe park is built on reclaimed land that was once a degraded area, and its transformation into a landscaped garden is a step in the right direction. The name \"Semmozhi Poonga\" (Classical Language Park) reflects a noble intent to promote Tamil culture. There are thematic sections dedicated to Tamil literature and poets, along with sculptures and inscriptions. However, the maintenance is inconsistent—patches of dry grass, wilted plants, and unclean water features detract from the visual appeal. The garden lacks the vibrancy and lushness one would expect from a botanical or heritage park.\n\n**Cleanliness & Maintenance (1.5/5):**\nThis is where the park struggles the most. Littering is common, restrooms are poorly maintained, and there’s a noticeable lack of regular upkeep. Some areas feel neglected, with broken benches and faded signage. The fountains and water bodies often appear stagnant or non-functional, which is disappointing given the park’s central location.\n\n**Visitor Experience (2/5):**\nThe park is open to the public and is often frequented by families, students, and elderly visitors looking for a green space in the city. It’s relatively peaceful compared to busier parks, but the lack of engaging activities, play areas for children, or proper seating limits its appeal. Security and lighting are adequate during the day, but it's not recommended to visit after dusk.\n\n**Accessibility & Facilities (2/5):**\nLocated centrally, it's easily accessible by public transport. There’s a nominal entry fee, and security checks are in place. However, facilities like drinking water, clean restrooms, food stalls, and shaded sitting areas are either inadequate or poorly maintained.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSemmozhi Poonga has the potential to be a cultural and ecological gem for Chennai. Unfortunately, poor maintenance, lack of visitor engagement, and inconsistent upkeep bring down the overall experience. With better management and regular care, it could rise to its intended glory. As of now, it’s a decent spot for a quick stroll, but don’t expect a well-groomed or inspiring green space.\n\n**Rating: ★★☆☆☆ (2 out of 5)**\n*Recommended for: Casual walk, cultural curiosity. Not ideal for families or nature lovers seeking a serene environment.*"

Within an hour, while we were at a nearby shop, the place got Crowded—seems like we picked the perfect timing! 📸 Got some good clicks too!\n\nI had visited this beach ages ago, but it has Developed significantly since then. Noticed some great improvements, like a ramp for the physically challenged ♿ and an increase in the number of shops. The beach is full of vibrant energy, with plenty of activities and games to enjoy. 🏖️🎈\n\nCompared to Marina & Pattinapakkam, this place has a unique charm for me—maybe a personal connection, who knows? 😄 Besant Nagar Beach feels quieter, cleaner, and well-organized, making it perfect for a Peaceful walk, reading, or simply enjoying the waves. 🌊✨ Definitely a must-visit spot!"

Don’t expect a well-maintained or lively beach experience—this is more of a local hangout spot with average cleanliness and basic facilities. Not recommended for those looking for a proper beach vacation."

The crocodile are well taken care it's beautiful to visit with family. Tamil nadu government has been taking good care of the place. I visited from Mumbai with my family and it was best memory. People should visit such places for tourism and to know more about animals like crocodile.  Star rating would also fall less for I'm beyond speechless with my visit. Wish to visit them soon.."

Orange juice was perfect with only fresh oranges and enough sugar, the best OJ I ever had. Butter fried prawns were awesome in taste and spiciness. The chicken rolls was good but a bit dry the dipping saw they provided was niche spicy hot sauce and mango saw was nice too. Couldn’t order any main as it was almost 2:45. The waiter nudged us for the last order and we went for the dessert instead of main. We ordered 2 panacotta one with mango and other with pomegranate. I think they used grape jelly instead of pomegranate. But it was too good to not eat, we cleaned it up in a jiffy"

While the prices might be a bit on the higher side, the service is top-notch and truly exceptional. They offer romantic candlelight dinners and even have a special surprise room with beautiful flower and candle decorations, perfect for special occasions. It's a bit pricier at around ₹5,000 with food included, but it's worth it for the experience. Highly recommend for a memorable dining experience!"

Mediterranean, Thai, Italian, oriental - everything is there. It might be a bit intimidating to look at the menu at first but all are in their specific categories\n\nHave ate here a couple of times, and among the many dishes I’ve tried, a few have been stand outs\n\nThe lamb chops - were delicious and tender and smothered in a tasty herby Italian sauce with olives.\nThe mango sauce fish - it was a bit overpowered with the mango sauce but fish was tender and the dish was tasty\nChicken momos - they were pretty good. But the mango dip they came along is a real banger\nPizza - pizza was the first dish I’ve tried here, back when I came here as a really young kid. The taste is still the same. Their pizza has the unique touch to it.\nPumpkin soup - comes with corn and it’s enriched with pepper. Soothes your throat really\n\nLet downs? I remember the ravioli I once ordered in tomato sauce came in a thick blanket of Alfredo. And I can’t handle that much dairy. And the Thai starters platter. The name was fascinating. But it was just three of the most basic oriental fried starters\n\nAnd also The bathroom being located on a different floor only accessible by a very trippy staircase, is one big problem. Hope they look into it.\n\nBut it’s overall a good place. Good food, options and service. Ambience is obviously a plus too"

And this restaurant is in 2nd floor. You got an ample of parking space outside to park your vehicles. And the ambience is good. I would give 3.5/5. And, the service is top notch. They are really making the food quick and serving at our table soon. All the dishes are nice, I specially melted with prawns. Please do try it out and chicken wings is 3.5/5. I wouldn’t say too bad nor too good. It’s moderate. They should work on it to bring in more flavours. Pasta and pizza were good too. And, they have very limited seats. So please reserve a table before going. Overall, it was nice experience eating there. I would definitely recommend this place to hang out with your friends and families. Please do try it out 💯"

Food needs to be improved though. We had Tom yum veg soup, chicken satay, Chong Qing chilli chicken, veg lasagna, Thai curry vegetable, Polla alla cacciatore and honey chilli lotus stem. We didn't like the chicken satay and the peanut sauce given with it and veg lasagna was okayish not that great. Thai curry and the rest of the food was good but all the items were a bit pricey. But the food wasn't that special to make us want to visit again."

Also we can't climb over the bridge if we try that..there is surveillance camera by police. It starts to create warning sound if we go nearby to bridge/ try to climb on it or play in water. Camera is really working because when some school boys climb over bridge camera starts to create beep sound over long time and then police came and warned those school boys. This is same for both weekdays and weekends. Rather than this thing...this place is really nice to visit. It's free to visit this place. 10/08/2025."

You can sit in the outdoors and listen to the waves while you have your meal, pretty calming.\nFood is great. I would recommend to go for the Iranian cuisine since that's their speciality, although they also offer other continental and Indian dishes.\nGuava Barley juice and Shiraz art tea is a must, give it a try, you won't be disappointed.\nI like their hummus, though pita is more like chips, not bread. I have tried all of their veg Iranian dishes and they are absolutely delicious. So are the non veg ones. You can always ask the owners for their recommendation, they are very nice and always keen on suggesting the right thing for you."

And the rice with it was promised to butter rice but there was no butter in that. If you have tried the Chelo Kabab in Peter Cat Kolkata you would be highly disappointed to taste the same in Shiraz Art Cafe. We ordered a chicken starter and another chicken dish... Both were bland hand again the meat was hard and half cooked. One 🌟 for food. Overall giving 3 🌟 for the ambiance and good country music. The restaurant is well decorated and you can spend a lot of time there without any disturbance. Presentation of food was nice. I wish it tasted the same."

There’s a lot to see from life-size rocket models like the GSLV and BrahMos to interactive science exhibits. The 360-degree 3D sphere show was definitely a highlight really immersive and well done. I also found the weighing machine that shows your weight on different planets pretty cool.\n\nThe human evolution section with displays on early humans and Neanderthals was interesting and there were plenty of exhibits covering space chemistry and physics. The outdoor area had some dinosaur models though a few could use some maintenance. There were also some defense and technology exhibits adding to the variety. I noticed another 3D show but I didn’t have time to check it out.\n\nOverall it’s a great place for anyone interested in space and science. Definitely worth a visit especially for students and families"

              "reviewText": "Birla Planetarium is located right in the heart of the city. It’s a quiet place with plenty of parking available in front. The ticket prices are very reasonable – **INR 100 for adults and INR 50 for children** covers the entire package (Planetarium show, entry, 3D show, and Sphere show). There’s also an option to buy a **basic INR 35 ticket** for only the Planetarium show.\n\nThe campus is not very large, so walking inside is easy. At the entrance, you’re greeted by an **old fighter jet (HAL HF-24 Marut)**, an **old steam locomotive**, and a **model of the GSLV rocket**. There’s also an **evolution park (Dinosaur World)**, but unfortunately, like the science and industrial play areas for kids, it isn’t well maintained.\n\nThe **real highlight is inside** – the Planetarium and the Science Exhibition Centre. Clean washrooms are available outside, and there are gift, souvenir, and toy shops inside. Food options are limited to a small snack counter selling tea, coffee, and light snacks, so it’s best to carry your own lunch if you plan to spend the full 5–6 hours here. Do note that food and water bottles are not allowed inside the Planetarium show, but they can be deposited at the front desk.\n\n**Science & Exhibition Centre:**\n\n* **Ground Floor:**\n\n* DRDO Gallery (models of tanks, battle equipment, and Tejas aircraft)\n* Hall of Nuclear Power (detailed displays on nuclear power generation)\n* 3D Show (10-minute dinosaur world movie with 3D glasses – very exciting for kids)\n\n* **First Floor:**\n\n* Oceans Gallery\n* Mirror House (fun for kids with mirror illusions)\n* Indian Space Gallery (models, information on ISRO projects, and a live quiz show)\n* Ramanujan Mathematics Gallery (interactive experiments)\n* Heart Museum (hearts of different animals preserved in jars)\n* Science on a Sphere (visual science show on a spherical display)\n\n**Planetarium Show:**\nThe absolute **star attraction** – a 20-minute immersive journey through space, stars, the Sun, Moon, and other planets. Truly fascinating, especially for children.\n\n✨ **Overall:** Birla Planetarium is highly educational and an excellent place for kids interested in science, space, and technology. While the outdoor exhibits and some galleries could use better maintenance, the Planetarium and Science Centre make the visit absolutely worthwhile."

              "reviewText": "A dream for Seafood Enthusiasts, situated right besides the very coast, with a cozy and delightful ambience especially at the night. This sums Bay View up\n\nTheir speciality for me is the Kovalam Curry. Basically a tangy onion-garlic curry with tamarind and a bit of spice that you can order with any seafood you want- I tried it with fish and prawns. The salty sea-food taste paired beautifully with this flavourful curry.\n\nPair it with their idiyappams, rice and parotta. I’m not a big fan of the Parotta though. It’s a bit on the drier side and I’ve had much better Parotta outside:\n\nThere aren’t too many good veg options, but their veg Kurma is amazing with idiyappam. Otherwise, the veg menu feels not worth it at all for the price. I tried a paneer starter from here which tasted terrible, overly spiced with chutney powder or something like that\n\nBut turn to seafood, the obvious speciality and this place is a banger. They serve full grills of whole fish, crabs, lobsters and prawns and also classic seafood dishes from Fish and Chips to Calamari. Both the Indian and foreign crowd that stay in this Taj will love the offerings.\n\nIt’s a Taj Restaurant so quite obviously it’s priced extremely high. But the food quality is definitely top class too so you can’t complain. The price also accounts for the amazing seaside ambience. The chef is also very hospitable and talked to us in the table.\n\nYou cannot possibly not eat here if you stay in Taj Fisherman’s Cove, or even if you visit the resort for any reason. The highlight of the entire hotel for sure."

They serve proper Italian food and I guess it is run by Italians (i am not completely sure). The menu has a wide variety of choices (Wide would be an understatement). I have tried the starters and main course. And I must say the food was simply amazing and extremely delicious. To be frank i enjoyed every single bite. They have a squid starter and without a second thought I can say that it was the tastiest squid dish i have ever tasted and I would also include it in the list of the best dishes i have ever had. I loved everything that I ordered. They also serve yummy pizzas with a variety of choices . I enjoyed the ambience equally. With all the fairy lights and small huts, it looks beautiful and would be an apt place for a romantic dinner date. Bella ciao is undoubtedly one of the best hotels i have ever been to !!! I would suggest all italian food lovers to please visit this place and enjoy the food and the ambience 😊😊"

History, Anthropology and children building components of museum are worth visiting.\nA library in the centre of museum is another well maintained spot.\nOverall excellent. Of course,we could see a part of presentations in 3 hours. Full viewing needs almost full day.\nOnly thing, which I found at the ticket counter missing was online mode of payment. In this age of technology, museum management must review mode of online payment at reservation counter in place of cash payment for purchase of tickets"

They don't accept any other mode of payment."

Unfortunately, the space suffers from poor maintenance. The aesthetics are far from inviting, and the information provided is neither clear nor well-presented, which takes away from the experience. At present, it feels more like a neglected public space than a celebrated cultural landmark. I sincerely hope the government takes steps to revitalize it, perhaps even by collaborating with private partners, so that this treasure can be preserved and appreciated as it truly deserves."

It will take about 4 hours to comfortably leisurely walk around everything and enjoy the exhibits and relax in a lively location between the buildings. I was glad to see paintings by Indian artists (though you can't take pictures in these halls), find a portrait of Gandhi, known from banknotes. I was also interested in watching the recreation of the life of ancient people and, of course, examining the building itself: doors, stained glass windows, roof. I recommend visiting! Closed on Fridays."

The main building has a whale skeleton and skeletons of other animals and birds. Some insects and snakes are also preserved there."

Although some of the main rides were under maintenance due to recent incidents, the experience was still amazing. A few new rides have been opened, and they were absolutely thrilling. The highlight of our visit was the wave pool — the DJ kept the energy high, and we spent most of our time enjoying the waves and the water rides. Overall, a fun and refreshing day!."

Kids were thoroughly enjoyed riding  and water parks.\n\nFor playing in water games, you have to wear tshirt,  you can bring your own tshirt or  can buy tshirt from there for Rs.100 each. Better to bring your own tshirt, shower cap.\n\nSmall birds park also there. You can feed them.\n\nIf you bring snacks and lunch with you can spend your whole day. It's very hot during this summer, so cap is must.\n\nWe went on weekend only, not much crowded.\n\nWorth for money."

The water activities, the balloon seater is less compared to the crowd, you may have to wait a very long time. Bathroom also need improvement, specially the changing room. Most of rides are out of order or not active. Overall it is good to spend the day."

Our recent visit left us thoroughly impressed, and it's safe to say that this place offers more than just a meal—it delivers an experience.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped in, the setting was nothing short of magical. The soft glow of lights, the rustic yet elegant decor, and the soothing blend of nature with modern comforts set the perfect tone for an unforgettable evening. As luck would have it, the weather played along, with a gentle drizzle adding a poetic touch to our dinner. Opting for outdoor seating under a closed roof, we found ourselves immersed in the rhythmic sounds of the rain—a serene backdrop for the feast that was about to unfold.\n\nThe culinary journey began with piping-hot soups, rich in flavor and crafted to perfection. Each course seamlessly followed, delivering a delightful blend of taste and texture that kept us wanting more. The main course was indulgent yet refined, celebrating fresh ingredients and masterful preparation. And then came the grand finale—dessert. Every bite was heavenly, a perfect ending to an extraordinary meal.\n\nBut what truly set the evening apart was the atmosphere. Dining while watching an intense IPL match, with the sound of rain complementing the cheers and celebrations, was an experience like no other. It was a beautiful contrast—comforting food, a lively game, and nature’s gentle embrace, all blending effortlessly into one unforgettable night.\n\nEast Coast at Madras Square is a place where food meets artistry and ambience enhances every flavor. Whether you're looking for a quiet evening or a lively gathering, this restaurant promises an experience worth cherishing. Highly recommended!"

The table serves for two person but seated 3 people which made the dine in bit uncomfortable. Hand wash for women is not well organised. Place is too louder because tables are quite closer to each other which makes chit chat from one table to another seem quite louder…  do not prefer if you love quiet and calm atmosphere….\nFood is overpriced and some cases it’s priced unjustifiable… individual’s choice for thumps up/down…. Try once…."

Better to avoid during weekends as it will be very crowded with school children coming here for excursion trips and would have to wait a for a long time in queue to attend each and every rides. Water rides are amazing and much more relaxing after the lunch.\n\nIf you are lucky to get tickets during any sale like the Black Friday sale, it's worth the amount.\n\nReducing one star because of the expensive items inside the theme park. A tin of soft drink costing at ₹70 and normal water bottle at ₹30, which ideally is just ₹20 outside."

I don’t think, there is a separate pool for kids & women.\n\nBy evening time there will be a dance floor lightening with few dancers and anyone can go and dance with them if you want."

I advice people to be here @10 am sharp to start early and enjoy all the rides. That too on weekends it is highly crowded and you have to wait at least 30 mins for each ride. Area of this place is not huge to cover it as like queensland. All rides are enjoyable with friends and family. Canteen is available here, no outside foods are allowed here. Prices of food is ok. Quality and quantity also ok. Few rides are really mind blowing and thrilling experience. Water games are always best in MGM. So start early and enjoy all the games till the evening. Auto or cab from here to return home may be very costly. So plan it accordingly."

Kids enjoyed too since it was their first time.\nWater park was also wonderful. Wave poll, rain dance and kids area in the pool were too much fun.

If you have been to Wonderla, this is ten times a downgrade for the high price of a ticket. In terms of dry rides, Queensland is better and cheaper. And don't even ask me about water rides; only one was functional when I went. You can definitely have fun if you go as a gang, but I would personally save up some money and time and visit Wonderla for a fulfilling adventure park fun time with friends."

The parking space is enough to accommodate 2-3 cars, and few bikes at a time.\n\nThe ambience is pleasing and is spacious enough to easily accommodate 50 persons at a time.\n\nThis cafe offers a wide variety of dishes to choose from. And most of them are quite new fused dishes that are hard to find in many other cafes in this city. The time taken to serve the dishes was quite slow, but it is perfect when we either go as a couple (Date) or for a business meeting.\n\nThe taste of most of the dishes were close to perfect and the quantity seemed good for the rates offered. I would highly recommend trying their soups and starters.\n\nA perfect cafe in the city for a date."

The time we visited was particularly pleasant — quiet and undisturbed, with just the soft hum of background music accompanying our conversation and meal. It felt like the space was entirely ours to enjoy.\n\nThe food was exceptional. We started with two types of soup, both rich and creamy with just the right blend of spices and herbs — a comforting and flavorful beginning to our meal. For the main course, we chose a thin-crust pizza which was equally delightful, perfectly baked and generously topped, striking a great balance between texture and taste. The menu offers an impressive variety, ranging from Asian to Continental cuisines, catering to diverse palates.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the tiramisu and tres leches. The tiramisu had a bold coffee flavor, which some may find slightly overpowering, but the tres leches was pure indulgence — light, moist, and full of flavor.\n\nOverall, it was a memorable experience, and this place has certainly earned a spot on our list of favorites. Kudos and heartfelt thanks to the Basil With a Twist team for their warm hospitality and exceptional culinary experience."

The interiors are impressive, with beautiful flooring and AC indoor seating. But the outdoor seating truly shines - surrounded by lush greenery, uniquely designed lamps add a warm glow, and the quirky chairs and tables make it a charming spot. The outdoor seating area feels like a secret garden, perfect for relaxation. The food is exceptional, with standout pizzas, delicious chicken dishes, and mouthwatering desserts. But the real highlight for me was the abundance of friendly cats roaming around - a cat lover's paradise! Definitely worth visiting again and again for the outdoor seating, food, and feline friends!\""

It's located in the heart of the city but the whole area is covered with trees and plants and makes you feel you're somewhere way out of the city.\n\nComing to the food, we ordered one Pesto Fusili pasta with potato and beans and omlette along with iced cappuccinos. Everything were delicious and filling. They have cocktails on the menu as well along with a bakery with a lot of cakes and pastry options.\nOverall a great experience but we felt the price is a bit on the higher side. Will definitely recommend this for a leisurely weekend breakfast/brunch."

It’s a great place for pictures or just to chill for a while.\n\nBut the food and service were a huge letdown.\nWe ordered cold coffee, hazelnut cappuccino, and chicken pizza – none of them were good.\nCold coffee tasted like diluted water, not even cold. The cappuccino had too much froth and lacked flavour. And the pizza? The chicken felt undercooked and totally off.\n\nOn top of that, it’s super expensive, and we literally spent 20 minutes just trying to figure out the menu – nothing was clear and the waiter wasn’t helpful.\n\nMight visit again just for the peaceful vibe, but definitely not for the food."

The service is pathetically slow and the waiter not speaking English and being clueless about what we just said doesn’t help either. There’s a lack of waiters so you can’t even inquire about your order if you need to.\n\nWe waited 1 hour for two pathetic mocktails that weren’t even good. One starter arrived quickly and one dish took 40mins and the other 50mins (in total). Such slow service despite only less than 8 guests at the place. Every single time we told the waiter one thing, he left somewhere on a scooter and took a long time to come back???\n\nIt seems there is a lack of proper organisation and management at this place.\n\nWhich is a shame because the ambience is actually good and the area is peaceful and clean, with ample parking on the street. It’s a nice place to relax. I do wish the table and curtains were clean cause they looked dirty. It’s not that difficult to wash them…\n\nThe food was fine. Nothing to write home about. Pretty average all in all. Half the menu wasn’t available for some reason so our choices were limited.\n\nI would not recommend visiting this place. There are definitely better places in ECR."

From the moment you step in, you're transported into a winter wonderland with real snow, icy slides, and loads of fun activities. The temperature drops instantly, and it’s a refreshing change from the Chennai heat!\n\nThey provide all the necessary winter gear like jackets, boots, and gloves, which are clean and well-maintained. The snow play area is spacious and perfect for families, kids, and even groups of friends. The music, lighting, and overall vibe make it a joyful experience.\n\nThe highlight for me was the snow slide and the snowfall simulation – truly magical moments. Staff were polite, safety measures were in place, and everything was well organized.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a fun, chilly adventure without leaving the city. Perfect weekend getaway or birthday surprise idea too!"

From the moment we stepped in, it felt like being transported to a snowy mountain village — without leaving the city. The snow was real, soft, and fresh, and the temperature was just right to enjoy comfortably with the provided jackets,hand gloves and boots. Also they ensured it’s properly cleaned before giving to next visitor.\n\nThe space is well-maintained, clean, and very safe for families. There are plenty of fun activities like snow slides, snowball play zones, and even mini igloos for the little ones to explore. The staff were friendly, attentive, and made sure everyone was enjoying safely.\n\nOnly key improvement is needed in WASHROOM. Not happy with quality of cleanliness and standards set by VGP Management.\n\nAmple parking space available.\n\nPerfect for just experiencing snow in chennai. Highly recommended for some chilly fun and unforgettable memories!"

It’s a wonderful experience not only for kids but also for builders, architects, or even anyone dreaming of constructing their own home.\n\nSo why only 3 stars? Mainly because of the confusing layout and lack of proper guidance. Some areas are not well maintained—certain buildings and rooms are closed without explanation, while others are being used for storage. Although I was given a pamphlet with a map, it was hardly useful.\n\nFrom the entrance to the exit, there should at least be clear milestones or directional boards. For example: “Start here → Next visit Tamil Nadu House → Exit this way. To visit Kerala House, follow this route,” etc. Without proper instructions, it’s very difficult to fully enjoy and experience the cultural richness and diversity showcased in the museum."

              "reviewText": "I visited Dhakana Chitra Heritage Museum with my family last weekend, and it was one of the most enjoyable and enriching day trips we’ve had in a long time. This place is more than just a museum — it’s a well-planned heritage village that combines cultural learning with a comfortable, family-friendly environment. I’ll share my experience in detail so that it helps anyone planning a visit.\n\n⏰ Timings & Entry\nThe museum is open from morning till evening (usually around 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM), and I recommend arriving as early as possible. We reached around 10:30 AM, which was perfect because the place was less crowded, the weather was cooler, and we could take our time exploring without rushing. The ticket counter staff were friendly and explained the map of the place so we could plan our route. They also mentioned the timings for any live demonstrations happening that day.\n\n🧹 Cleanliness & Maintenance\nOne of the first things I noticed was how incredibly clean and well-maintained the entire place is. The pathways are swept, there’s no litter anywhere, and the gardens are beautifully trimmed. Even the restrooms — something I’m always cautious about when visiting public places — were spotless, with running water, soap, and hand-drying facilities. The traditional houses and displays are also well-kept, with no dust or neglect, which really adds to the pleasant experience.\n\n🍴 Food & Refreshments\nThere’s a small but well-run food court area inside the museum grounds. The menu is simple, offering local South Indian snacks like dosa, idli, vada, and upma, along with fresh juices, coffee, and tea. Prices are reasonable, and the food tastes fresh and homely. We had a late breakfast of masala dosa and filter coffee, and it was delicious. For lunch, there’s a traditional thali option that gives you an authentic taste of local cuisine. There are also cold drinks, bottled water, and ice creams available, which is great if you’re visiting with kids. The seating area is shaded, clean, and surrounded by greenery, so it’s relaxing to take a break here.\n\nArrive early to avoid the afternoon heat and crowds.\n\nWear comfortable shoes because there’s a lot of walking.\n\nKeep a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen handy.\n\nCarry some cash if you want to buy directly from artisans (though the main food court accepts digital payments).\n\nPlan to spend at least 3 hours here — more if you have kids who want to explore every corner.\n\n🏛 Museum Layout & Attractions\nThe museum is designed like a small village, with different sections showcasing heritage from various parts of India. Each house or structure you enter has information boards in English and regional languages, explaining its history and purpose. This makes it easy for both adults and older children to understand and appreciate what they’re seeing\n\n🎭 Cultural Performances & Seasonal Events\nDepending on when you visit, there may be live folk dance or music performances. We were lucky to catch a small folk dance performance in the afternoon, and it really added to the atmosphere. During festival seasons, the museum often has special events, craft fairs, and workshops for kids, so it’s worth checking their calendar before you go.\n\n🌳 Atmosphere & Comfort\nThe entire place has a very peaceful, relaxing atmosphere. Even though there’s a lot to see, it doesn’t feel rushed or crowded. The shaded walkways, occasional benches, and water refill stations make it easy to take breaks. There are plenty of trees and open spaces, so it’s never stuffy.\n\nIf you’re into photography, the museum is a paradise — every corner is photogenic, from the colorful doors to the hand-painted walls and traditional artefacts\n\n🛍 Shopping for Souvenirs\nNear the exit, there’s a gift shop selling authentic handicrafts, postcards, and handmade toys. Prices are fair, and the quality is much better than what you’d find in typical tourist markets. We picked up a couple of hand-painted wooden keychains and a small terracotta pot — perfect as reminders of our visit"

Every dish we tried was delicious, and there was nothing to complain about. While the ambience is quite simple, the food makes it totally worth it. If you love South Indian non-veg food, this place is a must-try at least once.\n\nOur experience at Sorgam was pleasant—the food was served quickly, and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. I visited with my cousins, who love non-veg food, and they absolutely enjoyed it. As a vegetarian, I was happy to see a good selection of dishes for us as well. Their Thali is perfect for sharing between two people. The unique display of starters before ordering is a great touch, making it easier to choose what to try. Definitely a place worth visiting!"

There is also skating park for kids.\n\nThe shops are clean and as it’s weekday not all shops opened. Overall a must visit beach in Chennai. Don’t miss this even if u miss Marina beach."

The beach is clean, the atmosphere is calm, and the streets nearby are filled with amazing street food that adds to the charm. The park area with its various rides is also worth exploring and makes the visit even more enjoyable. The only drawback is the presence of persistent beggars and vendors, which can be bothersome, so it’s good to stay cautious. Other than that, Besant Nagar Beach is definitely a must-visit destination in Chennai."

I’ve been visiting it regularly – both early in the mornings and late at night, and each visit has something special to offer.\n\n🌅 Sunrise at the beach is a serene and beautiful experience. The soft golden light, the gentle sound of waves, and the cool breeze instantly lift your mood. It’s the perfect time to go for a peaceful walk or just sit by the shore and soak in the calmness before the city wakes up.\n\n🌇 Sunset, on the other hand, brings its own charm. The sky turns into a canvas of oranges and pinks, and the atmosphere becomes livelier with people strolling, kids playing, and street food vendors lighting up the beachside. There’s something so refreshing and calming about the place, no matter what time of day it is. The moment you step onto the sand, you feel a sense of peace and lightness that only the sea can bring.\n\n🎉 One of the exciting things about Bessie is that they screen IPL matches on big screens during the season! It adds a vibrant community vibe, with people cheering, relaxing with friends and family, and enjoying snacks while watching the game in the open air with the sea breeze around.\n\nWhether you’re looking for quiet reflection during sunrise, chilling with friends in the evening, or even just grabbing a bite from the food stalls, Besant Nagar Beach never disappoints. It’s clean, lively, and safe, and has become a sort of personal escape zone for me within the city.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone visiting Chennai or even locals who haven’t made this part of their regular routine yet!"

Whether you visit at dawn, when the sky blushes softly, or in the evening under the moonlit glow, the place feels magical. The waves are lively but soothing, and the breeze carries that unmistakable salty freshness.\n\nThere’s a lively stretch near the shore with small stalls, local snacks, and the hum of people enjoying themselves, yet you can always find quieter corners to just sit and watch the ocean. The beach is perfect for long walks, photography, or simply letting time slow down while the waves kiss your feet.\n\nIf you’re in Chennai, Basant Nagar Beach isn’t just a spot—it’s an experience. 🌊✨"

So go with some safety precautions when u r going alone (Boys/Girls).\n\nWhen you are going in groups you can enjoy.\n\nTransportation : You have to take auto from the main road for around 1.5kms to reach this place, you will get autos frequently from bus stop to the destination but while return either u have to book auto or you have to walk."

Kalaignar Centenary Park is perfect for an evening stroll, with wide walking paths, lush lawns, and colourful flower beds. The landscaping is impressive, and the fountains add a refreshing touch. It’s clean, family-friendly, and has plenty of seating areas to relax. Best to visit in the early morning or evening to avoid the heat. A great spot to unwind amidst the city hustle. Entry fee 200 per adult and few attractions also charged separately (Zip line, glass house, bird food feeding, musical fountain, kids play area, toy train, etc)\nRestrooms are neat and well maintained.\nCar parking available across the road near Semmozhi park."

You can either book the tickets through online or you can take the tickets directly through QR code scanning. Entry ticket is 100 rs. Each and every event is charged here. So you can take a call after getting in to this place. You can pay separately for each event like zip liner, birds watching and feeding, glass house, music fountain, bamboo house and other events. Birds feeding is very costly here 500 rs, which will abort your wallet. People just take the entry fee for birds watching and they keep the spilled foods on their hands. Birds will come and take the food from ur hands. This is one of the cost cutting trick people do here. Canteen is available here and outside food is not allowed. Canteen provides only like snacks and drinks. You cannot expect any kind of meals here. Milk shakes, donuts, puffs, and other snacks items only available, but I feel food rates bit costlier and this is run by the physically challenged. People. The amount that we spend here goes for good cause. You can spend around 2 to 3 hours if you want to enjoy all the events otherwise it is just an hour. Parking is available in Semmozhi Poonga. Weekends it will be crowded always. Weekdays not much people, so it is good for the road side Romeos and Juliets to enjoy the time without any disturbance. I recommend to start from home in the afternoon time to reach the place between 3.30 to 4 pm. So you can enjoy all the events including the musical fountain, which will be opened in the evening only. You can enjoy and spend valuable time with ur family and friends. Weekends and public holidays are highly crowded. Monday is holiday."

Great for kids and adults—there’s loads of deer and birds to see, and the whole place is really green and spacious. You can just sit around, play games, or have a simple picnic without feeling crowded. It’s way nicer than being stuck inside the city. If you’re up for some easygoing time in nature, totally check it out!"

Toilets and drinking water facilities are available in many places, and surprisingly, they are clean and easily accessible. However, I feel there’s a lack of animals—only a few can be seen here. Other than that, it’s a great place for kids to spend their day. The only downside is that food and snacks inside are a bit costlier compared to outside.\n\nPrice Details:\nAdult - ₹60\nBelow 5 Years - Free"

The huge bird cage which is the star attraction could have been a walk-in structure like other world class zoos and could also do with a flowing water feature given that most of the birds are aquatic. My son really liked the place"

Its establishment marked a significant moment in the history of modern spirituality, aiming to promote universal brotherhood, study ancient religions, and explore the underlying truths of existence.\n\nUnder the influence of Blavatsky, the society expanded internationally, with the Adyar headquarters in Chennai becoming a pivotal center for theosophical study and practice. This rich legacy continues to inspire individuals seeking spiritual growth and understanding.\n\nThe architecture of the main buildings is striking, showcasing a blend of traditional Indian and European styles. The intricate designs and thoughtful layout reflect the society's commitment to fostering a sense of peace and harmony.\n\nOne of the most noteworthy structures is the headquarters, which houses a library rich in esoteric literature, making it a haven for those interested in spiritual texts and theosophical teachings. The library is not just a repository of books; it serves as a gathering place for discussions, workshops, and lectures, drawing individuals from diverse backgrounds who share a common interest in spirituality and philosophy.\n\nAs you wander through the grounds, you may come across several shrines and memorials dedicated to prominent figures in theosophy. These sites are imbued with a sense of reverence, inviting visitors to pause and reflect on the teachings and legacies of those who have contributed to the society's mission. The peaceful atmosphere is often enhanced by the sound of birds chirping and the rustle of leaves, making it an ideal spot for meditation or quiet contemplation.\n\nThe Theosophical Society also hosts various events, including lectures, seminars, and cultural programs that are open to the public. These gatherings provide an opportunity for individuals to engage with thought-provoking ideas and connect with like-minded people. The society's commitment to universal brotherhood and the exploration of spiritual truths resonates throughout its activities, fostering a sense of community and belonging.\n\nThe Theosophical Society is not only a hub for spiritual and philosophical exploration but also home to one of the largest banyan trees in India. This magnificent tree, which is estimated to be over 100 years old, spreads its branches wide, creating a natural canopy that offers a cooling shade and a sense of peace. The banyan tree serves as a symbol of longevity and resilience, reflecting the society's enduring mission and its deep roots in spiritual inquiry.\n\nVisitors often find themselves drawn to this majestic tree, using it as a serene spot for meditation or quiet reflection. Its expansive network of aerial roots and branches creates a unique and enchanting atmosphere, making it a popular backdrop for photographs and a favorite gathering place for those seeking solace amidst nature. The presence of such a magnificent tree enhances the overall beauty of the society's grounds, contributing to the tranquil environment that encourages introspection and connection with the natural world.\n\nAccessibility is another notable aspect of the Theosophical Society. Located in a bustling locality Adyar, it is easily reachable by public transportation, making it a convenient destination for both locals and tourists.\n\nWhether you are seeking knowledge, peace, or simply finding a beautiful place to unwind yourself, the Theosophical Society is a remarkable sanctuary that invites exploration and reflection, leaving a lasting impression on all those who visit."

              "reviewText": "In a mysterious and serene forest-garden in the heart of Adyar, along the river banks lies the Theosophical Society of Chennai. Built on three main principles, this society seeks universal brotherhood without distinction on race, gender, creed or any other factor. Delve into their gorgeous gardens, teeming with flaura and fawna and you will assuredly have quite a remarkable evening. Those who love reading and learning about new ideologies and life philosophy, will find this Society especially interesting, though the library is off limits to tourists.\n\nIf you step out onto the garden outside, the sounds of woodpeckers, parakeets, cuckoos and sparrows singing and trilling will greet your ears. Small animal species that are unique to the city can be seen scurrying around in the grass and playing in the trees. You can spot jackals and mongoose, as well as other small animals. The main attraction is a huge, 450 years old Banyan tree, supposedly the oldest in the world, with roots covering up to 60,000 square meters. Strolling through the garden is extremely peaceful, away from the chaos of the city and little shrines can be found throughout. Peace will engulf you as you study nature at its calmest, so be sure to take your time and appreciate all the beauty around you.\n\nThe main ideologies of the Society are;\n\nTo form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or color.\n\nTo encourage the study of Comparative Religion, Philosophy and Science.\n\nTo investigate unexplained laws of Nature and the powers latent in man."

The gopuram is stunning with its intricate carvings – you can spend quite some time just admiring the details. Inside, the temple has a very peaceful atmosphere despite being busy most of the time. the chants and lamps made it feel even more spiritual.\n\nThe area around the temple is also lively with small shops and traditional food stalls, which adds to the charm. Parking can be a bit tricky, and the crowd is usually heavy, but that’s expected at such a famous temple. If you’re in Chennai, this is definitely a must-visit, both for the architecture and the divine experience."

Whenever I visit chennai i make sure to go to this temple the aura the architecture the sculpture and the serenity of this hindu temple attracts me so much. Like Gorakhpur temple of UP here also I saw lots of idols of sadhus . Photography of idols is prohibited. This time i visited the temple early morning around 5 am still I could see good number of devotees there.  If visiting Chennai must go to kapaleshwar temple for darshan."

              "reviewText": "Kapaleeshwarar Temple, Mylapore — a classic Chennai landmark that feels timeless the moment you pass the towering gopuram. The nadaswaram and tavil during puja, the fragrance of jasmine and camphor, and the bustle around the temple tank create a beautiful, old-Madras vibe. Darshan usually moves smoothly; priests are courteous and the premises are kept clean with clear signboards and organized footwear counters. Visit early morning or around the evening aarti for cooler weather and fewer crowds (festival days—especially Panguni Peruvizha/Arubathimoovar—get packed). Dress modestly; photos are fine in the outer prakarams but avoid the sanctum. Parking is easiest around the tank streets.\n\nSecret tip: after offering at Karpagambal’s shrine, step to the Punnai (temple) tree and look up—you’ll spot carvings and imagery of the peacock tied to the temple’s legend. At sunset, walk the tank’s east side for the best reflection shot of the gopuram."

Idols of 108 Nayanmargal around Mulavaru gives you the divine vibe . Must visit in weekdays as it is lightly crowded even on Friday odd hours . Definitely in weekends or in special occasions temple will be heavily crowded . Must visit Temple OM NAMAH SHIVAYA 🙏"

It could be a comforting nook for you amidst a hustle and bustle of the city life. Tea was way better than coffee. Coffee beans they are using are a wee bit on an acid and stronger side with no delicate notes of nuts or chocolate. I recommend main courses and some side menus."

Ground floor has women's boutique and first floor has a men's wear section, women's jewellery and cafe. The cafe itself has two partitions. One with beautiful chairs and meant for a date brunch or casual meetings. The second section is more cozy with books lined on shelves and cushioned chairs and sofas. Pick any book you like, read for how ever long you want. Their selection of breakfasts and coffees are definitely worth more visits. Hosts and servers are friendly and helpful with any queries about the menu. The waiting time is fairy short in the mornings but lunch rush will have you waiting for at least twenty minutes. But it's worth all the waiting.\nDefinitely hungry to try more dishes!"

I have a very mixed opinion in food, yes it is overpriced and veg pizza was way too cheesy, sea food pizza was too bland. Only the arabiata pastas were enjoyable but also with extra tanginess. Dessert varieties are as same as wild garden cafe and the taste was 👌🏻. Luxury with a very very average dining and unresponsive service; Keeping the restrooms and washrooms downstairs did not feel very hospitable. Couldn't recommend for a good meal."

They do have private cabana which you need to pay extra.\n\nThey have limited menu. We ordered Persian kebab, Loaded nachos and Fish tikka for starters. Followed by Fungi pizza and Chicken tikka pizza. They do serve alcohol and mocktail. The food was really good especially loved their Persian kebab. It was cooked to perfection. I felt quantity is bit less for the price tag. The service by Abhijit and Manikandan was excellent. We also had little chat with Chef Mr.Ashok post dinner. The staffs were so polite! You can have some quality time with your loved ones here."

Negatives- we were asking for a table in the upper deck and it was not given as it was reserved for regulars, we booked through dine out app and it said it was 30% of the total bill including alcohol but we had to pay alcohol bill separately- so is it a marketing gimmick from both parties?

Aam cigars, bharwan aloo can be slightly better. The accompaniments were especially extremely nice and better such as tamarind chutney, mint chutney, garlic mayo etc. The servers gets extremely busy in rush hour, which makes the service comparatively slow which shojld be streamlined. Thr major problem is the light attracted bugs, which sometimes gather around the table lamp and thus poses a threat to fall on the food items."

But they never told us that we could reserve a table with a good view. If given the option I would have. Only if I knew. We reached on time and was shown a table. Not bad view but If they had told me I would have taken a table with better view. What's going to a roof top without a great view?.\nThis restaurant has both Italian and Northindian limited menu. Not anything listed out of the menu is done here.. Small tables with a battery powered egg shaped LED lamp. The ambience is great and it's breezy. Also there are a lot of mosquitoes. So make sure to wear full sleeves and full pants.\nThe music is loud but pleasant. We were given a menu. Also we can scan a QR for menu. There is also a separate alcoholic beverage menu.\nWe ordered Paneer EKhas for the starter. It's a regular paneer tikka. Paneer was succulent, soft. It was mildly spiced and tasted lovely. The ginger chutney and mint chutney along with paneer tikka was so heavenly that we ordered it again.\nWe ordered main course and it came after an hour. Really after 1 hr. I'm not joking.\nFor main course we ordered Cheese & Butter naan and Bharwan paneer Makhanwala.\nThe Naans were average. Not very soft or very fresh.\nThe paneer gravy is the worst I have ever had in my years of life of loving Paneer Butter masala. Don't be  fooled by the soft paneer starter. The paneer in the gravy was hard, chewy and stale and the gravy tasted so yucky that we didn't want to have any more of it. We didn't want to pack it and bring it either despite it costing Rs700 + tax. Those of you want to eat, order at your own peril. Or you may need to discard it after the first serving.\nPenne e verdure di stagione is a Penne white pasta. It was cheesy and subtly spiced and tasted good but over time when it became colder it started to lump together and became very chewy. Secondly no seasoning was offered for the pasta. We wanted to ask for seasoning but all the waiters were very busy. Already it was late and we didn't want them to delay things much.\nThere was a surprise cake for us as we talk them that it was our anniversary. Cake too was too soaked in sugar syrup and didn't excite our taste buds.\n\nOn the whole the bill was RS. 4078 which included a 6% service charge\n\nPros : Hospitality and Ambience\nCons : Food and Not letting us knew that we could book a table with view\n\nWill I return?. No. Never until they get the paneer gravy right."

Unlike many of the more crowded and commercialized beaches in the city, this beach stands out for its good hygiene and well-maintained surroundings.\n\nThe ambiance is particularly pleasant — peaceful and scenic, especially after 7 PM when the crowd thins out and the entire place takes on a calming, almost meditative vibe. It's a great spot for anyone looking to unwind, reflect, or just enjoy the gentle sea breeze without much noise or chaos.\n\nOne of the biggest highlights is the sense of safety here. Even at night, the beach is safe to visit, thanks to the regular police presence.Thuruvanmiyur beach offers a cleaner, quieter, and more peaceful alternative to the usual Chennai beaches. Whether you're a local or a tourist, it’s definitely worth adding to your list."

Unlike the crowded and noisy cityside beaches like Marina beach, but this place feels calm and relaxing. What makes it better is ,the regular police patrols visiting the beach , even at 2 AM! I once went there with friends to celebrate a birthday late at night, and the police politely advised us to leave for safety. It showed the genuine care, where I heard some harsh words from other police’s for these kind of activities.Big respect to Thiruvanmiyur police for handling things so responsibly. The beach is also super clean and they also work hard and doing regular maintenance with tractors and workers. Sadly, some people still litter. If stricter action is taken, the beach could stay even more beautiful and green."

A good place to go for a walk, relax, solo photography or couple shoots or just soak up the sun but you cannot swim as it is prohibited because the undercurrent is very turbulent.

The air is fresh and crisp, carrying the mild scent of the sea. The beach is peaceful, Walking barefoot on the cool, damp sand feels grounding. Feel perfect to relax, reflect, or simply enjoy the serene beauty of nature.\nThere are a lot of shops which shows that evening should be very vibrant."

They don't accept any other mode of payment."

              "reviewText": "The Government Museum in the heart of central Chennai is a fascinating place, home to an impressive yet often overlooked collection of history and culture. Unfortunately, the space suffers from poor maintenance. The aesthetics are far from inviting, and the information provided is neither clear nor well-presented, which takes away from the experience. At present, it feels more like a neglected public space than a celebrated cultural landmark. I sincerely hope the government takes steps to revitalize it, perhaps even by collaborating with private partners, so that this treasure can be preserved and appreciated as it truly deserves."

It will take about 4 hours to comfortably leisurely walk around everything and enjoy the exhibits and relax in a lively location between the buildings. I was glad to see paintings by Indian artists (though you can't take pictures in these halls), find a portrait of Gandhi, known from banknotes. I was also interested in watching the recreation of the life of ancient people and, of course, examining the building itself: doors, stained glass windows, roof. I recommend visiting! Closed on Fridays."

              "reviewText": "The Thousand Lights Shia Mosque, situated on Peter's Road in Royapettah, Chennai, stands as one of the city’s most iconic and historic religious landmarks.\n\nIts origins trace back to the early 19th century when Nawab Umdat-ul-Umrah of the Wallajah dynasty commissioned its construction on land previously used by Shia Muslims as a gathering place, especially during the month of Muharram.\n\nThe mosque derives its evocative name from the tradition of illuminating its vast prayer hall with a thousand oil lamps, creating a mesmerizing spectacle that has become part of local legend.\n\nArchitecturally, the mosque is a striking example of Indo-Islamic design, featuring multiple domes and tall minarets that rise prominently above the bustling Anna Salai area.\n\nThe main prayer hall is spacious and adorned with Quranic inscriptions, while separate areas are designated for men and women. The mosque complex also includes a Dargah dedicated to Imam Hussain (Raziyallahu Anhu), the revered grandson of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ, further enhancing its spiritual significance for the Shia community.\n\nThe Thousand Lights Mosque is not only a vibrant center for daily worship but also a focal point during Muharram, when thousands gather to commemorate the martyrdom of Imam Hussain. The atmosphere during these observances is solemn, with the mosque beautifully lit and filled with the sounds of prayer and reflection.\n\nVisitors are welcomed, provided they dress modestly and observe the decorum expected in a place of worship. The mosque’s central location makes it easily accessible, and it remains open from early morning until late evening, inviting both devotees and those interested in its history and architecture to experience its unique ambiance.\n\nBeyond its religious functions, the mosque is a symbol of Chennai’s pluralistic heritage and serves as a reminder of the city’s deep-rooted connections to diverse faiths and traditions. Its enduring presence, historical roots, and architectural grandeur make it a must-visit for anyone seeking to understand the cultural and spiritual fabric of Chennai."

Though the name is Thousand lights mosque, it was a custom in the British era to lighten the mosque with oil lamps when electricity was not available.\nPossibly only one lamp can be seen now ( not quite sure) which might be used in that period.\nCast iron columns and  connecting design (that also of cast-iron) tie with huge bolts and nuts can make a visitor feel the actual weight of each part of interior.\nDomes are also in good shape and attractive.\nNo fees.\nBetter to take permission from the caretaker before going in."

Established in 1890 and opened to the public in 1896, it was named after Lord Connemara, the then Governor of Madras.\nI remember visiting as a 8 year old when the upkeep of the library was not so good. When i visited recently, i was pleasantly surprised to see how well the library is maintained, along with air conditioned reading rooms. If you need a quiet place to settle down and read, look no further."

The entry fee of ₹75 for adults feels overpriced considering the current condition.\n\nThe garden might look beautiful during specific flower festivals, but on regular days it lacks proper upkeep and does not justify its reputation. Needs much better maintenance to truly match the expectations set for a botanical attraction."

              "reviewText": "Semmozhi Poonga, located in the heart of Chennai near the Government Museum and Egmore Railway Station, was envisioned as a modern urban park celebrating Tamil language and heritage. While the concept is commendable, the overall experience falls short of expectations, warranting a modest 2-star rating.\n\n**Ambience & Aesthetics (2.5/5):**\nThe park is built on reclaimed land that was once a degraded area, and its transformation into a landscaped garden is a step in the right direction. The name \"Semmozhi Poonga\" (Classical Language Park) reflects a noble intent to promote Tamil culture. There are thematic sections dedicated to Tamil literature and poets, along with sculptures and inscriptions. However, the maintenance is inconsistent—patches of dry grass, wilted plants, and unclean water features detract from the visual appeal. The garden lacks the vibrancy and lushness one would expect from a botanical or heritage park.\n\n**Cleanliness & Maintenance (1.5/5):**\nThis is where the park struggles the most. Littering is common, restrooms are poorly maintained, and there’s a noticeable lack of regular upkeep. Some areas feel neglected, with broken benches and faded signage. The fountains and water bodies often appear stagnant or non-functional, which is disappointing given the park’s central location.\n\n**Visitor Experience (2/5):**\nThe park is open to the public and is often frequented by families, students, and elderly visitors looking for a green space in the city. It’s relatively peaceful compared to busier parks, but the lack of engaging activities, play areas for children, or proper seating limits its appeal. Security and lighting are adequate during the day, but it's not recommended to visit after dusk.\n\n**Accessibility & Facilities (2/5):**\nLocated centrally, it's easily accessible by public transport. There’s a nominal entry fee, and security checks are in place. However, facilities like drinking water, clean restrooms, food stalls, and shaded sitting areas are either inadequate or poorly maintained.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nSemmozhi Poonga has the potential to be a cultural and ecological gem for Chennai. Unfortunately, poor maintenance, lack of visitor engagement, and inconsistent upkeep bring down the overall experience. With better management and regular care, it could rise to its intended glory. As of now, it’s a decent spot for a quick stroll, but don’t expect a well-groomed or inspiring green space.\n\n**Rating: ★★☆☆☆ (2 out of 5)**\n*Recommended for: Casual walk, cultural curiosity. Not ideal for families or nature lovers seeking a serene environment.*"

You can just go alone by yourself, sit in the silence and pray, you'll find your inner peace for sure.\nAnd the staff there are helpful and kind as well. Great place for a visit when you're in Chennai."

We went to beach for sunset but couldn’t stand the place so started walking back to this church. God is good, we did not expect the lightings on this church but it was so beautiful. There was service going on in the sanctuary, although we didn’t understand the song, but the music was so calming. The night temperature was pleasant too, praise the Lord!"

Built over the tomb of St. Thomas the Apostle 🕊️—one of the 12 Apostles of Jesus—this Basilica is one of only three churches in the world built over an apostle’s tomb, alongside St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome and Santiago de Compostela in Spain 🌍.\n\nAt the ground level, there is a small but meaningful museum 🎨 displaying relics and items related to St. Thomas and the history of Santhome. You can see the lance head 🗡️ that pierced him, a rare bone fragment 🦴, his chair, stone receptacle, ancient coins 🪙, Persian medallions, monograms, multilingual inscriptions, and beautiful canvas paintings 🖼️. Each exhibit is well-described with explanatory plaques for context 📖.\n\nAbove the museum, there is a mini theatre 🎥 that screens a short documentary on St. Thomas and the history of the Basilica—informative and spiritually enriching.\n\nOne of the main attractions is the image of Our Lady of Mylapore 👑. This beautifully carved, three-foot-high wooden statue represents Our Lady seated in prayer. Believed to have been brought by Fr. Gaspar Coelho in 1543, this is the oldest and most beautiful statue of Our Lady in eastern India 🌹.\n\nThe Basilica is known for its daily services and peaceful ambiance 🌸. The church offers Holy Masses in both Tamil and English, making it accessible to all.\n\n📅 Mass Timings:\n\nWeekdays: 🕕 05:45 AM – Adoration & Rosary\n🕡 06:15 AM – Holy Mass (English)\n🕚 11:00 AM – Holy Mass (Tamil – Tomb Chapel)\n🕠 05:30 PM – Benediction\n🕕 05:45 PM – Rosary\n🕡 06:15 PM – Holy Mass (Tamil)\n\n🕯️ Eucharistic Adoration (Mon–Sat): 07:00 AM to 05:30 PM\n\nSundays: 🕕 06:00 AM – Holy Mass (Tamil)\n🕖 07:15 AM – Holy Mass (English)\n🕣 08:30 AM – Holy Mass (Tamil)\n🕙 10:00 AM – Holy Mass (English)\n🕦 11:30 AM – Holy Mass (English)\n🕠 05:30 PM – Holy Mass (English – Tomb Chapel)\n🕕 06:00 PM – Holy Mass (Tamil) followed by Benediction\n\n🕊️ Historical Note: Pope St. John Paul II visited this Basilica in 1986—the first ever papal visit to India. His presence added to the sanctity and global recognition of this holy site 🙌.\n\nWhether you are visiting for prayer, history, or peace, this place touches your soul ❤️. Highly recommended for all ages and backgrounds 🌟 n"

The crocodile are well taken care it's beautiful to visit with family. Tamil nadu government has been taking good care of the place. I visited from Mumbai with my family and it was best memory. People should visit such places for tourism and to know more about animals like crocodile.  Star rating would also fall less for I'm beyond speechless with my visit. Wish to visit them soon.."

It's very kid-friendly with safe pathways and informative signboards. Apart from the crocodiles, we also got to see turtles, tortoises, snakes, and a variety of other reptiles. The enclosures were spacious and thoughtfully designed, allowing for a close and safe view of the animals. It’s both fun and educational—highly recommended for kids and adults alike!"

The gopuram is stunning with its intricate carvings – you can spend quite some time just admiring the details. Inside, the temple has a very peaceful atmosphere despite being busy most of the time. the chants and lamps made it feel even more spiritual.\n\nThe area around the temple is also lively with small shops and traditional food stalls, which adds to the charm. Parking can be a bit tricky, and the crowd is usually heavy, but that’s expected at such a famous temple. If you’re in Chennai, this is definitely a must-visit, both for the architecture and the divine experience."

Whenever I visit chennai i make sure to go to this temple the aura the architecture the sculpture and the serenity of this hindu temple attracts me so much. Like Gorakhpur temple of UP here also I saw lots of idols of sadhus . Photography of idols is prohibited. This time i visited the temple early morning around 5 am still I could see good number of devotees there.  If visiting Chennai must go to kapaleshwar temple for darshan."

The nadaswaram and tavil during puja, the fragrance of jasmine and camphor, and the bustle around the temple tank create a beautiful, old-Madras vibe. Darshan usually moves smoothly; priests are courteous and the premises are kept clean with clear signboards and organized footwear counters. Visit early morning or around the evening aarti for cooler weather and fewer crowds (festival days—especially Panguni Peruvizha/Arubathimoovar—get packed). Dress modestly; photos are fine in the outer prakarams but avoid the sanctum. Parking is easiest around the tank streets.\n\nSecret tip: after offering at Karpagambal’s shrine, step to the Punnai (temple) tree and look up—you’ll spot carvings and imagery of the peacock tied to the temple’s legend. At sunset, walk the tank’s east side for the best reflection shot of the gopuram."

Idols of 108 Nayanmargal around Mulavaru gives you the divine vibe . Must visit in weekdays as it is lightly crowded even on Friday odd hours . Definitely in weekends or in special occasions temple will be heavily crowded . Must visit Temple OM NAMAH SHIVAYA 🙏"

              "reviewText": "Had a good time visiting the Anna Geology Museum and Vandalur Zoo last Sunday. It's a great place for families and kids to explore and learn about wildlife and geology. The overall experience was enjoyable, and the place is well-maintained.\n\nHowever, since April is quite hot, the walking paths get really exhausting due to the high temperatures. It would be great if more trees and shaded plant areas are added along the way to give some relief from the sun.\n\nOne concern I noticed was a deer that had escaped its enclosure and was eating human-discarded food. While it was surprising to see, it also shows the need for better monitoring and care in the deer section to avoid any risks to the animals or visitors.\n\nOn the positive side, they support both cash and QR code payments, which is very convenient in this digital age. But one important suggestion: there was no clear notice or signage informing visitors that online payment can be done directly through a QR code without standing in the ticket queue. I waited in a long queue only to be told at the counter to scan and book online via WhatsApp chatbot. This needs to be highlighted with proper boards at the entrance to save visitors' time.\n\nDespite these small issues, the zoo offers a rich and diverse experience and is definitely worth visiting. A few improvements can make it even better!"

The place is well-maintained with clean surroundings and clearly marked pathways, making it easy to navigate. The variety of animals is impressive — from majestic lions and playful monkeys to colorful birds and reptiles. Each enclosure is spacious and designed to resemble the animals’ natural habitat, which shows the effort put into their care and comfort.\n\nThe staff were friendly and informative, always ready to answer questions. Educational boards near each enclosure provided useful details about the species, which made the visit not only fun but also very informative.\n\nFacilities like restrooms, food stalls, and seating areas were clean and accessible. It’s a great spot for families, especially children, as it’s both entertaining and educational.\n\nOverall, the zoo offers a perfect balance of conservation, education, and recreation. I’d definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys spending time with nature and wildlife."

The zoo is quite spacious, with a wide variety of animals, making it a great place to spend an entire day.\n\nA few tips for visitors: carry an empty water bottle – there are many refill stations available, and it's best to avoid single-use plastic bottles. The entry fee is ₹200, which feels a bit on the higher side, so better maintenance and organization would be expected at that price.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience. I enjoyed walking around and managed to capture some good pictures of the animals too."

The distance of the entire park is also so large. But the good thing is there are cycles  available on rent. The cost of the cycle is from Rs.30 to Rs.120 (electric cycles are also available). The entry for Zoo ticket is Rs.200 for adults and Rs.50 for children. Even elephants are also staying long distance. The management should improve a lot."

There's plenty of parking available, though do note that parking is chargeable. You can take a ticket either by scanning the QR code at the entrance or by paying at the cash counter.\n\nBefore entering the zoo, there's a strict check NO PLASTIC items are allowed, which is a great initiative for the environment. You’re allowed to bring food and snacks, but only in steel containers, which is especially helpful if you're visiting with kids or adults who prefer home-packed meals.\n\nInside, you can choose how you want to explore the place. You can rent a cycle (battery or manual) or simply walk around if you have the stamina and want to take your time. One of the highlights is the Jeep Safari for the lion visit it’s an AC vehicle and requires a separate ticket.\n\nAt the end of the visit, there's a children’s play area, along with a snacks shop and food court, making it a nice way to wind down after all the walking and exploring.\n\nOverall, it's a well-maintained and family,friendly place perfect for a fullday outing!"

There’s a lot to see from life-size rocket models like the GSLV and BrahMos to interactive science exhibits. The 360-degree 3D sphere show was definitely a highlight really immersive and well done. I also found the weighing machine that shows your weight on different planets pretty cool.\n\nThe human evolution section with displays on early humans and Neanderthals was interesting and there were plenty of exhibits covering space chemistry and physics. The outdoor area had some dinosaur models though a few could use some maintenance. There were also some defense and technology exhibits adding to the variety. I noticed another 3D show but I didn’t have time to check it out.\n\nOverall it’s a great place for anyone interested in space and science. Definitely worth a visit especially for students and families"

              "reviewText": "Birla Planetarium is located right in the heart of the city. It’s a quiet place with plenty of parking available in front. The ticket prices are very reasonable – **INR 100 for adults and INR 50 for children** covers the entire package (Planetarium show, entry, 3D show, and Sphere show). There’s also an option to buy a **basic INR 35 ticket** for only the Planetarium show.\n\nThe campus is not very large, so walking inside is easy. At the entrance, you’re greeted by an **old fighter jet (HAL HF-24 Marut)**, an **old steam locomotive**, and a **model of the GSLV rocket**. There’s also an **evolution park (Dinosaur World)**, but unfortunately, like the science and industrial play areas for kids, it isn’t well maintained.\n\nThe **real highlight is inside** – the Planetarium and the Science Exhibition Centre. Clean washrooms are available outside, and there are gift, souvenir, and toy shops inside. Food options are limited to a small snack counter selling tea, coffee, and light snacks, so it’s best to carry your own lunch if you plan to spend the full 5–6 hours here. Do note that food and water bottles are not allowed inside the Planetarium show, but they can be deposited at the front desk.\n\n**Science & Exhibition Centre:**\n\n* **Ground Floor:**\n\n* DRDO Gallery (models of tanks, battle equipment, and Tejas aircraft)\n* Hall of Nuclear Power (detailed displays on nuclear power generation)\n* 3D Show (10-minute dinosaur world movie with 3D glasses – very exciting for kids)\n\n* **First Floor:**\n\n* Oceans Gallery\n* Mirror House (fun for kids with mirror illusions)\n* Indian Space Gallery (models, information on ISRO projects, and a live quiz show)\n* Ramanujan Mathematics Gallery (interactive experiments)\n* Heart Museum (hearts of different animals preserved in jars)\n* Science on a Sphere (visual science show on a spherical display)\n\n**Planetarium Show:**\nThe absolute **star attraction** – a 20-minute immersive journey through space, stars, the Sun, Moon, and other planets. Truly fascinating, especially for children.\n\n✨ **Overall:** Birla Planetarium is highly educational and an excellent place for kids interested in science, space, and technology. While the outdoor exhibits and some galleries could use better maintenance, the Planetarium and Science Centre make the visit absolutely worthwhile."

Devotees still seek blessings for health.\n\nSage Valmiki and other saints like Bharadwaja, Markandeya, and even the celestial Kamadhenu cow are all connected to this temple’s lore  .\n\nArchitecture & Deity\n\nThe temple sits on about 1 acre, with two grand seven-tiered gopurams on East Coast Road and West Tank Street  .\n\nInside, a large mandapam with 36 intricately carved pillars houses the serene Somaskanda form of Shiva, alongside shrines for Tripurasundari (Parvati), Murugan, Ganesha, Dakshinamurthy, and others  .\n\nThe self-manifested (swayambhu) Shiva Linga, called Palvannanathar, stands facing west — a rarity among Shiva temples  .\n\nVisitor Experience\n\nThe temple exudes a calm, spiritual energy. Devotees come here seeking healing and peace, often taking ritual dips in its sacred tank  .\n\nIt hosts six daily rituals and twelve annual festivals, including Panguni Brahmotsavam and Maha Shivaratri  .\n\nAfter a recent ₹75 lakh renovation (2020 Kumbhabhishekam), the temple is beautifully maintained and vibrant  .\n\nIn summary, the Marundeeswarar Temple is far more than a historic structure — it feels like a living sanctuary of spiritual healing and timeless devotion. A definitive must-visit on Chennai’s temple trail.\n\nA unique feature of the temple is the sacred tree (Sthala Vriksham) under which Lord Shiva is believed to have given darshan. The space around the tree feels calm and spiritually powerful — a perfect spot to sit peacefully for a few minutes.\n\nThe temple is spacious, well-maintained, and offers a serene experience, especially on weekdays. It's a great place to escape from the hustle of the city while still being in the heart of Chennai.\n\nNote: There are a few stray dogs outside the temple premises. They usually stay around the entrance and can be aggressive at times — it's best to stay cautious and avoid approaching them.\n\nA must-visit for anyone seeking a spiritually enriching experience in Chennai.\n\nParking of vechile is available with a cost of 50"

              "reviewText": "Arulmigu Vadapalani Murugan Temple (Chennai) is devotion with momentum—nadaswaram in the air, steady darshan lines, and the towering gopuram welcoming you from a distance. The sanctum feels powerful and unhurried; priests are courteous and guide first-timers through simple offerings. The campus is clean, prasadam counters run smoothly (pongal/laddu are worth it), and there’s shade to sit for a few quiet minutes even on busy days. It’s also a popular wedding temple, so you may catch a mandapam buzzing with ceremonies.\n\nGood to know: Tuesdays, Fridays, Kanda Sashti, and Thai Poosam draw big crowds—come early morning or late evening. Footwear counters are organized; photography is fine in outer prakarams (not inside the sanctum). Parking is tight around Arcot Road—Vadapalani Metro station is the easiest way in. Dress modestly and carry small change/UPI for archana tickets and prasadam.\n\nTip: If you prefer a quicker darshan, ask at the counter for the special-entry line.\nSecret tip: Arrive just before opening time—the first deeparadhanai (“suprabhatham” vibe) is the calmest, most beautiful moment, with the Vel lit by lamps and hardly any crowd."

Just before the main entrance, I noticed a small chapel stand, open for free to visitors. Inside the temple, there are multiple idols of different gods—it’s not dedicated to just one deity. The sculptures and architecture are truly impressive, reflecting the temple’s rich heritage, as it is said to have been constructed around the 8th century.\n\nI personally prefer old temples, and this one stands out with its intricate carvings and spiritual atmosphere. There is also a temple pond within the premises, which I couldn’t visit this time, but it adds to the traditional charm.\n\nFor anyone interested in experiencing ancient temples with great sculptures and strong cultural significance, this temple is a must-visit. Accessibility is also convenient, as the Vadapalani Metro Station is nearby, making it easy for commuters."

This place offers a wonderful opportunity to visit and impart knowledge of our heritage. They have meticulously recreated various aspects of South Indian cultures and related replicas, while also actively promoting historical arts and handicrafts. I strongly recommend that families, especially those seeking to instill values in their children, consider a day outing here. It's a commendable initiative supported by excellent companies."

Need at half a day to have a meaningful visit.\n\nBags are not allowed inside. Amenities available. Shops sell you stuff, beautiful stuff, but expensive.

It’s a wonderful experience not only for kids but also for builders, architects, or even anyone dreaming of constructing their own home.\n\nSo why only 3 stars? Mainly because of the confusing layout and lack of proper guidance. Some areas are not well maintained—certain buildings and rooms are closed without explanation, while others are being used for storage. Although I was given a pamphlet with a map, it was hardly useful.\n\nFrom the entrance to the exit, there should at least be clear milestones or directional boards. For example: “Start here → Next visit Tamil Nadu House → Exit this way. To visit Kerala House, follow this route,” etc. Without proper instructions, it’s very difficult to fully enjoy and experience the cultural richness and diversity showcased in the museum."

              "reviewText": "I visited Dhakana Chitra Heritage Museum with my family last weekend, and it was one of the most enjoyable and enriching day trips we’ve had in a long time. This place is more than just a museum — it’s a well-planned heritage village that combines cultural learning with a comfortable, family-friendly environment. I’ll share my experience in detail so that it helps anyone planning a visit.\n\n⏰ Timings & Entry\nThe museum is open from morning till evening (usually around 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM), and I recommend arriving as early as possible. We reached around 10:30 AM, which was perfect because the place was less crowded, the weather was cooler, and we could take our time exploring without rushing. The ticket counter staff were friendly and explained the map of the place so we could plan our route. They also mentioned the timings for any live demonstrations happening that day.\n\n🧹 Cleanliness & Maintenance\nOne of the first things I noticed was how incredibly clean and well-maintained the entire place is. The pathways are swept, there’s no litter anywhere, and the gardens are beautifully trimmed. Even the restrooms — something I’m always cautious about when visiting public places — were spotless, with running water, soap, and hand-drying facilities. The traditional houses and displays are also well-kept, with no dust or neglect, which really adds to the pleasant experience.\n\n🍴 Food & Refreshments\nThere’s a small but well-run food court area inside the museum grounds. The menu is simple, offering local South Indian snacks like dosa, idli, vada, and upma, along with fresh juices, coffee, and tea. Prices are reasonable, and the food tastes fresh and homely. We had a late breakfast of masala dosa and filter coffee, and it was delicious. For lunch, there’s a traditional thali option that gives you an authentic taste of local cuisine. There are also cold drinks, bottled water, and ice creams available, which is great if you’re visiting with kids. The seating area is shaded, clean, and surrounded by greenery, so it’s relaxing to take a break here.\n\nArrive early to avoid the afternoon heat and crowds.\n\nWear comfortable shoes because there’s a lot of walking.\n\nKeep a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen handy.\n\nCarry some cash if you want to buy directly from artisans (though the main food court accepts digital payments).\n\nPlan to spend at least 3 hours here — more if you have kids who want to explore every corner.\n\n🏛 Museum Layout & Attractions\nThe museum is designed like a small village, with different sections showcasing heritage from various parts of India. Each house or structure you enter has information boards in English and regional languages, explaining its history and purpose. This makes it easy for both adults and older children to understand and appreciate what they’re seeing\n\n🎭 Cultural Performances & Seasonal Events\nDepending on when you visit, there may be live folk dance or music performances. We were lucky to catch a small folk dance performance in the afternoon, and it really added to the atmosphere. During festival seasons, the museum often has special events, craft fairs, and workshops for kids, so it’s worth checking their calendar before you go.\n\n🌳 Atmosphere & Comfort\nThe entire place has a very peaceful, relaxing atmosphere. Even though there’s a lot to see, it doesn’t feel rushed or crowded. The shaded walkways, occasional benches, and water refill stations make it easy to take breaks. There are plenty of trees and open spaces, so it’s never stuffy.\n\nIf you’re into photography, the museum is a paradise — every corner is photogenic, from the colorful doors to the hand-painted walls and traditional artefacts\n\n🛍 Shopping for Souvenirs\nNear the exit, there’s a gift shop selling authentic handicrafts, postcards, and handmade toys. Prices are fair, and the quality is much better than what you’d find in typical tourist markets. We picked up a couple of hand-painted wooden keychains and a small terracotta pot — perfect as reminders of our visit"

One of the highlights of my visit was the 4D VR show, which took us through Swami Vivekananda's powerful and spiritual journey in a truly immersive way.\n\nThe visuals, sound, and storytelling were amazing—it felt like I was walking alongside him through different phases of his life, especially his journey to the West and his speech at the Parliament of Religions in Chicago. It gave me a deeper understanding of his vision, thoughts, and contribution to Indian philosophy.\n\nOverall, it's a must-visit place for anyone interested in history, spirituality, or just looking for inspiration. I left the place feeling motivated and proud of our rich cultural heritage."

There are are couple of theatres inside the museum where his Chicago speech, his early life are been portrayed. It will take some time in order to visit the museum. There is also a mediation hall where you can sit and meditate which is described as the place where he used to meditate when he came to Chennai.\n\nThey do have a bookstore where they sell his books. The ticket charges ₹50 per head. They will also take a photo free of cost and can be downloaded from the link they provide."

I’ve been seeing this place from outside for more than 25 years, since my childhood, as it is close to my grandfather’s house. Whenever I go across Marina, this pink building always stands out and reminds me of its cultural and historical significance.\n\nThough many people visit inside for school trips, exhibitions, or spiritual visits to learn about Swami Vivekananda and experience peace, the outside itself has a charm. Recently, opposite Vivekananda House, they have started putting up a big screen for open-air Tamil movie screenings, where the crowd sits together to watch evergreen films. The atmosphere becomes lively, with nearby stalls selling hot crispy bhajjis, ice creams, seafood like fish and prawn, fried rice, sodas, and popcorn – giving a true Chennai beachside vibe.\n\nThis place beautifully balances heritage and modern leisure – inside for culture and spirituality, and outside for entertainment and food. Truly, Vivekananda House is not just a building but a symbol of Marina itself."

I went this Sunday first of all I parked my car outside of the parking zone still the parking person forcefully took parking charges. On entering I paid 25/- ticket but inside nothing I saw just a simple small lake and few trees.  Very small and half of the portion of the park is closed and not accessible from the public. It’s only for daily walkers. The security guards were weird and was giving weird look making me uncomfortable. On asking anything they were very rude. Overall below average experience."

I was surprised to see such a natural beauty in the middle of the busy city. There was an entrance ticket 24 rs for adults and 10 rs for kids and parking ticket based on the number of hours.\n\nWe walked around the beautiful lake during the sunset, the air there was so fresh. There were snacks joint in between near to kids play area where there were snacks and icecream available.\n\nThere is a separate walking trail available only for members who walk on a regular basis and not open for others.\n\nWe had a very peaceful walk and there was boating also available but as it was dark we did not try it. After the walk we ended up at a place where the carnival was happening and there was a host conducting games for families.. There was some paid games available at that place for kids . It was good to see families enjoying their time and adults playing some games..\n\nOverall we had a very good time in the  Really appreciate the government for making that lake as a beautiful Eco park where people can go and en6the beautiful nature."

Area of this place is not huge to cover it as like queensland. All rides are enjoyable with friends and family. Canteen is available here, no outside foods are allowed here. Prices of food is ok. Quality and quantity also ok. Few rides are really mind blowing and thrilling experience. Water games are always best in MGM. So start early and enjoy all the games till the evening. Auto or cab from here to return home may be very costly. So plan it accordingly."

If you have been to Wonderla, this is ten times a downgrade for the high price of a ticket. In terms of dry rides, Queensland is better and cheaper. And don't even ask me about water rides; only one was functional when I went. You can definitely have fun if you go as a gang, but I would personally save up some money and time and visit Wonderla for a fulfilling adventure park fun time with friends."

I’ve been visiting it regularly – both early in the mornings and late at night, and each visit has something special to offer.\n\n🌅 Sunrise at the beach is a serene and beautiful experience. The soft golden light, the gentle sound of waves, and the cool breeze instantly lift your mood. It’s the perfect time to go for a peaceful walk or just sit by the shore and soak in the calmness before the city wakes up.\n\n🌇 Sunset, on the other hand, brings its own charm. The sky turns into a canvas of oranges and pinks, and the atmosphere becomes livelier with people strolling, kids playing, and street food vendors lighting up the beachside. There’s something so refreshing and calming about the place, no matter what time of day it is. The moment you step onto the sand, you feel a sense of peace and lightness that only the sea can bring.\n\n🎉 One of the exciting things about Bessie is that they screen IPL matches on big screens during the season! It adds a vibrant community vibe, with people cheering, relaxing with friends and family, and enjoying snacks while watching the game in the open air with the sea breeze around.\n\nWhether you’re looking for quiet reflection during sunrise, chilling with friends in the evening, or even just grabbing a bite from the food stalls, Besant Nagar Beach never disappoints. It’s clean, lively, and safe, and has become a sort of personal escape zone for me within the city.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone visiting Chennai or even locals who haven’t made this part of their regular routine yet!"

Whether you visit at dawn, when the sky blushes softly, or in the evening under the moonlit glow, the place feels magical. The waves are lively but soothing, and the breeze carries that unmistakable salty freshness.\n\nThere’s a lively stretch near the shore with small stalls, local snacks, and the hum of people enjoying themselves, yet you can always find quieter corners to just sit and watch the ocean. The beach is perfect for long walks, photography, or simply letting time slow down while the waves kiss your feet.\n\nIf you’re in Chennai, Basant Nagar Beach isn’t just a spot—it’s an experience. 🌊✨"

Our family felt extremely joyful and grateful for the arrangements by Rina’s team, bringing life to the magical dream wedding.\n\nA perfect spot for a traditional Hindu Brahmin wedding.\nWe laid the dots of our expectations and saw an incredible kolam( rangoli) transformation on the day. It was heavenly.\nWe said what colours, patterns  and themes for decorations and garlands. We were all  really impressed by the ambience. A feast for our eyes✨⭐️\nDay 1 Vradham, janavasam, Nithchayadartham and Reception. We didnt feel any stress as it was organised so well by Rina’s team including DJ/ sound system.\n\nThe ISKON temple next door, the beautifully decorated Red Rolls Royce for Janavasam, the electrifying drummer all along bringing out best dance movements and joyful.\nThe patio, the lilly pond was the highlight to imbibe spiritual experience. The decorative open air reception was stunning.\nDay 2 Kasi Yayharai, Oonjal , muhoortham and Nalangu was exceptional.\nRina’s Team helped with the display stalls filled with dolls representing cultural values, the Oonjal decorations from a huge tree outside the mutham was amazing and authentic. The floor pathway decorations was fantastic. We were spell bound.\n\nNevertheless there will be few surprising guests of flies as the venue is surrounded by nature, scented flowers, trees which seems inevitable! We felt blessed by new visitors.\n\nOn the whole i would recommend Rina’s venue for a personalised magical wedding celebration if you are looking for a heavenly traditional authentic memorable celebration 💖\nI thank Rina Nadam, Natchi and all their team members who work tirelessly with perfection bringing unforgettable beautiful memories in your life journey.\n\nKeep going Rina and Team 🙏👍👌"

The food is okay, though the kitchen probably needs some better pest control.  Ola and Ubers are a bit hard to book from the venue so you should get your own transport somehow."

Vijay the property manager has exceptional eye for detailing and helps you plan your big day in the most efficient manner. Nachi Anna - the art director for the venue is par excellence. He designed our wedding at par with Jodha Akbar movie set and a lot more. He was awake and there the entire night to make sure things fall in place. Amidst all this not to forget, they help you plan your budget and are transparent with regards to the entire costing and there are no hidden costs.\n\nThe venue in itself is beautiful, it gives you a trendy yet cozy feeling unlike other lawn venues, the place feels at home. It's traditional yet modern. It has all the amenities and is a heaven for photographers. There are multiple areas and spots on the property for various events and occasions. Each of the spot has it's own high points you can plan mehandi, haldi, Sangeet, reception and wedding at different spots within the same venue.\n\nThe arcade inside is beautiful and magnificent, we decided to turn it into a stage with rose petals pool around it - this was a visual treat. Our guests went Gaga over the Decoration and the aesthetics of the venue. Not to forget, we were outstation and collaborating over video calls, the management was very accommodating.\n\nAll in all, we had a dream wedding just the way we wanted. A huge shoutout to all the staff from Rina's Venue and a special thanks to Vijay and Nachi Anna - you guys have our heart ❤️ #bash !!"

The decor was absolutely splendid and breath taking. It felt like a fairytale wedding. Throughly enjoyed my special day.

A lot of our guests have taken pictures around the venue with the decoration and put the pictures in Facebook. That made us happy because we know the guests had a great time and enjoyed the evening.\n\nWe had our daughter’s wedding in the courtyard with traditional home background and decorations. All our guests could see the wedding in close quarters and felt like being in their home function.\n\nThe reception decoration filled with lights were fantastic and beautiful. Really brought the evening alive. Mr Nachiappan is exceptional in his work.Thank you.\n\nThanks to Mrs Rina and Vijay who have made all the arrangements and also provided us with the necessary contacts that are needed for a wedding.\n\nA couple of little things we were expecting were that the lights put up in the lawn were not exactly what we wanted and the drapes on the entrance were not changed the following morning. It was supposed to be yellow and gold but it was purple and peach (what we had for reception). Also, we were a little disappointed that the some of the decorations were taken down before we could do some couple shoots, especially around the swing area. As the muhurth time was after 10am, wedding went on until lunch time. Had we known that the decorations would be brought down immediately after the wedding, we would have planned the shoot before they were taken off. May be some communication gap.\n\nNevertheless, the event was a grand success and soul satisfying with great vibes as if it was done in our own family home. All our guests who attended in person as well through streaming, appreciated the venue as well arrangements and mentioned that it is totally different from a wedding in a conventional wedding mandapams. Thanks again to Mrs Rina and her excellent team."

There are rocks on either sides of the piers and one cannot leave without taking some pictures here. The pier closes sharply at 6PM and police escorts everyone out by then. There is a beach beside the pier and is very neat. It is well connected by buses and the nearest metro station is New Washermenpet, which is around 400 metres from the beach.  Overall, truly a hidden gem in Northern Chennai and is a must visit. A perfect place to hangout with friends."

Unlike the crowded Marina Beach, this bridge provides solitude and stunning views of the sun sinking into the horizon. Situated at the mouth of the Adyar River near Theosophical Society forest, it is a popular spot for poetry lovers and amateur photographers. Despite its collapsed state since 1977, it remains an offbeat attraction that attracts couples seeking a unique and picturesque setting for a romantic rendezvous.",

Also we can't climb over the bridge if we try that..there is surveillance camera by police. It starts to create warning sound if we go nearby to bridge/ try to climb on it or play in water. Camera is really working because when some school boys climb over bridge camera starts to create beep sound over long time and then police came and warned those school boys. This is same for both weekdays and weekends. Rather than this thing...this place is really nice to visit. It's free to visit this place. 10/08/2025."

We asked for preponement (actual timing was 11 AM to 2 PM) and it was  agreed upon by the owner. We completed the shoot according to the stipulated time and we were in the process of packing and  moving out. Meanwhile, the young couple out of curiosity and interest it seems that they took additional photos which was objected  by the female employee (we agree to her objection) who was coordinating the bookings on behalf of the owner. As reported by my son her body language and words / sentences used was very very harsh and ferocious. She behaved in the same manner with me also. She should  give respect to elders at-least. Other persons (Watchman, owner's driver and the person who was selling buttermilk) who witnessed her rude behaviour even outside the Secret Garden premises had said that was her usual  behaviour. While dealing with the public especially with the youngsters who are bound to be curious during the happy moments of photo shoot, she can  be polite to some extent. No doubt that the owner with whom we were in communication over mobile phone was very decent, polite  and cooperative.  Sir, as the owner, you have the full rights to speak anything to the client.  Sir, please ask her to report any such incidents to you and you can decide as to whether to return the caution deposit to the client or deduct it for extended shoot. Sir, i know that after having read this review you will say this is a false review. But, truth always prevails. Sir, we understand that you are dealing with a business wherein different types of visitors will be there and it's difficult for you to handle them. Finally, my only request to you is that the female employee who does possess a good managerial and administrative skills may be asked to be little polite and not be very ferocious please.......Regards."

You can also access the beach which is about 200 metres walk from the location\n\nWord of advice: take a photographer who knows the place so that they can select the exact location which matches your costumes which will save a lot of time.\n\nThe property can avail better refreshments for the guests that would be better but overall a very good place"

The pricing is also somewhat higher than other studios.

They need to adjust their behavior.  I would not recommend this studio to couples."

Here's what stood out:\n\nHistory & Architecture\n\nOne of Chennai’s oldest surviving temples, originally built by the Pallavas in the 6th–8th century, then expanded by the Cholas and later Vijayanagara kings  .\n\nA proud Divya Desam, praised in the Naalayira Divya Prabandham by the Alvars  .\n\nFeatures classic Dravidian structure: towering Raja Gopuram, ornate stone pillars, 36-pillared mandapam, and detailed carvings  .\n\nMultiple Forms of Perumal\n\nCentral shrine houses Lord Parthasarathy (Krishna–Charioteer of Arjuna), unique with a moustache (“Meesai Perumal”) and holding only a conch (no discus), believed to bear Bheeshma’s arrow scars from Kurukshetra  .\n\nOther shrines honor Yoga Narasimha, Rama, Gajendra Varadaraja, and Ranganatha, making it a revered Panchamurthi sthalam  .\n\nMeesai Perumal & Variants\n\nThe moustached form is an iconic visual; during certain days of Vaikunta Ekadasi, he's shown without a moustache, symbolizing humility  .\n\nThe temple also includes a distinct shrine for Yoga Narasimha, with its own entrance and dhvajastambha  .\nPrasadam\n\nThe Ven Pongal served here is particularly sweet and rich, made with extra ghee and cashews—believed to soothe the deity's arrow wounds  .\n\nCommon temple prasadam like Puliyodarai is also loved by devotees  .\n\nLocation & Atmosphere\n\nSituated in the heart of Triplicane, just a few minutes from Marina Beach, yet it feels like a peaceful oasis  .\n\nReal devotees comment on its positive aura, dedicated priests, and well-maintained grounds  .\n\nFestivals & Events\n\nMajor celebrations include Chittirai Brahmotsavam, Vaikunta Ekadasi, and the Masi (February–March) Theppam (float festival) in the temple tank  .\n\nThe annual Ramanujar festival is significant—legend says his father performed a Putrakameshti yagna here and received the blessing that Ramanuja would be born  .\n\nSummary\n\nA divine blend of ancient architecture, living tradition, and deep Vaishnava devotion—this temple is high on my list for anyone seeking spiritual depth or historical richness in Chennai. The sight of Meesai Perumal, the serene tank, and the lusciously sweet prasadam make it unforgettable."

              "reviewText": "The Parthasarathy Temple, nestled in the vibrant Triplicane area of Chennai, is an absolute must-visit for anyone seeking a blend of spiritual tranquility, historical richness, and architectural of the oldest temples in Chennai, dedicated to Lord Krishna (as Parthasarathy, the charioteer of Arjuna), it offers a truly immersive experience.\n\nFrom the moment you step through its towering gopuram, you are enveloped in an atmosphere of devotion. The intricate carvings on the pillars and walls tell tales from Hindu mythology, showcasing the exquisite craftsmanship of the Pallava and later Chola and Vijayanagara periods. The vibrant colors of the deities and the constant chanting of hymns create a serene and uplifting ambiance.\n\nWhat truly sets this temple apart is its unique dedication to five forms of Vishnu: Krishna (Parthasarathy), Rama, Ranganatha, Gajendra Varadaraja, and Narasimha. Each shrine is beautifully maintained, allowing devotees to offer prayers and admire the distinct iconography. The main deity, Lord Parthasarathy, with his iconic mustache and scars from the Mahabharata war, is particularly captivating.\n\nThe temple complex is surprisingly spacious and well-organized, making it easy to navigate. Don't miss the opportunity to witness the daily rituals and aarti, which are performed with great devotion and precision. The spiritual energy during these times is palpable.\n\nBeyond its religious significance, the Parthasarathy Temple is a living testament to South Indian heritage. It's a place where history breathes, art flourishes, and faith resonates deeply. Must visit temple in chennai."

Upon entering, you’re greeted by a striking marble statue of Lord Cornwallis—an iconic landmark and conversation starter.\n\nGround floor features armaments and porcelain; an upper floor displays portraits, medals, and coins; and the top floor houses the Indian national flag hoisted after Independence.\n\nWell-preserved galleries, especially the detailed craftsmanship on artifacts and colonial ephemera.\n\nThe museum can feel quite warm, especially on hot days. Fans are few and spaced out.\n\nEntry ticket can be booked through online link, via QR codes only, at the entrance.\n\nSince the museum lies within a government compound, anticipate police screening. Carry a valid ID. Open from 9 AM to 5 PM. Entry Fee: Rs.20 per head. Bring water, there are limited facilities inside. St Mary’s Church (“Westminster Abbey of the East”) is worth exploring too.\n\nNice place to spend 1 to 2 hours with family. Children might enjoy the artifact's.\n\nFree Car parking available across the main road."

The Chennai Rail Museum has some really old trains and engines on display. I loved walking around and seeing all the vintage stuff, some of them are huge and really old, like from the British times. During my visit, many school students from different schools had come and they were really enjoying it a lot and super excited during the toy train ride. Even I enjoyed it. They also have a restaurant set up inside a train coach, but it was not open during my visit. Overall, it’s a calm and neat place to visit. If you're in Chennai and want to try something offbeat, this place is worth checking out."

It could be a comforting nook for you amidst a hustle and bustle of the city life. Tea was way better than coffee. Coffee beans they are using are a wee bit on an acid and stronger side with no delicate notes of nuts or chocolate. I recommend main courses and some side menus."

Ground floor has women's boutique and first floor has a men's wear section, women's jewellery and cafe. The cafe itself has two partitions. One with beautiful chairs and meant for a date brunch or casual meetings. The second section is more cozy with books lined on shelves and cushioned chairs and sofas. Pick any book you like, read for how ever long you want. Their selection of breakfasts and coffees are definitely worth more visits. Hosts and servers are friendly and helpful with any queries about the menu. The waiting time is fairy short in the mornings but lunch rush will have you waiting for at least twenty minutes. But it's worth all the waiting.\nDefinitely hungry to try more dishes!"

I have a very mixed opinion in food, yes it is overpriced and veg pizza was way too cheesy, sea food pizza was too bland. Only the arabiata pastas were enjoyable but also with extra tanginess. Dessert varieties are as same as wild garden cafe and the taste was 👌🏻. Luxury with a very very average dining and unresponsive service; Keeping the restrooms and washrooms downstairs did not feel very hospitable. Couldn't recommend for a good meal."

The soft lighting and comfortable seating made it an ideal spot for both casual meetups and intimate gatherings.\n\nI started with their mushroom ravioli pasta which was absolutely divine! The handmade pasta was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of bite, while the mushroom filling was rich and earthy. The cream sauce was delicately seasoned, allowing the natural flavors of the mushrooms to shine through. Each bite was a beautiful balance of textures and flavors.\n\nThe Korean cheese bun was a delightful surprise! Warm and fluffy with a crisp exterior, the cheese filling was wonderfully stretchy and flavorful with just a hint of sweetness that complemented the savory elements perfectly. It's clearly a house specialty for good reason.\n\nFor dessert, I couldn't resist trying their blueberry pastry and jam cookies. The pastry was buttery and flaky, generously filled with fresh blueberries that burst with natural sweetness. The jam cookies were equally impressive – buttery shortbread with a dollop of homemade jam that added just the right amount of fruity tang.\n\nThe staff were attentive without being intrusive, offering helpful recommendations and ensuring our experience was memorable. The prices were reasonable considering the quality and portion sizes.\n\nI'm already planning my next visit to try more items from their menu! Fika is definitely a hidden gem worth discovering for anyone looking for a cozy café with outstanding food and welcoming atmosphere."

The dish had 5 strips and more fries it was priced at 425 INR. Rose milk 190. Later, we ordered white sauced pasta , red sauced pasta , garden paneer pizza , chickpeas and walnut cutlet each dishes were ranging from 375 to 475 INR , at last we ordered one cold coffee and coconut milk with coffee it was ranging around 275. The food taste was good, the way it was presented was appetising, I personally felt the chicken strips could have better quantity for the pricing and even the chickpeas walnut cutlet was very blunt in taste. Rose milk 190 is too much it’s way more pricey for it. They can scope down prices for certain dishes.\n\nService: Service approach is fine but we had to wait for so long to get the orders placed. We could not much waiters visiting us and to check on us. It could have been better if you could improve your terms in service by greeting the customers and to check whether everything was okay. For the pricing and so called experience I strongly suggest this has to be improved. One of the waiter gave us suggestion when I asked something that’s kids friendly starter I appreciate that. What ever we asked they delivered but the time was lagging\nLocation. It’s a great space utilised lively location in a prime place. Very peaceful. But cleanliness level has to be improved. The eaten plates cups are left for longer period I noticed. The curtains were dirty. Kindly take extra care of your things so we also enjoy everything altogether :)\n\nExcept certain improvements required we enjoyed being there."

              "reviewText": "Fika is good but not great!. Yeah you heard me correct. Okay let me break this down for you. Let's start with the ambience. Yes the ambience is actually quite good. They do we have a really cool place with both indoor and outdoor sitting and the place itself is actually spacious enough. They have a really nice ambient lighting and overall the place throws out a positive peaceful vibe. Now let's come to the elephant in the room, the actual food. This one I would say is average. They do have really good food options but if you are a vegetarian then sad news for you there aren't much of options you can choose. We went for Veg Aglio e Olio pasta, Veg cheesy tart and toffee pudding. Pasta was average and the tart was really heavy with a excessive content of butter which was overwhelming. The passing was also kind of average. So in the food department I would say it was really average. Now coming to the price this is also not that good since the prices are on heavier side compared to similar restaurants. So overall it is hard to suggest fika if you are looking for a budget friendly delicious outing.🥲"

Adding to it, the food was also really good.\n\nTheir must try is the Vanilla Panna cotta, it was super delicious. We tried their Fish Fingers but it wasn't up to the mark.\n\nEverything was good but I had to reduce one star due to the price of the dishes. The prices were too high. The dishes aren't satisfying enough for the price they charge.\n\nAlso, optional service charge is included in the final bill amount. If you don't wish to pay, you can less that amount and pay the remaining. I didn't like this concept as the service charge was more of like a hidden charge. We noticed it only after paying the bill."

Countless vendors line the wide lanes, displaying a vibrant variety of fresh vegetables, fruits, and flowers sourced from various farms in Tamil Nadu and other distant states.\n\nThe air is filled with a symphony of voices, buyers negotiating in Tamil, lorry drivers unloading produce, and traders organizing their goods for onward sale. Despite its busy atmosphere, the market is fairly organized, divided into dedicated blocks that simplify navigation for seasoned buyers and newcomers alike.\n\nThe infrastructure of Koyambedu Market is impressive, with spacious sheds, large storage facilities, and ample parking areas that accommodate heavy-duty vehicles and commercial vans. Hygiene standards have improved over the years, cleaning crews ensure walkways remain passable despite the high foot traffic.\n\nOne of the market’s highlights is its diverse offering. Traders find almost every agricultural commodity imaginable, from common staples like tomatoes, onions, bananas, and coconuts to more exotic produce and regional specialties.\n\nFlower stalls are particularly striking, covering a wide spectrum of colors. Prices remain competitive due to direct-from-farm supply chains, making it a haven for businesses seeking bulk purchases as well as local residents looking for fresh produce at reasonable rates.\n\nSecurity and safety are visibly prioritized, with surveillance cameras and a vigilant market committee overseeing operations. Early mornings see the market at its liveliest, with peak trading activity, but the pace continues well into the afternoon.\n\nThe area surrounding the market hosts a variety of tea stalls, snack shops, and small eateries, offering much-needed respite for traders and shoppers alike.\n\nKoyambedu Market is well connected by the Chennai Metro, local buses, and arterial highways. Accessibility has made it a vital hub not just for Chennai, but for the entire region’s food distribution network.\n\nOverall, Koyambedu Market is more than just a wholesale market. It reflects the dynamic commercial pulse of Chennai, marrying tradition with modernity in both its scale and operations. It’s a must-visit for anyone seeking to experience the heart of Tamil Nadu’s trade culture and the lively spirit of its people."

If you go in the morning hours, you’ll find vegetables and fruits at much cheaper, wholesale prices, with multiple varieties to choose from. From daily veggies to seasonal fruits, even dry fruits, chocolates, and other grocery items – almost everything is available under one roof.\n\nThis is also the place where local vendors buy in bulk during the early morning, and later sell the same items at higher prices in local areas. So, if you want the freshest produce at the best price, morning is the best time to visit.\n\nThe market is definitely crowded, but surprisingly well-managed and kept fairly clean for the number of people it serves. Paid parking is available at a nominal ₹10 fee, which makes it convenient if you’re driving.\n\nOverall, Koyambedu Market is not just a shopping spot, it feels like the heartbeat of Chennai’s vegetable supply chain. If you’re someone who loves variety, freshness, and wholesale rates – this is the place you shouldn’t miss. 🥦🍎✨"

Not maintained well and garbage all around. One staff was desperately trying to do her best in getting things ready for us. No place to keep your bags etc. Indoor sports room is a dust bowl with their staff working out of there & all sports equipment are either broken or missing ( chess/carrom). All table tennis balls were broken and they did not have a single good one. No proper seating or lighting in that room. Snooker board was also very dirty. Beach access was decent but it is a common beach, not a private one. You may see a crowd from outside smoking there. It was such a bad experience that we did not even wait for lunch . One look at the plates and the smell from kitchen, we packed our bags and left. Surely will not recommend this place."

              "reviewText": "The MA Chidambaram Stadium, fondly known as Chepauk Stadium, is one of the most iconic and historic cricket venues in India. Located in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, it holds a special place in the hearts of cricket fans due to its deep-rooted legacy and passionate crowd.\n\nStepping into Chepauk feels like walking into a temple of cricket. The energy is electric, especially during IPL matches when the yellow sea of Chennai Super Kings fans brings the stadium to life. The roar from the stands when MS Dhoni steps onto the field is truly spine-tingling and something every cricket enthusiast should experience at least once.\n\nThe view from the stands is excellent, with well-maintained seating and a layout that gives most spectators a clear view of the action. The upgraded infrastructure and new pavilions have improved the overall comfort and experience. Facilities like clean restrooms, food courts, and accessible entry points make it convenient for families and fans of all ages.\n\nWhat sets Chepauk apart is the knowledgeable crowd. Fans here appreciate the game beyond just boundaries and sixes — even a well-bowled dot ball or a defensive stroke can earn applause. This respect for the sport creates a unique and respectful atmosphere that resonates with players and fans alike.\n\nThe stadium is also easily accessible by public transport and offers a great location close to Marina Beach, making the visit even more enjoyable.\n\nIn short, Chepauk Stadium is not just a place to watch cricket — it's a place to feel cricket. For any die-hard fan, witnessing a match here is nothing short of a dream. The legacy, passion, and pure love for the game make it one of the best stadiums in the country."

The atmosphere is absolutely unbeatable — the sea of yellow, the deafening cheers for Dhoni, and the pure cricket fever make it a one-of-a-kind experience for any fan.\n\nThe stadium itself has a historic vibe and decent facilities. Seating was comfortable enough, though certain stands can get quite hot during day matches. The crowd energy is what makes the place come alive — every boundary and wicket is celebrated like a festival.\n\nEntry and exit were managed decently, though it gets a bit chaotic with the crowd. Snacks and refreshments are available, but a bit pricey and the queues can be long.\n\nOverall, if you're a CSK fan or just love live cricket, this stadium should definitely be on your bucket list. Watching a match here is not just about the game — it’s about being part of the yellow army!"

Water bottles, pens or notepads for even autographs are not allowed (by the way its hard to even see the players from closer quarters). water is available at free of cost inside stadium but its not easily accessible from the stands. Only Coke was available & nothing else on soft drinks and other eatables are costly & quality is not upto the mark. Tshirts & caps are sold near the entry & in station at cheaper rates. Inside stadium after entry flags, whistle & 4s 6s pamplets are given at free of cost. Night view from the stand is way better than afternoon, hardly we were able to see the players face clearly from the distance, may be from a different stand it might be little better. Overall the ambience, crowd chanting & DJ is good but it hardly comes close to the comfort of watching actions closely in a TV with replays. Over hyped costly experience."

Don’t repeat the mistake we made.\n\nIf I were the owner I would fire all the staff and replace with folks who know at least the basics of how to deal with a customer.\n\nNancy especially was just rude and was focused on making money. The watchman is perennially drunk! Horrible staff who just care about money. Good luck getting your deposit amount back.\n\nIt could be a decent venue on a sunny day. It rained heavily during our event and the entire place was a huge mess. They asked us to pay for a temp roof and that was just so broken! The chairs underneath were all wet and we couldn’t use the outdoor space at all.\nThey don’t allow any outside furniture and charge a ton for the dingy old stuff they provide.\nThe washroom is super UNCLEAN and is on a different island. No washroom or restroom on floor 1 and this is a huge inconvenience!\n\nPlease do yourself a favor and do not book this place for any event. Chennai has many solid venues, this is NOT one of those.\n\nResponse to the point from owner below - if your furniture is an antique piece, then add a sign that no one should use it. This is COMMON sense! Rs. 3000 is not a big deal for us either. Your attitude towards customers is just plain wrong! And your response below reflects the same."

              "reviewText": "The Ripon Building, an architectural marvel in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, stands as the headquarters of the Greater Chennai Corporation. This iconic white structure, located near the Chennai Central Railway Station, exemplifies neoclassical architecture, blending Ionic and Corinthian styles. It is a significant remnant of British-era construction and a testament to the city's colonial history.\n\nThe foundation stone of the Ripon Building was laid in 1909 by the Earl of Minto, then Viceroy and Governor-General of India. Designed by G.S.T. Harris and constructed by Loganatha Mudaliar, the building took four years to complete and was officially commissioned in 1913. It was named after Lord Ripon, the Governor-General of British India, who was known as the father of local self-government.\n\nThe building is rectangular in shape, measuring 85 meters in length and 32 meters in width, with a central clock tower rising to a height of 43 meters. The Westminster Quarter chiming clock, installed by Oakes and Co. in 1913, features a mechanical key system and four bells cast by Gillet and Johnston. The structure comprises three floors, with the first floor covering approximately 2,800 square meters. Its walls were built with stock bricks and lime mortar plaster, while the original ground-floor flooring of Cuddapah Slate was later replaced with marble. The roof is supported by teak wood joists, enhancing its durability and aesthetic appeal.\n\nOver time, the Ripon Building has undergone renovations to preserve its grandeur. In September 2015, an annexe building named \"Amma Maaligai\" was inaugurated behind the main structure. This addition houses various departments of the Chennai Corporation, while the offices of the Mayor and Commissioner continue to operate from the original building. The annexe was constructed with modern sustainability features, including a water-cooled air-conditioning system and heat-reflective roof tiles to reduce energy consumption.\n\nThe surrounding area has evolved over the years, with developments such as the Chennai Metro and the modernization of the Central Railway Station complex enhancing the locality's overall appearance. The Ripon Building remains an administrative hub and a symbol of Chennai’s rich heritage, attracting history and architecture enthusiasts. Though primarily a working office, access to its interiors is generally restricted to official business or special heritage tours.\n\nIn front of the building, a well-maintained lawn features statues of Lord Ripon and Sir Thiyagaraya Chetty, further emphasizing its historical significance. The building’s elegant appearance, intricate detailing, and colonial charm continue to make it a notable landmark in Chennai, representing both its past and its enduring legacy in urban governance."
