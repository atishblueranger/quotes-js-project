This was possible only because of right guidance and knowledge sharing from the tutor (Mr. Raj). Each and every class made me improve. The process of getting me familiar with the language was smooth and good. Initially I started learning French just on my own interest and there were no after plans. They also guide us and give ideas of what we can do productive after learning the language which is just great of them. I can say I made a good choice in selecting La Liberté to learn French.",

            "text": "The Cathedral of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, commonly known as Samba Kovil or simply the Immaculate Conception Cathedral, is a historic Roman Catholic church in Puducherry, Tamil Nadu. Located on Mission Street in the heart of the White Town area, near Bharathi Park and about 1 km from the Puducherry Beach promenade, it's a key landmark reflecting the region's French colonial past. Built by Jesuit missionaries, its origins trace back to 1692, though the current structure was completed in 1791 after multiple reconstructions due to destruction by Dutch forces in 1693 and British occupation in 1761. It serves as the mother church of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Pondicherry and Cuddalore, established in 1770.\nThe cathedral showcases Portuguese architectural influences with a white-and-yellow façade, arched windows, and a prominent bell tower topped with a cross. Inside, it features a high-vaulted ceiling, ornate altars, and statues of saints, including a revered statue of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception brought from France. The design blends European elegance with local adaptations, evident in its simple yet striking layout. A notable feature is the annual feast on December 8, marked by a car procession and vibrant celebrations, drawing devotees from across South India.\nOpen daily from 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 3:00 PM to 8:30 PM, Mass timings are 6:15 AM (Tamil) and 5:30 PM (Tamil) on weekdays, with additional Sunday services at 7:00 AM (English) and 5:30 PM (Tamil). Entry is free, though donations are appreciated. The cathedral's location makes it easily accessible-500 meters from the Puducherry Bus Stand, 2 km from the railway station, and 150 km from Chennai International Airport (3-4 hours by road). Winter (October-March) is the best time to visit for comfortable weather.\nA stone's throw from Puducherry's French Quarter, this cathedral offers a serene contrast to the bustling Sacred Heart Basilica (2.5 km away). It's a must-visit for its historical depth, architectural charm, and spiritual significance in South India's Catholic heritage.",

The space was pleasant and cozy, with a beautiful view.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Gratitude is its peaceful, laid-back atmosphere-it's the perfect place to relax. I highly recommend making breakfast a priority during your stay. Shanti, the chef, pours her heart into preparing delicious meals, including some really great food and fresh juice.\n\nIf you're looking for a calm, peaceful, and safe travel experience, Gratitude is an excellent choice. The place is not only hygienic and secure but also easily accessible. You're close to the ocean, the ashram, churches, museums, restaurants, and plenty of options for exploring!",

            "text": "Raj Niwas (translation: Government House) is the official residence of the Lieutenant Governor of Puducherry. It is located in Puducherry's capital city of Pondicherry. Once it was the official residence of the French Governors.\n\nLe Palais Du governor now called the Raj Niwas is situated surrounded by the Rue Jawaharlal Nehru on the North, Rue De Rangapoule on the South and Rue Saint Louis on the East and Rue Francois Martin on the West with access from the north and south. The Governor's House has a history of its own. Pierre Benoît Dumas, the French Governor for Pondicherry, laid the foundation for a Governor's palace in 1738 but the palace had to wait for the arrival of Joseph François Dupleix to see its completion. When Jean Law de Lauriston took over Pondicherry in 1765 the town was completely in ruins. Within a short span of three years a whole new town sprang up on the ruins of the old - the Governor's Palace and the administration offices on the north, the warehouses on the south, the military barracks on the east and west.",
