Carved out of natural monolithic rock inside a cave, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and holds immense spiritual significance. The moment you step inside, the coolness of the cave and the sacred ambiance instantly evoke a deep sense of peace and reverence.\n\nThe temple is particularly famous for a rare astronomical phenomenon where sunlight passes through the temple's precise architecture and illuminates the Shiva Linga inside the cave on Makar Sankranti. This unique occurrence draws thousands of devotees and tourists alike, highlighting the brilliant blend of devotion and science in ancient Indian temple architecture. The serene environment, echoing chants, and the rock-carved idols leave every visitor awestruck.\n\nA visit is incomplete without receiving the Swamy special prasadam - a humble yet divine offering usually comprising pongal, sweet laddus, and occasionally panaka (jaggery water), especially during festivals. The prasadam is served with devotion, and it's believed to carry the blessings of Lord Gangadhareshwara himself. This temple is not just a place of worship; it is a timeless spiritual marvel in the heart of Bengaluru.\nK.vinoth",

Its origins trace back to the 17th century when Tamil Christian migrants from Gingee settled in the area and built a thatched chapel known as the \"Chapel of Kanikkai Madha.\"  Over the centuries, the church underwent several transformations, culminating in its consecration in 1882.

The basilica also observes special services such as the Divine Mercy Prayer daily at 3:00 PM and Holy Hours on the first Friday of every month from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM  .\n\nAnnual Feast:\nThe basilica is renowned for the St. Mary's Feast, celebrated annually in September.  The festivities commence with a nine-day Novena from August 30th to September 7th, culminating in the grand feast on September 8th, commemorating the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  The celebrations include processions, special Masses, and cultural events, drawing thousands of devotees from across the region  .\n\nVisiting Information:\nLocation: Msgr. F. Noronha Road, Shivajinagar, Bengaluru – 560 051\n\nVisiting Hours: The basilica is open daily from early morning until evening.\n\nAccessibility: Easily accessible via public transportation, with the Shivajinagar Bus Terminus nearby and Cubbon Park Metro Station within close proximity",

As one of the oldest churches in the city, it holds a deep historical and cultural significance, drawing both the faithful and curious visitors alike.\n\nThe Neo-Gothic architecture is striking-tall spires, intricate stained-glass windows, and pointed arches that instantly transport you to another era. The central statue of Mother Mary, seen in the image beautifully adorned in traditional Indian-style robes, radiates grace and serenity. This fusion of local devotion and European design gives the basilica a unique charm.\n\nDespite being located in a bustling area, the church complex remains remarkably peaceful, offering a sacred escape from the noise of the city. The atmosphere is calm and reverent, especially during evening services or quiet weekday visits. You can sit in silence, light a candle, or simply take in the sense of holiness that surrounds the space.\n\nThe annual St. Mary's Feast in September is a major event, drawing thousands for its vibrant celebrations, but on regular days, the church maintains its gentle, spiritual aura.\n\nWhether you're religious or not, St. Mary's Basilica is a must-visit for its historical richness, stunning architecture, and the profound sense of peace it offers.",

Located in Halasuru (Ulsoor), it is one of the oldest temples in the city, dating back to the Chola period. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is an excellent example of Dravidian architecture.\n\nAs you enter the temple premises, you're greeted by intricately carved pillars, detailed sculptures, and a peaceful ambiance that immediately calms the mind. The gopuram (entrance tower) is a visual treat, decorated with colorful idols and traditional motifs. Inside, the sanctum houses the Shiva lingam, where devotees can offer prayers and experience a deep sense of devotion.\n\nThe temple is well-maintained, and the priests are approachable and helpful. It's not overly crowded on regular days, making it a perfect spot for quiet reflection. During festivals like Maha Shivaratri, the temple comes alive with lights, music, and hundreds of devotees.\n\nWhether you're a devotee, a history lover, or someone seeking a peaceful place in the heart of the city, Someshwara Swamy Temple is a must-visit. It's a timeless spiritual gem amidst the modern bustle of Bangalore.",

It was established in 1973 in a rented premises. Construction of current campus building started in 1978. Chief architect Dr Balakrishna V Doshi designed and planned it so beautifully. Local granite stone was used to construct the building. He chose the building at the highest point of the 100 acre area and made multiple level drainage system which ensured smooth flow of rainwater without flooding. Mr Doshi was highly inspired by the temples of Tamil Nadu like Madurai Meenakshi temple and Thanjavur Brihadeeshwara temple which have large corridors and pillars. Same has been implemented in IIMB.\nIIMB campus building is spacious and well ventilated with many open spaces to get natural light. The campus which now looks like built amidst forest was having just 4 trees when it started. IIMB took assistance of horticultural dept to add greenery and it's now filled with beautiful plants, large trees and plenty of birds. Gardener Mayanna developed and maintains the greenery in the campus. He is working here from 40 years and was called back after retirement for his exceptional work.\nIIMB also has a souvenir shop where you can buy t shirts jackets and other stationeries with IIMB logo.\n\nIt's a wonderful campus everyone dreams to study. Make the best use of it. I wish I get an opportunity to study here.\n“Let our study be enlightening”",

The timings shown in Google maps is not that accurate and the security ppl may shoo you off if you go at odd timings .... if you request them , they will allow you to see the church....but am not sure how open they will be -_-\nSo visit it during prayer timings!\nI went here on Saturday at around 3.....\nThe front door was closed but I could go inside from the side-doors .nobody was present inside at the time except for few church caretakers who were cleaning and propping up the place for evening prayer...\nA security guard later came up to me to inform me that taking photos was prohibited all throughout the church grounds !!.... but anyways....there was no signage that says - no photography allowed ! , so I had already taken couple of photos :)\nReaching this place is easy as it's very much beside the mainroad itself and metro is nearby ( need to walk a little but it's manageable)\nThe place is very aesthetic with lots of focus on fine details .... The surroundings are filled with plants and is well maintained ....\nOverall, I loved the fine details like the rows of hanging potted plants everywhere (even inside the church! ...you can see them trailing down near the glass piece) , Bible books kept at every isle, classy glowing round lights, the clock tower,  the coloured tinted glasses and obviously the very artfull glasswork which is soo majestic! Love it :)))))",

Mr. Lester was involved from day 1. We were always of the view that 'form follows the function' giving more importance to usability and maintenance while keeping the aesthetics in mind. We were very impressed when the team showed us the design and we were eager to start the work.\n\nTheir contractor Mr Satish Sharma has an excellent team. They were very particular about process they followed and their workmanship was superb. This house is in single tower high-rise building, which has its own challenges in terms of material movements, noise and dust. However the team took a great care of all these aspects and I never had any complaint from the neighbors or association. We had to relook into few aspects of design during the execution and team was very willing to make the changes and accept our suggestions.\n\nAt the end of the project the house was transformed into a totally a different house. Our guests always in awe and wonder if this apartment is really part of this building. Thank you Lester and team. Your approach to the work is very professional and customer centric. We are very much delighted!",

Completed in 1956, this grand building symbolizes the legislative sovereignty of the people of Karnataka, reflecting a design that merges traditional Indian architectural styles with modern materials like granite, steel, and glass.\nArchitecturally, Vidhan Soudha is striking, characterized by its massive dimensions of 700 feet in length and 350 feet in width. It features a central wing that stands 112 feet tall and houses the Legislative Assembly Chamber. The entrance is marked by a grand staircase with 45 steps, leading to a foyer that offers access to the Assembly Chamber\nThe building's construction involved over 6,000 workers, including many artisans who contributed to its artistic details, utilizing granite sourced from nearby quarries.\nVisitors often admire not only the external grandeur but also the historical significance of the structure, as it stands as a testament to the political evolution of Karnataka. The adjacent Attara Kacheri, which houses the Karnataka High Court, complements the architectural ensemble of this area, showcasing a blend of Gothic and Indo-Saracenic styles",
