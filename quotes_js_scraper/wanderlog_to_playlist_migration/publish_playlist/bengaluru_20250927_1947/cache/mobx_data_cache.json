The surroundings are green and quiet, making it a perfect place for morning walks, light jogging, or simply sitting and enjoying the cool breeze. Many people come here to spend time with family, friends, or even alone to relax and think. You can often see birds flying or sitting by the lake, and their sounds add to the calm feeling of the place. Boating is sometimes available, which is fun for kids and adults. There are benches to sit on, and the lake looks especially beautiful during sunrise and sunset, when the sky reflects on the water. Though the area could use a bit more maintenance in some parts, it still stays clean and safe for visitors. Ulsoor Lake is also close to temples and busy roads, but once you're near the water, it feels like a completely different world—quiet, natural, and refreshing. It’s a nice spot for anyone looking to enjoy a peaceful moment in the middle of the city."

It felt like stepping into a real-life fairy tale — vibrant colors, mesmerizing patterns, and fragrances that made us forget we were in the middle of a bustling city.\n\nThe floral displays were nothing short of magical — from exotic orchids and bonsais to massive floral installations that looked like they belonged in a fantasy movie. 🌺🌸🌼\n\nWe also explored the nursery section, and wow — it’s a hidden gem for any plant lover! 🌿🪴 We picked up a few beautiful plants and pots at surprisingly affordable rates. You could literally start your own mini garden without burning a hole in your pocket.\n\nThe whole experience was well-organized, the crowd was managed decently, and there were plenty of photo-worthy spots around every corner. 📸 If you’re in Bangalore and the flower show is on — don’t miss it. Even if it’s not, Lalbagh itself is a serene escape filled with greenery, history, and natural beauty.\n\nCan’t wait to visit again during the next show! 💚"

Photography of the artwork and interiors is allowed though personal photos inside the gallery are not permitted.

The lush trees, shrubs, and blooming flowers make you feel like you’ve stepped into a little oasis. The entry fee for Indians is just ₹20 – a small price for the peace and beauty you’ll find here.\n\nOnce inside, you’ll be asked to leave your bags at the store near the entrance and collect a token. The main art gallery sits in a charming old building that itself feels like a piece of history. The ground floor is home to the incredible works of the legendary Nandalal Bose, while the upper floors are filled with artworks that truly stop you in your tracks – acrylics, watercolours, oils, mixed media, ink, and pencil sketches, all beautifully displayed.\n\nThe building’s design, its thoughtful upkeep, and the warm politeness of the staff deserve a special mention. Practical touches like the lift, auditorium, washrooms, and a small cafeteria on the ground floor make the visit even smoother."

However, if you have any doubts, there's no one for clarification. I was told that guided tours are conducted on Wednesdays and Saturdays at 4 pm (please call the museum to confirm). Art is subjective, so cannot comment on it. I just want to point out that visit this museum with an open mind, not just by the name of the museum. There were paintings and sculptures (wooden, metal, stone, etc.). While it's kept well in terms of cleanliness and organization, there's lingering foul smell in the hall on the first floor. There's a gift shop, with the items reasonably priced. Behind that you could find the canteen (by the looks of it and the menu, I only purchased a water bottle). And beside the canteen, drinking water and bathrooms (not-so-clean) are available. Art library can be accessed from the adjacent staircase. I spent around 90 minutes, time well spent."

Whether you're a tourist, photographer, or a proud local, standing in front of this majestic structure fills you with awe and pride. 🙏📸\n\n🏢 Architecture & History\nThe Vidhana Soudha is the seat of the Karnataka State Legislature and is one of the largest legislative buildings in India. Its architecture is a majestic blend of Dravidian, Rajasthani, and Indo-Saracenic styles.\nEvery part of this structure — from the massive granite columns to the intricately carved details — showcases the brilliance of Indian craftsmanship. The grandeur of the domes, the towering entrance, and the lush gardens surrounding it make it a visual treat. 🏰🌿\n\n🇮🇳 The building bears the proud inscription: \"Government Work is God's Work\" — a reminder of the building’s purpose and its role in shaping the lives of millions in Karnataka.\n\n📷 Photography Heaven\nThough the building is not open to tourists for internal visits, the outside view is more than enough to impress. The sheer scale, symmetry, and the detailed carvings on this structure are a delight for photography lovers.\nAs you can see in my photos, the morning sunlight, cloudy skies, or evening lights — every time of the day gives it a unique charm. 📸🌤️🌆\n\n🌳 Surroundings\nVidhana Soudha is surrounded by beautifully maintained lawns, iron fencing, and clean surroundings. Located near Cubbon Park and High Court, it’s in the heart of Bengaluru’s administrative zone. The whole area is ideal for a walking tour, especially early in the morning or late evening. 🌳🚶‍♂️\n\n👮 Security & Access\nDue to its political and administrative importance, entry is restricted, and security is tight — which is understandable. You can walk around the perimeter freely and take photos, but getting too close might not be allowed. Make sure to respect the rules and follow security guidelines. 🚫📷\n\n🌇 Best Time to Visit\nEarly morning or post-sunset are ideal times to visit for the best photos. During evenings, the building is beautifully lit with golden lighting that makes it look like a royal palace. If you’re lucky to visit on Republic Day or Karnataka Rajyotsava, the whole area is decorated and feels even more special. ✨🇮🇳\n\n💭 Final Thoughts\nVidhana Soudha isn’t just a building — it’s a symbol of democracy, power, and pride for Karnataka. Its grand presence makes you feel patriotic and respectful of the governance system. I highly recommend including this site in your Bengaluru itinerary, even if it's just for a peaceful walk and a few great pictures. 🌟📷"

This massive granite building, which houses the state legislature of Karnataka, is more than just a government office—it's an impressive work of art and a powerful symbol of post-independence India.\n\nBuilt in the 1950s, its architecture is often described as \"Neo-Dravidian,\" a style that beautifully blends traditional South Indian temple elements with modern design. From the richly carved pillars and arches to the immense, sprawling layout, the building commands attention. At the very top, a striking dome sits, crowned with the four-headed national emblem.\n\nThe most famous feature, and a must-see for visitors, is the inscription on the front: \"Government's Work is God's Work\" in both English and Kannada.While you can't go inside the working government building, simply standing in front of it is an experience in itself. The sheer scale is breathtaking.\n\nThe best time to visit is in the evening, especially on Sundays and public holidays, when the entire structure is illuminated with thousands of lights. It's a truly spectacular sight that makes you appreciate the city's unique blend of tradition and modernity. Vidhana Soudha stands as a testament to the state's heritage and a true landmark for all of India."

Tamarind tree could have been a great all weather venue for functions but unfortunately it isn't one. As you approach towards place meant for function, you have navigate narrow walk ways, constricted entrances, unexpected steps, in short it is not senior citizen friendly, even adults find it annoying. The layout which also includes a pond lacks professional and user friendly touch. Bangalore is prone to unexpected rains and in such a situations, this place would a nightmare. Finally, the dining hall is too small for a venue like this. As I said Tamarind Tree could have been a great place with professional planning but regrettably it Isn't!"

It is a bit overly priced, but I feel it's worth it given the quality and the creativity of each product there. It was surprising that this place had a café too. The food isn't great, yet I'd pay for some average food to sit amidst such cutesy set up. The tea was amazing. They had many varieties too. And it came in a nice classy teapot. As I said, it's on the expensive side, worthy. This place is a bit small and that to me was a disappointment. I would spend all day in a place like that had it been any bigger.\n\nIf you want a soothing, eye-candy ambiance where you just stare and things and satisfy yourself, this is the right place. Evenings are a bit crowded. Noon is the best time to visit as you might have the whole place to yourself."

The dinner plates and serving dishes are really very good and can be great for gifting. Will def visit again for picking up stuff.\nAlso enjoyed the food and coffee at the cafe, however, the food plates given to us were a bit smelly and when asked, the person serving us refused it smelled foul at all. They replaced on our insistence though. That's one thing I din't like about the whole visit, if there's a mistake please admit nicely and apologise, customers won't kill you for that."

I would consider this as a holy place for those who are interested in home decor.  A plethora of beautiful and elegant collection of ceramics, glass, wood, paper, and metal etc to brighten up your office space or home. I especially am fond of their ceramic and metal collection. Quirky and whimsical are definitely the ideal words to describe this store. And now, they have also launched a clothing line made of organic material.   There is also a cafe inside to grab a cuppa if you exhausted after shopping all the cute things."

All the live art and dance performances were fantastic and have unique dimension to them that is usually missing in digital media.\n\nThere were also lots of sets like Titanic and Jurassic Park etc which were surreal and delightful.\n\nOverall it is a great place to go with friends and family 😃"

The park is clean and maintained well. Parking space is enough may be because it's quite far from the city and may not be rushed on weekends like nandi hills. The food included in the Ticket is below average. There is a paid food section which is costly but better than the free one.\n\nActivities are plenty and you will end up spending 5-6 hours. Overall it felt expensive will all the toll you pay and below average food you get included on the Ticket. And the worst part is the Ticket price is more if you don't want the food included. One time visit recommended."

It’s a vibrant and fun-filled destination that gives you a taste of the movie world in a creative and engaging way. The entire space is thoughtfully designed to offer immersive experiences — perfect for all age groups.\n\nSome of the highlights of my visit included walking through Maze Runner, which was thrilling and full of twists! The Lost World was another favorite — with life-sized dinosaur models and prehistoric vibes that made it feel like stepping back in time. The Titanic setup was beautifully recreated and made for some amazing photo ops. Each themed section was well-maintained and truly brought the concepts to life.\n\nI also loved exploring the Miniature City, which was incredibly detailed and showcased tiny replicas of famous landmarks — a real treat for both kids and adults. The live street dance performance brought the whole place alive with music and energy, and added a festive touch to the experience. There’s also a kids' play area that’s perfect for families with young children, offering plenty of activities to keep them engaged and entertained.\n\nOverall, Jollywood offers a wonderful mix of adventure, creativity, and entertainment. Whether you’re looking to explore themed zones, enjoy live performances, or just click some memorable pictures, this place has it all. A highly recommended weekend getaway from Bengaluru!"

              "reviewText": "Ummmm I love this place. It's a must visit for book lovers visiting Bangalore. They have humongous collection of both second hand and new books.\nI especially love the various categories and genres of books they have on display(they even have a separate romance section)!\nThe books are mostly organized in their proper sections but it's a lot of disorganization. But to be frank I don't mind that - because the best part of books is the serendipity of stumbling on books and Blossoms does this spectacularly.\nAlso they delivery within the city without charges (maybe that's available for purchases above a certain value). The manager of the store was very friendly and helpful.\n- 🍀✨Serendipity index - very high\n- 👀 📖☕️ Browsing index - very high, you can sit for hours without anybody disturbing you and juste joy the place or flip through books.Also know that some sections of the store can get musty with ac not working.\n- 🏷️%  Discount/membership - No\n- 🧾🔖📚Secondhand books - Yes a very wide variety available. The prices are a bit steep for second hand books found elsewhere but the place makes up for it with sheet variety of books available so buy accordingly.\n- 🗺️📚Regional books - Average. Limited collection of Hindi and Kannada books. The store is pre dominantly English.\n- 🦹🏼‍♀️ Comics - Huge. I love their collection of magazines, they have so many ! But their condition and maintenance is not the best. A lot of them are chucked into boxes haphazardly and get torn up very easily. Also the comics are not cheap even the second hand ones. Can get for much cheaper from other places but then the titles are harder to find so it's a balancing act. The Manga collection is also huge.\n- ♿ Wheelchair index - Low. While there is a ramp and lift both are nearly useless from a wheelchair user's perspective - ramp is too steep and the lift is a bit narrow to enter.\n- 🅿️🚘Parking - Difficult. There is no parking in front of the store but the metro station entrance is nearby."

You’ll find everything from obscure comics to children’s books to literary classics.\n\nWhen it comes to classics, they stock multiple editions and translations. I personally love the Everyman’s Library prints, and if you look hard enough, you’ll spot a few tucked away in the far corners.\n\nDespite its long-standing popularity, Blossom retains a chill, unpretentious charm that encourages slow, meandering hours of discovery. A must-visit for book lovers!"

There are actually two separate stores: the first one is for music, philosophy, and similar subjects, and just a short walk away there’s a second building. On its first floor is the store I love most. It’s filled with books on psychology, poetry, classic literature, etc.. Outside the store, you can also buy postcards, tote bags, and more. So you really have to set aside at least four hours if you want to visit even once (only if you like hunting for good books)🎯✨️🍀"

Known for its bustling atmosphere and narrow lanes packed with shops, this area is a treasure trove for students, researchers, and literature enthusiasts alike.\n\nThe bookstores here offer an extensive range of books, from academic textbooks and competitive exam guides to novels, rare editions, and second-hand books at bargain prices. Many shops also stock old and out-of-print books, making it an excellent place for those searching for hard-to-find titles. Street vendors add to the charm by selling books at highly discounted rates.\n\nOne of the biggest attractions of Avenue Road is the affordability. Compared to mainstream bookstores, prices here are significantly lower, and shoppers can even negotiate for better deals. However, the sheer number of shops and the crowded environment can be overwhelming for first-time visitors. Additionally, finding a specific book may require some patience and effort.\n\nDespite these minor challenges, Avenue Road remains a must-visit destination for book lovers in Bengaluru. Whether you're looking for academic material or a hidden literary gem, the bookstores here offer something for everyone at unbeatable prices."

The timing was perfect — many wild animals could be seen from quite near, making it exciting and memorable.\n\nThe entry ticket is reasonably priced: ₹120 per adult for the walking trail, and around ₹500 if you choose the electric vehicle (which is more comfortable and covers more ground).\n\nThe park is surrounded by beautiful nature, with greenery and fresh air all around. It’s a peaceful, well-maintained area, perfect for a weekend outing with family or friends.\n\nIf you love wildlife and want to enjoy a relaxed afternoon in nature, this is definitely worth visiting."

It’s a nice getaway from the city hustle, just about an hour from Bangalore. The bus safari was the best part - got to see lions, tigers, and bears up close, safely from the bus. It felt exciting and a bit thrilling too!\n\nThere’s also a zoo inside with a variety of animals, birds, and reptiles. It’s not huge, but it’s fun, especially for kids. The butterfly park was peaceful and colorful - beautifully maintained and a good spot to relax and take photos. This might be very informative for students.\n\nStaff are fantastic, quick and very supportive as I had some confusion on a ticket transaction. Written an email and they responded with all clarifications. Which clearly reflects how efficiently in therms of caring its visitors. Really appreciable.\n\nFood options inside are limited, so it’s a good idea to carry your own snacks and water. Overall, it’s a great place for a day trip with family or friends, especially if you love nature and wildlife. Highly, highly recommended. 😊"

The bus safari combo ticket is highly recommended — it’s affordable and gives access to both the jungle safari and the zoo, making it a great value-for-money package.\n\nThe jungle safari is a must-try experience. It lasts for around 45 minutes, taking you deep into the forest reserve. During the ride, we had the chance to spot majestic animals like lions, tigers, white tigers, leopards, deer, bears, and even elephants. It's thrilling to see these animals in a semi-natural habitat, roaming freely within their designated enclosures.\n\nThe zoo is equally impressive, featuring a wide variety of animals, birds, reptiles, and more. Each enclosure has information displayed about the species, which makes the visit both fun and educational. It's a great place for families and children to learn more about wildlife conservation.\n\nOverall, Bannerghatta National Park offers a well-rounded and enjoyable wildlife experience — adventurous, informative, and ideal for a day trip from Bangalore."

The hassle-free booking process further added to the convenience, making it effortless to secure a spot.\n\nThe studio's sets are undeniably remarkable, showcasing a level of creativity and uniqueness that I haven't encountered elsewhere.

If you cannot take an honest feedback from customers then you better take your location off the google maps.\nThe day i visited this location, i had observed that no proper room facility and washroom facility was available and the roads leading to the location was also in pathetic condition. Also i don't think the fee asked was justified. Don't open such location if you cannot cater to female hygiene. Also word of mouth will definitely affect your business when you are this rude to the customers. I rest my case.\n\n******************************************************************\n\nWhat a waste of a place when you cannot cater to customers. The owners seem to be interested in just minting money without providing a proper hygienic place to rest or go to answer nature's call. Pathetic indeed. I believe all the good 5 star reviews are all paid"

For each couple they give one room, In-fact its called SHED. You will be sweating inside the shed, they have put sheets on top.\n\nIf bride is getting ready, groom has to wait. Its time consuming. Not worth money in that case.\n\nDestination has few sets which are good, and they are constructing few more. Overall I would recommend to avoid this place in SUMMER. Winter may be better!!!!!"

              "reviewText": "ISKCON Temple in Rajajinagar, Bangalore, is a remarkable spiritual destination that impresses visitors with its blend of traditional Dravidian and modern architectural styles. The temple’s glass elements and intricately designed structures create a breathtaking ambiance, making it a visual delight from the moment you enter. The journey into the temple is thoughtfully planned, starting from the beautiful Kalyani (sacred pond) and passing through the 108 footstep station, where chanting the Hare Krishna mantra offers a calming and introspective experience.\n\nThe temple houses several deities, including Lord Prahlada Narasimha Swami, Lord Srinivasa Govinda (Venkateshwara), and the main sanctum dedicated to Sri Krishna Balarama and Sri Radha Krishna Chandra. The presence of Lord Krishna here is especially significant—devotees believe that worshipping at this temple brings peace, happiness, and spiritual upliftment. The regular Sri Krishna sankirtana (devotional singing) fills the air with a sense of tranquility and helps devotees connect deeply with the divine.\n\nThe surroundings are exceptionally clean and well-maintained, and the temple is known for its orderly management and welcoming atmosphere. The staff are respectful, and the entire complex is designed to facilitate a smooth and enriching visit for all. The temple also offers prasadam (blessed food) and has a vegetarian restaurant within the premises, adding to the overall experience.\n\nWhether you are seeking spiritual solace, architectural beauty, or simply a peaceful retreat in the heart of Bangalore, ISKCON Rajajinagar is a must-visit. The divine presence of Lord Krishna and the serene environment make it a place where one can truly feel blessed and rejuvenated."

The temple complex spans a vast area, and it typically takes around 15–20 minutes to walk from the entrance gate to the main sanctum. The atmosphere is serene and divine, offering a peaceful experience despite the weekend crowds. Fortunately, our darshan was smooth and well-managed.\n\nPrasadam is served between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM. In addition to that, there are several food stalls within the temple premises offering light snacks and meals that are prepared and served as prasadam, allowing visitors to enjoy traditional flavors in a devotional setting.\n\nPhotography is not permitted inside the temple, preserving its sanctity; however, visitors are welcome to take photos in the outer areas of the temple complex."

Footwear can be kept in a sack for a nominal charge of ₹5–₹10, or at the free slipper stand. Since I wasn’t carrying any cash and there was no digital payment option, the staff kindly helped me by keeping my slippers safely in a sack.\n\nOne of the most unique aspects was at the first entry level into the sanctum, where every devotee is asked to chant “Hara Krishna Hara Rama” 108 times. With each step, the chant continues until one reaches the first temple dedicated to Lord Narasimha. Photography inside the sanctum is strictly prohibited, which helps preserve the sanctity of the space.\n\nThe sequence of the sanctums is as follows:\n\nFirst: Lord Narasimha, Lord Anjaneya, and Garuda\n\nSecond: Lord Venkatachalapati\n\nFinal: Radha Krishna\n\nInside, one truly feels the divine bliss and a sense of oneness with Lord Krishna. The atmosphere stands out for its cleanliness, absence of beggars, and the fact that no one pressures you to make donations. While special darshan options are available, even the free darshan is fulfilling and complete.\n\nOn the way out, there are stalls with spiritual books such as Lord Krishna Leela and the Bhagavad Gita. A variety of good-quality food items are also available at very reasonable prices. Additionally, hot khichdi prasad is continuously served to devotees, adding to the overall divine experience."

It’s a nice place for families and tourists who want to experience Indian culture and spirituality.\nHowever, they can improve the queue management system to enter the temple, especially during weekends and festivals when it gets very crowded, so weekdays are better for visit.\nOverall, it’s a great place to find peace, pray, and enjoy a spiritual experience."

It was a bit pricey, at 2.5k per person.\n\nHowever, you’ll regret going in with the normal ticket. Each ride requires at least a 40-minute wait.\n\nTo make the most of your time, plan your rides around the 11-7 plan. Start with the least crowded rides first. We began with the Recoil. Sitting in the first seat was a huge and fearful experience, but it was worth it. You’ll be able to see the other rides without feeling so scared.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience, and it was worth every penny."

We started with the land rides, and all of them were equally thrilling and packed with adrenaline. Don’t miss Recoil—it was one of the most exciting and fun rides of the day!\n\nWhen it came to lunch, I felt that opting for a food coupon along with the ticket would’ve been a better deal. The food was quite good in terms of both quality and quantity.\n\nAfter lunch, we headed to the water rides. But in the afternoon, the queues were long. I don’t recall the names of the rides we tried, but they were all great fun and absolutely worth the wait.\n\nThe only disappointing part was that the park closes at 5 PM on weekdays. It would be better if the weekday timings matched the weekend hours to give visitors more time to enjoy everything.\n\nIf you're planning to visit on a weekend, be prepared for heavy crowds and long waiting lines. I highly recommend going for fast-track tickets if you want to make the most of your day.\n\nThey offer locker rooms to keep your valuables safe, with a charge of ₹300 per locker.\n\nAlso, there's plenty of parking space, and the parking is free."

I entered the park around 11:20 AM and stayed until closing at 6:00 PM, and I must say, every minute was worth it.\nFrom the moment I stepped in, the place had a vibrant and energetic vibe. I managed to cover all the land and water rides, which was no small feat – but totally exhilarating. The land rides were packed with thrills – from high-adrenaline roller coasters to fun family-friendly attractions. Each ride was well-maintained and the staff were courteous and helpful throughout.\nThe water rides were a highlight for me – a perfect way to beat the heat. Whether it was the wave pool, lazy river, or the steep water slides, each experience added to the fun. Everything felt safe and clean, which made the whole adventure even more enjoyable.\nThe park was well-organized, and despite the crowds, the queues moved fairly quickly. There were plenty of food options and resting areas, so I never felt overwhelmed.\nOverall, it was a day full of fun, excitement, and unforgettable memories. I’d highly recommend Wonderla to anyone looking for a complete amusement park experience – whether you're an adrenaline junkie or just out to have a great time with friends and family."

The central statue of Mother Mary, seen in the image beautifully adorned in traditional Indian-style robes, radiates grace and serenity. This fusion of local devotion and European design gives the basilica a unique charm.\n\nDespite being located in a bustling area, the church complex remains remarkably peaceful, offering a sacred escape from the noise of the city. The atmosphere is calm and reverent, especially during evening services or quiet weekday visits. You can sit in silence, light a candle, or simply take in the sense of holiness that surrounds the space.\n\nThe annual St. Mary’s Feast in September is a major event, drawing thousands for its vibrant celebrations, but on regular days, the church maintains its gentle, spiritual aura.\n\nWhether you're religious or not, St. Mary’s Basilica is a must-visit for its historical richness, stunning architecture, and the profound sense of peace it offers."

The entry fee is ₹100 per adult and ₹60 per child. Tickets can be purchased at the venue or booked in advance through the BookMyShow app. Advance booking is recommended, especially on weekends.\n\nWe watched a Universe-related show in the theatre, which was quite interesting and immersive. The English pronunciation could have been a bit clearer, and the video could be made more engaging, but overall the show was enjoyable.\n\nThe planetarium also features several space-related exhibits, including models of satellites, rockets, and planets, along with informative displays presented in an engaging manner. Beside the main building, there is a Science Park where kids can enjoy some fun activities. Facilities such as a sitting areas, washrooms, and drinking water are available within the premises.\n\nThe staff appeared polite, though there was a slight delay before entering the show hall. The place is clean, well-maintained, and overall, it was a pleasant experience visiting here."

We attended the “Our Solar System” show at the sky theatre, which was both engaging and informative. The visuals were well-designed and the narration was clear, making it easy for children to grasp complex astronomical concepts in an enjoyable way. It truly sparked excitement and interest among the kids, who were thrilled to learn more about planets, moons, and the wonders of our solar system.\n\nApart from the show, we also explored the Science Park located in the outdoor area of the planetarium. While the concept of the park is excellent—with interactive science exhibits meant to inspire hands-on learning—it clearly shows signs of aging. Many of the exhibits are worn out or non-functional, and the entire space could benefit from better maintenance and refurbishment. Some parts looked neglected, and this takes away from the otherwise educational intent of the park.\n\nOverall, the visit to the planetarium was very enjoyable and is certainly recommended for families with children, especially those who show an early interest in space and science. However, upgrading the science park and giving it a fresh look would definitely enhance the overall experience."

To be fair, the place is well-maintained, clean, and has a beautiful natural setup that sets the right mood for what could be a magical experience. 🌿✨\n\nHowever, the experience felt somewhat underwhelming. For a butterfly park, the number and variety of butterflies were quite limited. More importantly, there was a lack of information and engagement. There’s no one explaining the fascinating life cycle of butterflies, their conservation, or even the species present in the park.\n\nThere was just one curator, who was friendly and approachable, but unfortunately, not very knowledgeable or prepared to interact deeply with visitors. Having seen butterfly parks around the world, I can confidently say that the curators usually bring the space to life—with their stories, passion, and insights. That was clearly missing here.\n\nIf they could invest in a few well-informed and engaging guides or curators, this place would soar in value and visitor satisfaction. Until then, I'm being generous with 3 stars—because I do want to encourage the effort and cleanliness, but it's still a stretch from what this place could and should be.\n\nVerdict: Great idea, decent upkeep, but needs much more heart and expertise to truly flutter. 🦋"

              "reviewText": "Peaceful Nature Escape with Room for Improvement\n\nButterfly Park at Bannerghatta is a wonderful little escape into nature, especially for families, nature lovers, and anyone looking to enjoy a serene and educational experience. Tucked inside the Bannerghatta Biological Park, the butterfly conservatory offers a peaceful retreat from the city buzz, with a large, dome-shaped enclosure filled with lush greenery, flowering plants, and—of course—butterflies.\n\nThe best part is walking through the conservatory and spotting different species fluttering around. It’s quite magical, especially for children. There’s also an informative exhibition hall and a short video presentation that explain the lifecycle of butterflies and their importance to the ecosystem. The displays are engaging and provide a nice educational touch without feeling overwhelming.\n\nThe facilities are generally well-maintained, and the staff is polite and helpful. The pathways are clean and accessible, and there's a small souvenir shop outside selling butterfly-themed merchandise.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the experience could be improved. The butterfly dome could use a little more upkeep—some sections looked a bit worn, and we noticed fewer butterflies than expected, possibly due to seasonal changes or maintenance issues. Also, signage inside the park could be clearer for first-time visitors, especially when navigating from the main zoo entrance to the Butterfly Park.\n\nOverall, it’s a lovely half-day outing that blends learning with leisure. I’d recommend visiting early in the day to avoid crowds and get the best chance to see active butterflies. Definitely worth a visit if you're in or around Bengaluru and want to enjoy a calm, nature-based experience!"

The park is surrounded by lush greenery, creating a serene and tranquil atmosphere. The well-maintained gardens, vibrant flowers, and neatly trimmed lawns add to the park's overall aesthetic appeal. It's a perfect spot to escape the hustle and bustle of the city and immerse yourself in nature's beauty."

This entry fee is also illogical as everything inside have separate additional fee. Also, even after this fee, it is not properly maintained.\nBoats are in really bed shape and looks totally unsafe. I really have doubt that whether they are doing any periodic maintenance or not.\nWater is a bit stinking near the shore.\nMany eateries inside but a bit costly.\nMany rides are available inside.\nWater park is also there but it was closed when we visited there.\n\nFinally, this place has a potential to become one the best tourist attractions in Bangalore but the authority needs to invest money they are making from it.\nFinal word that it can be visited once if you have kids."

Also workers are rude.\nI don't know maybe because we are foreigners or because of language and miss understanding but still they have to talk in a polite manner.\n\nThe Food and other beverages and Ice creams are a little bit high compering to regular prices as most of things are not sold as per the MRP, there is noting special but the place and eating there next the lake.\n\nThere are restrooms clean and maintained.\nAfter the sunset mosquitoes start to be very active, management have to do something.\n\nSome times you will smell a bad smell from the water.\nOther than that, I really enjoyed my time with my family."

The parking is free but getting a space is a big concern. The entry fee for anyone above 3 years is 80/- little higher what I felt. Inside you will get a food court too which doesn't have too many options and will make a hole in the pocket. The food is not so tasty. Overall a good experience can be enjoyed here."

Especially when there is raining, please do visit this place. I recommend couples to spend some time here. It is better to start your journey after 7 o’clock to enjoy the Best night view. The wind will be blowing all over your body. I visited this during Diwali and I could see. It was slightly raining and at the same time I could see rockets bursting out here and there around this cafe and it was such a beautiful view. Please do watch the video.

We booked a table via Zomato and got 50% off on the bill such a great deal!\n\nWe came from HSR, about an hour’s drive, and reached around 9 PM. The weather was windy and cold, but thankfully it wasn’t too crowded. We got a table with a stunning view absolutely magical!\n\nThere are three sections: two open-air and one indoor with a bar and DJ. We tried the pizza and another dish were really good. The staff were a bit busy and it took around 15–20 minutes for the food to arrive, but they were extremely friendly and super helpful especially when it came to taking photos! They patiently helped us capture some amazing shots, which made the experience even more memorable.\n\nNow, let’s talk about the view, it’s mind-blowing. The whole city lights up beneath you, and if you love heights like I do, this place feels like a dream. Even the transparent elevator ride up is exciting you can see the city rise below you as you go higher.\n\nA few tips:\n•\tThey’re open till 1 AM, but food orders close around 12 midnight.\n•\tThere’s free parking right opposite the World Trade Center building. You’ll need to walk a few meters, but the path has a fountain and a nice vibe a lovely little walk before you enter.\n\nIf you love high places, night lights, rooftop vibes, and taking lots of photos — High Ultra Lounge is a must-visit. Can’t wait to go again!"

Antony was my server and he was very warm, patient and sweet. Speaking about the food, it was above average. I'm critiquing above average considering what we are getting for what we are paying. The menu is slightly on the expensive side. However the quantity served depends on your food choices. Some might be good and some may not be. For me the quantity was sufficient. I had ordered small plates of edamame, black pepper crab gatin and Kung pao chicken. They all tasted good but were slightly greasier (except edamame) than expected. I also had ordered the pepperoni and chorizo pizza and korean tenderloin bulgogi for the mains and I must admit that the beef was so well cooked and the sauce was worth relishing. However, you may pass on the pizza. There are better places in Bangalore to find much better ones."

It took them over 20 minutes just to bring us the menu, and honestly, if we hadn’t asked, I doubt we would’ve gotten it at all.\n\nWe were here to celebrate a special occasion, but the experience was a huge letdown.

The only thing going for this place is the altitude and the view — it’s truly beautiful and perfect for photography. The ambience is stunning, and it’s definitely an Instagrammable spot if you’re looking to click some aesthetic pictures.\n\nThe service was good, and the staff was polite and prompt. The drinks were decent, nothing extraordinary but fairly okay. However, everything falls apart when it comes to the food.\n\nI had high expectations, especially for something like crispy lotus stem, which I usually enjoy at other places. But here, it was terribly disappointing — soggy, bland, and completely lacking in flavor. And that pretty much sums up the rest of the food as well. Every dish we tried was below average or outright bad. There was nothing redeeming about the food experience, which is shocking for a place that looks so premium from the outside.\n\nIf you’re heading here just for the vibe and pictures, then it’s worth a short visit. But if you’re looking for a satisfying meal or a good dining experience, this place fails miserably. For the kind of pricing they have, the quality of food is unacceptable.\n\nDefinitely not visiting again for the food. Great view, bad taste."

We tried the Crumbed Fried Chicken, Thai Chilli Hot Basil Prawns, Murg Tikka Platter, and Chicken & Wild Mushroom Thyme Risotto—everything was delicious and well presented. The Hawaiian Coloda was refreshing and perfectly balanced. Great food, good music, and quick service. Definitely worth visiting!"

Amazing ambience, amazing food servers are also super friendly and helpful and the brewery has limited, but really good options. You have to book your table prior because this place was packed and you can’t get a table easily if you have not booked it. Its must try this area.\nFood was really really fresh ingredients they have used is all fresh whatever we ordered was totally up to the mark. I must try you in the area."

This place doesn’t play loud music and actually serves good food. 🤩\n\nWe had a good time here minus a few downsides that otherwise would’ve made the place perfect.\n\nAs I mentioned, the food is actually good. It’s rare that you actually enjoy a meal and can confidently say that. Especially the pork belly. This is one of those places. Too bad one of the starters (a platter) arrived last. Why?\n\nI’m not happy with the fact that you are forced to make an account to order. Why does everything need an account? We had some issues with this and this alone wasted a good 10 minutes. Stop this shit. Let us place the order as is if we wish to. But I can’t deny that they were pretty quick in serving our food (except for the platter).\n\nAnd they also force the service charge BTW.\n\nI enjoyed the beer options here. As suggested by others, two of us ordered the mango ale and it’s true, it is good. I myself ordered the German and Scottish one (whatever the actual name is, I forgot).\n\nThe whole place is in open air and it can get VERY chilly at night so careful with that. A couple mosquitoes but it is what it is.\n\nI would recommend this place for friends and family. Not loud, good food, nice ambience, and actually decent music. Not all the Hindi hits that are simply annoying (my opinion)."

The place is massive, easily accommodating around 100 people, and it’s pet-friendly too – a cute cat even came up to us, making the evening even more delightful. The ambience was top-notch, offering the perfect setting to unwind with friends.\n\nThe food was absolutely exceptional – some of the best I’ve had in Bangalore. Their pizza ranks second only to The Pizza Bakery in my experience, and everything from the pasta to the lasagna was authentic and packed with flavor. Service was prompt and courteous throughout our visit.\n\nThere’s ample car parking available, which adds to the convenience. However, the only downside was being compelled to pay a service charge, which, as per norms, should be optional."

The seating was well-organized, and even though it was a busy day, we were accommodated smoothly.\n\nLoved how tech-friendly the place is—you can scan a QR code to view the menu and place orders hassle-free. There’s also an option to request songs by scanning another QR, which really adds to the vibe!\n\nThe beer options are excellent, with a variety of flavors and add-ons to suit different palates. The ambience is top-notch, spacious and relaxing, making it a great spot to hang out with friends or family.\n\nOne of the highlights was watching the IPL on the big screen, which created a lively, stadium-like atmosphere.\n\nThe desserts were a surprise delight—especially the mango-flavored ones, which were absolutely delicious! They also offer DSLR photo sessions for just ₹150, perfect for capturing memories in style.\n\nOverall, a must-visit for anyone looking to unwind with great food, drinks, and vibes in Bangalore."

However the event as such wasn’t to the expectation. We were given headphones to watch the movie, however there were some external noises, the set up was not exclusively for the event, they had the bar open for others beside the event which was a distraction in a way. There obviously was no STARS view being in the city centre and it was quite humid. The projector or the picture quality was also compromised. 3 course meals were served but I feel they could have given better options to chose the food to our palate. It’s nice one time experience provided you go with zero expectations"

The space is beautifully maintained and the ambience is calm and joyous. Perfect venue for any gathering.\n\nWe have also been here to attend some pop up events in the conservatory. It is a beautiful place with a great ambiance.  Both the times, we got to taste some really unique and good food.  I enjoy their curation and I wish they have more such pop up events with vegan options.\n\nMy only concern is the 100 rupee charge for valet parking.  Given that the events are all priced, this can be exempted and can be made a part of the pricing."

DJ live music was amazing — really brought the whole place to life and kept the energy high all night. Big shoutout to the staff — they were friendly, helpful, and knew their stuff when it came to the menu.

So far, I’ve visited twice, and it definitely lived up to the hype!\n\nThe ambiance is incredible, with beautifully done interiors that set the perfect mood. The service is top-notch—the staff is very helpful, friendly, and the manager is cooperative and understanding, ensuring a smooth experience.\n\nIf you're looking to party, Friday nights are ideal for a lively crowd, while Saturdays are also great but slightly less packed compared to Fridays. If you prefer a quieter experience, it's a good idea to reserve a table at Kaze to sit, eat, or chat, though I personally prefer the bar table.\n\nI highly recommend the prawn tempura and chicken dumplings with chestnuts—they’re both exceptional. For drinks, Kiku is a must-try—it's fancy and fun. Plus, the place is budget-friendly, which is a bonus.\n\nThe crowd here is fantastic, making it a perfect spot to hang out."

I definitely suggest this dish.\nPanko fried chicken was crispy but felt a bit too oily.\nThen finally we ordered their signature mochi ice cream which was so so good. A thin layer of rice sheet and inside is the berry ice cream. This was so worth the price 400₹ for 3 scoops. Alcohol served here is a bit overpriced. The cocktail i ordered was bitter and not skillfully mixed. We also had suntory toki which hiked up the bill. But we had 30% off as we booked through zepto."

The ambiance is peaceful, and the setting is perfect for a relaxed meal.\n\nThe menu has a good variety of options at an affordable price. We ordered a filter coffee (₹120), a cold frappe (₹230), and a spicy lamb pizza (₹400). The pizza was tasty, though it had a thin crust—great for one person with a big appetite or two with a moderate one.\n\nService was quick, and the staff was friendly and attentive. On average, a meal for two would cost around ₹700-₹800, making it a great value for the experience.\n\nOverall, it was a great experience, and I’d definitely visit again!"

The waiting lobby was impressive, with proper chairs, tables, and even a swing-shaped chair. The café ambiance was aesthetic and cozy, perfect for hanging out.\n\nHere’s what we ordered:\n\nHot Chocolate – ₹190\nWarm and comforting. The taste was good.\n\nHalf Veg Half Non-Veg Pizza – ₹400\nThin crust with a pesto spread on the base. The veg portion was delicious, but the non-veg side didn’t taste great.\n\nFrench Croquettes – ₹200\nMixed veggie fingers, served hot and very crispy. We really liked this.\n\nCappuccino – ₹270\nNot up to the mark."

While seating may take some time on weekends, the wait is well worth it.\nBut the online ordering system is kinda weird. You place your order online, but then the waiter still has to come over to confirm it. Doesn't make sense.\nTheir menu is simple and direct.\nThe stuffed mushrooms were really good and the mushroom sandwich was simply amazing.\nThe pineapple lime juice was very refreshing.\nOverall a great experience at this cafe and will definitely visit again."

I may be biased but this is probably the best place to eat out in this area and the garden ambience really adds to a relaxing day out if you’re planning one. Great place to eat out by yourself and have a nice, quiet day too.\nThe staff here are really the highlight. They are super polite and friendly.\nAs for the food - no bad item on the menu really. Everything feels freshly made and perfectly cooked/seasoned.\n\nMy favorite ones I’d recommend are the fig salad, ice tea, palak paneer and banana loaf."

It's a little out of the way in a quiet part of Basavanagudi, so it's ideal for a lazy weekend lunch.\n\nI've been there twice this year.\n\nFirst time:\nIced Tea - Rs. 125\nPotato Wedges - Rs. 245\nPan Fried Fish - Rs. 615\n\nThe Iced Tea wasn't very tea-ish, but the wedges and fish were great.\n\nSecond time:\nSummer Cooler - Rs. 215\nAlleppey Fish curry with rice - Rs. 685\nMushroom Toasties - Rs. 295\n\nI liked all that was served. The fish curry had mango in it if I'm not mistaken. It was a special for the day, so not on the menu.\n\nMost of the mains are in the 500-600 range, so not an economical restaurant so to speak, but the quality always meets expectations.\n\nRecommended if you're ever in this neck of the woods."

The food was the real star — the salad was flavorful, well-balanced, and beautifully presented.\n\nI tried their signature salad, The Mango Avocado & Almond Salad and the Summer Cooler. The salad stood out with its freshness and unique twist on classic flavours. The staff were polite, attentive, and made sure we had a smooth dining experience.\n\nSpecial mention to the presentation and portion sizes — generous without being overwhelming. Whether you’re looking for a casual lunch or a special meal with friends or family, Elephant Rouge hits the mark. Definitely coming back soon!"

The banana cake is awesome! It's freshly made and you can feel the warmth!\nWith that they give butter and the combo is really amazing! It is not too sweet! Yet feels like awesome dessert.\nI have tried their sandwich, it's pretty good as well.\nThe pricing is a bit on the higher side!\nBut you are planning for fancy food, you can go for it.

Before going into any further details, want to confess that I was awestruck with the beauty of the place. From the moment we reached the place, the next couple of minutes were speechless internalizing the decor and artistic look & feel of the place. The place is huge with lot of space, both indoors and outdoors. Though every nook and corner of the place is treat for the eyes, I particularly like the veranda (backyard) of sorts with ample sitting in the natural environs.\n\nWe were allotted a beautiful room for ourselves, with an artistic grandeur, couple of chairs and tables, bar stools, a television screen with projector capability and a tea / coffee vending machine. To add to the experience, was a delightful service provided by none other than Marzipan Cafe, which needs no introductions.\n\nThe day was spent planning & brainstorming with colleagues, accompanied with yummy delights from Marzipan. There was no stop put to the yummy Cappuccinos, Lattes & Americanos, accompanied with the out-of-world freshly baked cookies. If you do, don't forget to try their melt-in-the-mouth Ragi cookie - which is beyond anyone's comprehension. We also tried other bakery items that were on display, like the Puffs, Tyropita & Quiche. We also ordered a Mushroom Melt Sandwich, which again was worth the try, amazingly fresh & delicious. The desserts at Marzipan are the showstoppers and are not to be missed at any cost, particularly the Marzipan Cake, Banoffee Pie & Banana Nutella Cake.\n\nDo visit the place & guaranteed that you will fall in love with it !"

              "reviewText": "Review of Jollywood bangalore\n\nOur group of 15+ people, including children and ladies, booked tickets in advance online using the Buy 3 Get 1 Free offer. The booking process was smooth, and we were excited for our visit.\n\nArrival & Entry:\n\nWe arrived at the park at the opening time and were greeted with a welcome flash mob, which set an energetic tone for the day. Parking was ample and convenient, making the entry hassle-free.\n\nAttractions & Rides:\n\nOur adventure began with a 5D cinema experience, which was thrilling. This was followed by a bull ride , and a bouncy castle for the kids. However, the bouncy castle's slide was too steep, making it less enjoyable for younger children.\n\nThere are a few other small experiences like titanic , village theme etc\n\nThe Jollylucious segment stood out with its indoor play area, which was a delight for the little ones. Next, we explored the Dino Ride, ideal for kids aged 3-7 years, and its adjoining museum, which was informative.\n\nWe then moved on to the dry rides and water park area. The water slides had a maximum weight limit of 85-90 kg for three slides, but there were no restrictions for the rest, ensuring everyone could enjoy.\n\nThe Mirror Maze was another highlight, offering a fun and slightly challenging experience. However, we were disappointed that the wave pool was under maintenance, as it would have been a great addition to our day.\n\nFood & Refreshments:\n\nFor lunch, we visited the food court, which had a wide variety of options catering to different tastes. The quality and variety were satisfying, making it a great pit stop before continuing our adventure.\n\nFor snacks we had some pop corn and choclates\n\nEvening Entertainment & Conclusion:\n\nAs the day progressed, we enjoyed the stage dance performance, which added a lively touch to the experience. The park concluded the day with a colorful parade, making for a memorable ending.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nThe lack of crowds due to exam time meant no long wait times for rides, enhancing our overall experience. While a few aspects like the steep bouncy castle slide and the wave pool maintenance were minor letdowns, the park still delivered a fun-filled and enjoyable day.\n\nOverall Rating: (4/5) A great spot for families and groups looking for a mix of adventure, entertainment, and relaxation!"

The server didn't bother to refill the water, gave the bill and disappeared, fries had a burnt flavor, the pork ribs cooked well though were accompanied by an exceedingly sweet pineapple sauce which seems like a mistake, the cheese cake was average, chicken schnitzel tasted like store bought chicken nuggets.\n\nInteriors are well done, full marks to whoever designed and executed them!"

Amidst a long list of premium restaurants, there is the newest addition where the opulent look is beautifully blended with vintage and vibrancy. Coming to food, this is one of the very few places where we were so fascinated with lip-smacking appetizers that we had zero bandwidth to even look for main course. They do fusion with global cuisine very uniquely and it makes you indulge irresistibly. If you are on a diet, think before you zero in this venue 😉"

Overall, I had a positive experience at the restaurant.  The service was attentive and friendly throughout the meal. The service Guy named Risi helped me a lot and he was very friendly and I had a great meal which was fabulous and Tasty 😋 ...\n\nI particularly enjoyed the variety of dishes on the menu. The food was flavorful and well-prepared. The Budha Bowl I ordered was a highlight; it was delicious and exceeded my expectations. I also enjoyed the delicious cocktail named Berry basil caipiroska..\n\nHowever, there were a couple of areas where I would love to stay all day . The wait time for our food was Not so much late it was somehow quick , and it would be great if this could be reduced in the future. Additionally, the portion size of some dishes seemed a bit small for the price But it doesn't matters because the food taste was enough..\n\nDespite these minor issues, I would definitely consider returning to Sly granny in the future. The overall dining experience was enjoyable, and I appreciate the effort put into creating a pleasant atmosphere and delicious food.\n\nThank you for providing a great dining experience, and I look forward to visiting again."

I recently had the pleasure of indulging in a gastronomic journey at this Bangalore gem, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint!\n\nStarting with the drinks, I tried the Posh G&T, Fresh Lime Soda, Berry & Basil, and Caprioska, and each one was a refreshing and burst of flavor.\n\nMoving on to the appetisers,We tried the Granny's House Salad, Mezze platter, Grilled Figs And Goat Cheese, and Yam Kulcha. The salad was fresh and crisp, the Mezze was a flavorful and colorful delight, the Grilled Figs And Goat Cheese can be improved and it was more of a breakfast dish than an appetiser and the Yam Kulcha was a unique take on the traditional Indian bread. We loved it and give it a whopping 10/10 for this dish.\n\nFor the main course, I had the Three Bean Taco and the Gnocchi, and both were fantastic. The Three Bean Taco was a flavor explosion in my mouth, with perfectly seasoned beans and a soft tortilla and I couldn't get enough of. The Gnocchi was pillowy and delicious, with a creamy sauce\n.\nAnd last but not least, the dessert. I indulged in the Dark Chocolate Truffle, and it was the perfect ending to an already amazing meal. Rich, decadent, and perfectly balanced. However I'm going back here to try the cheesecake as there was lots of ooooos and awwws from the neighbouring table !!!!\n.\nOverall, my experience at Sly Granny was fantastic. Giving it an overall 4/5 stars. The ambience was charming and eclectic, and the food was creative, flavorful, and expertly executed. I can't wait to come back and try more of their dishes!"

The victorian styled bungalow and the surrounding courtyard gives you a rustic feel and is just what we needed for a intimate and romantic engagement. Anjali who owns Rings and Roses was the event planner and she was just perfect for us. She helped us plan our ONAM themed engagement with the perfect ambience and decor.The best part is each and every intricate detail is well planned and a lot of skill is put into it. Thank you Rings and Roses and Bungalow 7 for a surreal engagement party.If you love an intimate ceremony, this is the place to be!"

The intricate details on the facade are a testament to the craftsmanship of a bygone era—truly a treat for history and architecture lovers.\n\nIt’s not just a historic site but also an important metro stop, with easy access to the High Court and Cubbon Park. However, the main road outside is extremely busy, and there’s very limited open space in front, so be cautious while visiting—especially if you're on foot or with children.\n\nDespite that, it’s widely considered a must-visit location when in Bangalore. A great place to soak in the civic pride and cultural legacy of the city!"

Whether you're a tourist, photographer, or a proud local, standing in front of this majestic structure fills you with awe and pride. 🙏📸\n\n🏢 Architecture & History\nThe Vidhana Soudha is the seat of the Karnataka State Legislature and is one of the largest legislative buildings in India. Its architecture is a majestic blend of Dravidian, Rajasthani, and Indo-Saracenic styles.\nEvery part of this structure — from the massive granite columns to the intricately carved details — showcases the brilliance of Indian craftsmanship. The grandeur of the domes, the towering entrance, and the lush gardens surrounding it make it a visual treat. 🏰🌿\n\n🇮🇳 The building bears the proud inscription: \"Government Work is God's Work\" — a reminder of the building’s purpose and its role in shaping the lives of millions in Karnataka.\n\n📷 Photography Heaven\nThough the building is not open to tourists for internal visits, the outside view is more than enough to impress. The sheer scale, symmetry, and the detailed carvings on this structure are a delight for photography lovers.\nAs you can see in my photos, the morning sunlight, cloudy skies, or evening lights — every time of the day gives it a unique charm. 📸🌤️🌆\n\n🌳 Surroundings\nVidhana Soudha is surrounded by beautifully maintained lawns, iron fencing, and clean surroundings. Located near Cubbon Park and High Court, it’s in the heart of Bengaluru’s administrative zone. The whole area is ideal for a walking tour, especially early in the morning or late evening. 🌳🚶‍♂️\n\n👮 Security & Access\nDue to its political and administrative importance, entry is restricted, and security is tight — which is understandable. You can walk around the perimeter freely and take photos, but getting too close might not be allowed. Make sure to respect the rules and follow security guidelines. 🚫📷\n\n🌇 Best Time to Visit\nEarly morning or post-sunset are ideal times to visit for the best photos. During evenings, the building is beautifully lit with golden lighting that makes it look like a royal palace. If you’re lucky to visit on Republic Day or Karnataka Rajyotsava, the whole area is decorated and feels even more special. ✨🇮🇳\n\n💭 Final Thoughts\nVidhana Soudha isn’t just a building — it’s a symbol of democracy, power, and pride for Karnataka. Its grand presence makes you feel patriotic and respectful of the governance system. I highly recommend including this site in your Bengaluru itinerary, even if it's just for a peaceful walk and a few great pictures. 🌟📷"

This massive granite building, which houses the state legislature of Karnataka, is more than just a government office—it's an impressive work of art and a powerful symbol of post-independence India.\n\nBuilt in the 1950s, its architecture is often described as \"Neo-Dravidian,\" a style that beautifully blends traditional South Indian temple elements with modern design. From the richly carved pillars and arches to the immense, sprawling layout, the building commands attention. At the very top, a striking dome sits, crowned with the four-headed national emblem.\n\nThe most famous feature, and a must-see for visitors, is the inscription on the front: \"Government's Work is God's Work\" in both English and Kannada.While you can't go inside the working government building, simply standing in front of it is an experience in itself. The sheer scale is breathtaking.\n\nThe best time to visit is in the evening, especially on Sundays and public holidays, when the entire structure is illuminated with thousands of lights. It's a truly spectacular sight that makes you appreciate the city's unique blend of tradition and modernity. Vidhana Soudha stands as a testament to the state's heritage and a true landmark for all of India."

              "reviewText": "As a history enthusiast visiting Bangalore in late August 2025, I decided to explore the Tipu Sultan Summer Palace (also known as Daria Daulat Bagh), a well-preserved relic from the 18th century. Located in the heart of Srirangapatna, just a short 15-20 km drive from central Bangalore, this palace served as the summer retreat of Tipu Sultan, the \"Tiger of Mysore,\" and stands as a testament to his innovative spirit and architectural prowess. Built in 1784, it's one of the few surviving structures from Tipu's era, showcasing Indo-Islamic design with intricate woodwork that immediately captivated me.\nUpon arrival, the palace's modest entrance belies the treasures inside. The main building is constructed primarily from teak wood, but what truly stood out was the liberal use of sandalwood in the decorations, carvings, and artifacts on display. Tipu Sultan was known for his fondness for sandalwood – a fragrant, durable wood native to Karnataka – and the palace features beautiful inlaid panels and motifs made from it, adding a luxurious, aromatic touch to the interiors. The museum within houses an impressive collection of Tipu's personal items, including swords, coins, and paintings, many of which incorporate sandalwood elements. One highlight was the ornate wooden cradle and ceremonial objects, all crafted from this precious material, evoking the opulence of the Mysore Kingdom. The scent of aged sandalwood lingers subtly, enhancing the immersive experience.\nWandering through the lush gardens surrounding the palace, I appreciated the serene ambiance – perfect for a half-day visit. The audio guide (available for a small fee) provides fascinating insights into Tipu's battles against the British and his administrative reforms. However, the site can get crowded on weekends, so I recommend visiting early morning. Entry is affordable at around ₹20 for Indians (₹200 for foreigners), and photography is allowed inside.\nFor anyone interested in sandalwood craftsmanship, this palace is a must-see, as it exemplifies how the wood was used in royal settings. If you're in Bangalore, pair it with a trip to nearby sandalwood-focused spots like the Government Sandalwood Depot or local artisan shops in Srirangapatna, where you can see modern carvings and even purchase small souvenirs made from certified sandalwood. Overall, the Tipu Sultan Summer Palace earns a solid 4.5/5 stars from me – a blend of history, culture, and natural artistry that leaves you inspired. Highly recommended for a culturally enriching outing!.."

They don't have their own parking lot for visitors coming by their own vehicle, the security personnel guided me to park my vehicle in SBI Bank's building in front which is just three buildings ahead of this palace. There security took rs. 20 for parking (unofficially). The ticket will cost Rs.20 per adult. They don't have a physical ticket counter, we have to scan a QR code present near the entry gate and after payment a ticket will be issued online which we have to show the security guard. The palace has two gardens first just in front of the main palace and the second one just beside it. The palace is not that big. Within 45 minutes you can explore this one with good photos. The photos coming are awesome. Most of the part of the palace is made of wood and mud which makes it special. We can see mughal architecture here. Have toilet and water facilities within a ticket cost."

Carved out of natural monolithic rock inside a cave, the temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and holds immense spiritual significance. The moment you step inside, the coolness of the cave and the sacred ambiance instantly evoke a deep sense of peace and reverence.\n\nThe temple is particularly famous for a rare astronomical phenomenon where sunlight passes through the temple’s precise architecture and illuminates the Shiva Linga inside the cave on Makar Sankranti. This unique occurrence draws thousands of devotees and tourists alike, highlighting the brilliant blend of devotion and science in ancient Indian temple architecture. The serene environment, echoing chants, and the rock-carved idols leave every visitor awestruck.\n\nA visit is incomplete without receiving the Swamy special prasadam — a humble yet divine offering usually comprising pongal, sweet laddus, and occasionally panaka (jaggery water), especially during festivals. The prasadam is served with devotion, and it's believed to carry the blessings of Lord Gangadhareshwara himself. This temple is not just a place of worship; it is a timeless spiritual marvel in the heart of Bengaluru.\nK.vinoth"

Photography of the artwork and interiors is allowed though personal photos inside the gallery are not permitted. There's a lovely outdoor space for pictures and a cozy café to unwind.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking for a calm, enriching day out in Bangalore."

The ground floor is home to the incredible works of the legendary Nandalal Bose, while the upper floors are filled with artworks that truly stop you in your tracks – acrylics, watercolours, oils, mixed media, ink, and pencil sketches, all beautifully displayed.\n\nThe building’s design, its thoughtful upkeep, and the warm politeness of the staff deserve a special mention. Practical touches like the lift, auditorium, washrooms, and a small cafeteria on the ground floor make the visit even smoother."

There is a cafe , souvenir shop (both of them offer reasonable price for everything) as well as an art archive above the cafeteria. Personal photographs are not allowed, though you can take photos of the gallery. The security guards were not really welcoming, they kept on following us everywhere, which felt a bit intimidating"

However, I didn’t quite understand the rules around not being allowed to take videos of the place/pictures of yourself next to the art. Respected it regardless, of course, but the constant presence of staff in each room, closely watching and following visitors, made the experience a bit uncomfortable. I get that they’re there to ensure the rules are followed, but the way it was handled felt a little intrusive."

Every room has security personnel that are doing their job diligently, at times it feels like they are stalking you 😅 but they are super friendly and helpful. However, if you have any doubts, there's no one for clarification. I was told that guided tours are conducted on Wednesdays and Saturdays at 4 pm (please call the museum to confirm). Art is subjective, so cannot comment on it. I just want to point out that visit this museum with an open mind, not just by the name of the museum. There were paintings and sculptures (wooden, metal, stone, etc.). While it's kept well in terms of cleanliness and organization, there's lingering foul smell in the hall on the first floor. There's a gift shop, with the items reasonably priced. Behind that you could find the canteen (by the looks of it and the menu, I only purchased a water bottle). And beside the canteen, drinking water and bathrooms (not-so-clean) are available. Art library can be accessed from the adjacent staircase. I spent around 90 minutes, time well spent."

They were disciplined, thoughtful, and insightful. They offered creative solutions and ensured accountability to deadlines and milestones. As they demonstrated their excellence and ensured our dream is met.\n\nWithout saying, his team includes Ms. Hema and Mr. Bharath who made us comfortable in every step and partnered and always reachable on phone/in person for any clarification. Timely site visit and coordination with contractors ensure smooth implementation according to design and plan.\n\nAshwin and his team goes beyond the call of duty - Probably this is a WOW factor in them which strengthen the client relationship. It took 2 years to complete the project, but we must agree that every detail in the design has made our house stand tall. Once Ashwin mentioned in our meeting and I quote - “ He would like to design our home, which doesn’t require any changes for next two decades”. We were able to correlate his words once we moved. Any guest who walks-in to our home will drop their jaws and tell us that we have a good taste for the architecture :-) - Truth is this is designed by the one of the best Architect team in Bangalore.\n\nWe are sure, like us many would be dreaming of one such home and they can be rest assured giving the project to Mr. Ashwin will not disappoint.\n\nOur home - “Duhitha” pictures well tell the rest of the story.\n\nWe are thankful for Mr. Ashwin and his team for this beautiful house. We wish them all the best for their upcoming project.\n\nArjun & Family"

Sofas, curtains, woodwork and landscapes - all were carefully designed to make the whole house look very aesthetically pleasing.\n\nAshwin and Anshul bring in immense experience to the game. Their design was focused on building a fully functional house. There’s deep thought behind every single inch of space. They’re with you at every step of the process. They educate you about where to spend and more importantly where not to.\n\nAll in all, it worked out great for us and I highly recommend Ashwin and Team."

The architect team was with us right from choosing all the vendors, procurement, and quality checks during the entire construction.\n\nWe are delighted with the excellent output. Thank you Ashwin, Hema & Anshul, for all your efforts."

Mr. Lester was involved from day 1. We were always of the view that 'form follows the function' giving more importance to usability and maintenance while keeping the aesthetics in mind. We were very impressed when the team showed us the design and we were eager to start the work.\n\nTheir contractor Mr Satish Sharma has an excellent team. They were very particular about process they followed and their workmanship was superb. This house is in single tower high-rise building, which has its own challenges in terms of material movements, noise and dust. However the team took a great care of all these aspects and I never had any complaint from the neighbors or association. We had to relook into few aspects of design during the execution and team was very willing to make the changes and accept our suggestions.\n\nAt the end of the project the house was transformed into a totally a different house. Our guests always in awe and wonder if this apartment is really part of this building. Thank you Lester and team. Your approach to the work is very professional and customer centric. We are very much delighted!"

The first time we met Mr.Lester Rozario, Chief architect of Kamat and Rozario architecture, this gentleman patiently listened to all our requirements and noted down all the specifics for the project.  After a couple of rounds of discussion and on liking their approach towards planning and designing we decided to go ahead with them. That perhaps, is one of the best decision we had ever taken, enabling us to write our experience with them from the comfort of new beautiful home. Throughout our journey with them for more than year, these people have always exhibited a thorough professionalism and their passion for architecture. Mr. Lester Rozario and his team of young architects literally hand held us throughout the project and offered valuable suggestions at every point, without interfering with our individual decision. Without them our dream home would have remained only dream. A special thanks to Lester and project architects Mrigank, Sinan and Taniyat. We thank this young team of honest and passionate professionals and wish them all success."

We saw the houses they had built. The owners of these houses spoke very well of them. So, we met with Lester and Smruti of M/s Kamat and Rozario Architects for consultation. They are a husband and wife team, the new generation architects with a new outlook and innovative ideas, and pleasing manners. What I find standout in them is: for them work is worship, a dedication and not an easy means to spin money. They do the work they undertake with honesty and sincerity to the satisfaction of the investor. Their work is  a notch above others in quality and style with an aesthetic appeal. The feature in \"50 Beautiful Houses In India\" of our house is a proof of their architectural talents.\n\nWe have great pleasure in wishing them a bright future.\n\nThomas V. A."

Its origins trace back to the 17th century when Tamil Christian migrants from Gingee settled in the area and built a thatched chapel known as the \"Chapel of Kanikkai Madha.\"  Over the centuries, the church underwent several transformations, culminating in its consecration in 1882.  In 1973, it was granted the status of a minor basilica by Pope Paul VI, making it the sixth church in India to receive this honor  .\n\nMass Timings:\nSt. Mary's Basilica offers daily Masses in multiple languages, catering to the diverse congregation.  Masses are conducted in English, Tamil, Kannada, Konkani, and Malayalam at various times throughout the week.  The basilica also observes special services such as the Divine Mercy Prayer daily at 3:00 PM and Holy Hours on the first Friday of every month from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM  .\n\nAnnual Feast:\nThe basilica is renowned for the St. Mary's Feast, celebrated annually in September.  The festivities commence with a nine-day Novena from August 30th to September 7th, culminating in the grand feast on September 8th, commemorating the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  The celebrations include processions, special Masses, and cultural events, drawing thousands of devotees from across the region  .\n\nVisiting Information:\nLocation: Msgr. F. Noronha Road, Shivajinagar, Bengaluru – 560 051\n\nVisiting Hours: The basilica is open daily from early morning until evening.\n\nAccessibility: Easily accessible via public transportation, with the Shivajinagar Bus Terminus nearby and Cubbon Park Metro Station within close proximity"

As one of the oldest churches in the city, it holds a deep historical and cultural significance, drawing both the faithful and curious visitors alike.\n\nThe Neo-Gothic architecture is striking—tall spires, intricate stained-glass windows, and pointed arches that instantly transport you to another era. The central statue of Mother Mary, seen in the image beautifully adorned in traditional Indian-style robes, radiates grace and serenity. This fusion of local devotion and European design gives the basilica a unique charm.\n\nDespite being located in a bustling area, the church complex remains remarkably peaceful, offering a sacred escape from the noise of the city. The atmosphere is calm and reverent, especially during evening services or quiet weekday visits. You can sit in silence, light a candle, or simply take in the sense of holiness that surrounds the space.\n\nThe annual St. Mary’s Feast in September is a major event, drawing thousands for its vibrant celebrations, but on regular days, the church maintains its gentle, spiritual aura.\n\nWhether you're religious or not, St. Mary’s Basilica is a must-visit for its historical richness, stunning architecture, and the profound sense of peace it offers."

              "reviewText": "The Someshwara Swamy Temple in Bangalore is a beautiful blend of spiritual serenity and rich history. Located in Halasuru (Ulsoor), it is one of the oldest temples in the city, dating back to the Chola period. The temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is an excellent example of Dravidian architecture.\n\nAs you enter the temple premises, you're greeted by intricately carved pillars, detailed sculptures, and a peaceful ambiance that immediately calms the mind. The gopuram (entrance tower) is a visual treat, decorated with colorful idols and traditional motifs. Inside, the sanctum houses the Shiva lingam, where devotees can offer prayers and experience a deep sense of devotion.\n\nThe temple is well-maintained, and the priests are approachable and helpful. It's not overly crowded on regular days, making it a perfect spot for quiet reflection. During festivals like Maha Shivaratri, the temple comes alive with lights, music, and hundreds of devotees.\n\nWhether you're a devotee, a history lover, or someone seeking a peaceful place in the heart of the city, Someshwara Swamy Temple is a must-visit. It’s a timeless spiritual gem amidst the modern bustle of Bangalore."

              "reviewText": "Nestled in the heart of Halasuru, Bengaluru Sri Someshwara Swamy Temple is a revered Shiva temple believed to be over 1500 years old, with its present structure attributed to the 13th-century Chola rulers. Though inscriptions or historical documents are absent, strong oral traditions preserve its sanctity and history.\n\nAccording to legend, Sri Jayappa Gowda, the King of Yelahanka, once rested here during a hunting expedition. In a dream, Lord Someshwara revealed his presence within an anthill and recounted how he was once worshipped by the sage Mandavya Muni. Distressed by the decline in devotion, unity, and dharma, the Lord urged the king to build a temple at the site. He obliged, and the idol of Sri Someshwara Swamy was installed and consecrated.\n\nThe deity is known to bless devotees with marital harmony, progeny, and relief from afflictions like Apamrityu Dosha and Janma-Mrityu Dosha. Rituals such as Mahabhisheka, Rudrabhisheka, and Panchamruthabhisheka are integral to the temple’s spiritual calendar.\n\nRegular Mahabhisheka and Mahamangalarathi are conducted every Monday. Festivals such as Pradosha, Maha Shivaratri, Karthika Masa Puja, Shiva Deepotsava, Brahmotsava, and Pallaki Utsava draw large gatherings. Particularly during Karthika Masa and Magha Masa, devotees seek blessings through Deeparadhane, believed to bring auspicious outcomes.\n\nThe temple architecture features stone pillars with intricate carvings of deities like Ganesha, Vishnu, and Shiva. While a sacred pond exists within the corridor, devotees are not permitted to use it. Offerings of lemon and coconut placed near the Lord are later distributed as prasadam.\n\nDespite the lack of renovation records by kings or Palegars, the temple continues to be a beacon of unwavering faith, spiritual legacy, and community devotion.\n\nThe temple is managed by the Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments (HRCE), Govt. of Karnataka, and it is well maintained. There's a designated counter for booking poojas and archana tickets, which is convenient for devotees looking for a more involved ritual experience.\n\nThe temple complex is home to multiple shrines of Lord Someshwara (Shiva) – the presiding deity, Maa Kaamakshi, Lord Ganesha, Subrahmanya (Kartikeya), Navagrahas, Kaalbhairav, Hanuman, Omkareshwar, Arunachaleshwar, Dakshinamurthy, Lord Vishnu, Brahma, Chandikeshwara and several others.\n\nThe mantapam (pillared hall) is a special space—don’t forget to sit and meditate here. The silence, energy, and timeless ambience make it a truly surreal experience, offering rare mental stillness in a bustling city.\n\nThings to note:\n\n- Parking is tight and difficult due to the temple’s location in a densely packed urban area. Best to use public transport or park near Halasuru metro station and walk down.\n\n- A free footwear stand is available near the entrance.\n\n- Mornings are generally quieter and more conducive for darshan and meditation.\n\n- Cleanliness and overall administration are commendable."

The timings shown in Google maps is not that accurate and the security ppl may shoo you off if you go at odd timings .... if you request them , they will allow you to see the church....but am not sure how open they will be -_-\nSo visit it during prayer timings!\nI went here on Saturday at around 3.....\nThe front door was closed but I could go inside from the side-doors .nobody was present inside at the time except for few church caretakers who were cleaning and propping up the place for evening prayer...\nA security guard later came up to me to inform me that taking photos was prohibited all throughout the church grounds !!.... but anyways....there was no signage that says - no photography allowed ! , so I had already taken couple of photos :)\nReaching this place is easy as it's very much beside the mainroad itself and metro is nearby ( need to walk a little but it's manageable)\nThe place is very aesthetic with lots of focus on fine details .... The surroundings are filled with plants and is well maintained ....\nOverall, I loved the fine details like the rows of hanging potted plants everywhere (even inside the church! ...you can see them trailing down near the glass piece) , Bible books kept at every isle, classy glowing round lights, the clock tower,  the coloured tinted glasses and obviously the very artfull glasswork which is soo majestic! Love it :)))))"

I tried the fried chicken and pork sliders, and both were super tasty.\n\nThey also had some fun activities and events going on, which kept the energy up.

However the event as such wasn’t to the expectation. We were given headphones to watch the movie, however there were some external noises, the set up was not exclusively for the event, they had the bar open for others beside the event which was a distraction in a way. There obviously was no STARS view being in the city centre and it was quite humid. The projector or the picture quality was also compromised. 3 course meals were served but I feel they could have given better options to chose the food to our palate. It’s nice one time experience provided you go with zero expectations"

It is a beautiful place with a great ambiance.  Both the times, we got to taste some really unique and good food.  I enjoy their curation and I wish they have more such pop up events with vegan options.\n\nMy only concern is the 100 rupee charge for valet parking.

It was established in 1973 in a rented premises. Construction of current campus building started in 1978. Chief architect Dr Balakrishna V Doshi designed and planned it so beautifully. Local granite stone was used to construct the building. He chose the building at the highest point of the 100 acre area and made multiple level drainage system which ensured smooth flow of rainwater without flooding. Mr Doshi was highly inspired by the temples of Tamil Nadu like Madurai Meenakshi temple and Thanjavur Brihadeeshwara temple which have large corridors and pillars. Same has been implemented in IIMB.\nIIMB campus building is spacious and well ventilated with many open spaces to get natural light. The campus which now looks like built amidst forest was having just 4 trees when it started. IIMB took assistance of horticultural dept to add greenery and it’s now filled with beautiful plants, large trees and plenty of birds. Gardener Mayanna developed and maintains the greenery in the campus. He is working here from 40 years and was called back after retirement for his exceptional work.\nIIMB also has a souvenir shop where you can buy t shirts jackets and other stationeries with IIMB logo.\n\nIt’s a wonderful campus everyone dreams to study. Make the best use of it. I wish I get an opportunity to study here.\n“Let our study be enlightening”"

Completed in 1956, this grand building symbolizes the legislative sovereignty of the people of Karnataka, reflecting a design that merges traditional Indian architectural styles with modern materials like granite, steel, and glass.\nArchitecturally, Vidhan Soudha is striking, characterized by its massive dimensions of 700 feet in length and 350 feet in width. It features a central wing that stands 112 feet tall and houses the Legislative Assembly Chamber. The entrance is marked by a grand staircase with 45 steps, leading to a foyer that offers access to the Assembly Chamber\nThe building's construction involved over 6,000 workers, including many artisans who contributed to its artistic details, utilizing granite sourced from nearby quarries.\nVisitors often admire not only the external grandeur but also the historical significance of the structure, as it stands as a testament to the political evolution of Karnataka. The adjacent Attara Kacheri, which houses the Karnataka High Court, complements the architectural ensemble of this area, showcasing a blend of Gothic and Indo-Saracenic styles"

              "reviewText": "Victoria Hospital is one of the oldest and famous government sector hospital that comes under BMCRI. BMCRI is the epicenter to cure every disease at a very minimal price.\n\nHere the service is very price friendly and the facilities here are very good if you know someone in the hospital itself means it's a cake walk for you. Yes, the services provided here are hard to get outside at this price which is the reason it is usually full of people.\nIt is very crowded all the time.\n\nAs you are seeking for the consultation:\n1. Go straight to OPD ( Out Patient Department). The first thing you need to do is to get an OPD card/book without this card or book you cannot do anything in this hospital. There is a particular section at the right corner of the entrance where you can be only rece registration book from OPD.\nTo get Take the OPD card  you need the patient Aadhar card with you alongside some cash to register and get a registration booklet.\n\nHere everything is free for checkup I was there for my mother hernia operation where I was directed to general surgeon and after that he told me to make a file again to make a file\n\nWe need to come to ground floor of OPD and at begining there will be a counter for this here you need OPD card and aadhar and some cash to make the file after that for operation they will shift you to the next building i.e Trauma and emergency care\n\nFor the free check up like blood xray etc etc you need to visit Room 2nd floor  201 A (Trauma Buliding) to make a Ayushman Bharat / arogya karnataka approval for this you need to have a ration card with aadhar and a photo of the patient with the doctor. Once you get the approval then everything will be free. After that you need to visit the doctor and list down the test needed and in entrance there will be a reception which is too crowded there you have to get the slips for the particular tests once everything is done\n\n1.Blood Test : you need to bring the sample test tube From the first floor and the respective doctor will collect the sample and need to submit to the blood testing department it may take 1-2 hrs for the blood report\n\n2. X Ray : It will be done in 1 St floor it's self where it will be too crowded and need to wait for 1-2 hrs for this report also\n\n3. ECG : It will be done in the ground floor emergency sector itself\n\nThe hospital here is very well maintained it like a private hospital very clean and very well specialised with modern equipment and good doctors\n\nMost of the doctors are students who will be treated in a good manner and very well behaved.\n\nBut here the major draw backs are the cleaning department people and the nursing staff these peoples are hectic who keeps on asking money like anything minimum amount should be 100-500 they will do there work but we have to pay like a bribe to them they will demand for the money like they own the Hospital.\nIf you give them money means they will treat you like God or else they will treat you like dog where they will show this grudge on patient while you are not there.\nThe staff attitude is like they are doctor with double degree.\nThere are the reason for the 3 star\nEvery hospital is located one beside the other namely\nMinto\nTrauma and emergency care\nVani villas etc\n\nBut the Victoria hospital main building is one of the worst buildings compared to Trauma the beds and ward are old and their staff are the worst where their attitude and asking for money is one the main roles for them.\n\nDuring the discharge you need to again visit the 201 A ayushman/arogya karnataka approval with the previous approved documents and the file form the doctor and the photo of the patient with the doctor and the operated area photo(wound). Once the approval is done you're good to go with the discharge procedure.\n\nThe one thing is for sure If you have good money and influence this the place where everything will happen smoothly and quickly"

Many of them speak rudely, show no empathy towards patients or their families, and often behave in an unhelpful manner. Even in critical situations, there appears to be a shocking lack of urgency and concern for the well-being of patients.\nOne particularly upsetting experience involved the staff at the admission counter. The lady there was extremely disrespectful, speaking rudely even to senior citizens. Additionally, the hospital lacks basic modern facilities such as digital payment options, forcing people to rely solely on cash—even in emergencies.\nPatients who are already in distress are made to run from one room to another, instead of being provided with immediate care. This lack of coordination and compassion is unacceptable.\nI urge the concerned authorities and the hospital management to take immediate steps to improve the behavior and professionalism of the staff. Basic training in communication, empathy, and patient care is urgently needed. Staff members must learn to speak politely, treat people with respect, and keep their tone calm and composed.\nThe current state of affairs is deeply concerning, and I hope this issue is taken seriously before more lives are impacted due to negligence and lack of proper conduct."

He also suggested a physiotherapy treatment , which was right next door. The physiotherapist was too good. She too did what was needed.\nParking is a problem though. Also keep in mind that this is a govt hospital. There is going to be long queues and huge waiting time in some cases. Kindly keep that in mind. They are trying to provide the best of the services they can."
