Based on the story, there were few other temples that were built however those  are in the sea now and this is the only one that is still visible.\n\nThe temple area is big and is well maintained. It is clean and there were few security guys monitoring the temple. During my visit , the temple is closed, but we still can reach the front of the temple  but it is not allowed to enter the temple.\n\nThe only challenging part is parking. it is hard to find a parking space. Also the traffic to the temple is quite heavy. It is worth visiting the temple."

There are 2 parking near by one is paid and other one is free. Pay parking is around 95 rs with that you can drive car and can go close to the sea."

The temple has a really special feel to it, standing right by the coast. What really stood out to me was the architecture – it's quite remarkable and definitely the highlight of the visit. You can spend a good amount of time just admiring the intricate carvings and the overall structure, imagining the history behind it.\nBased on my experience, I'd strongly suggest planning your visit during the daytime. The sunlight truly brings out the details in the stonework and allows you to appreciate the craftsmanship fully. Seeing it illuminated by natural light makes a significant difference compared to dimmer conditions. It's a fascinating piece of history, and seeing the architectural details clearly is key to the experience. Definitely a worthwhile stop if you appreciate historical sites and impressive architecture!"

The stone carvings and the overall setting make it a must visit for anyone interested in history and culture.\n\nHowever, there are a few practical concerns for visitors: professional cameras are not allowed inside, and unfortunately, there is no locker facility to keep your belongings safe. Kindhearted security guards may suggest leaving items in their office on a goodwill, but that’s not advisable for own sake. It’s best to travel light when visiting. Also, tickets can be booked online in advance in discounted price, which saves time and avoids hassle at the counter.\n\nA magnificent site, but experience can be smoother by Archaeological Department."

Basic infrastructures like clean toilets, drinking water, shaded areas to sit, stone paved walking path, signage, security, well maintained grass, etc are definitely worth mentioning.\n\nA lot of people visit here and its very crowded in the parking area and just outside the ticket area but after entering, it's very comfortable crowd. I would recommend visiting hear outside of direct noon sunlight because it will be extremely hot in the noon ( please refer to visiting time ).\n\nDuring our visit, most of the actual temple area in the immediate vicinity had renovation/maintenance going on. But nothing that would hinder  usual exploration and photography.\n\nAll area inside the outer fencing and beach boundary is well maintained and clean."

              "reviewText": "A Memorable Trip to Mahabalipuram Beach\n\nLast October, I had the most unforgettable trip with my parents to Mahabalipuram Beach in Tamil Nadu. It was truly one of the best experiences of my life. The scenic beauty of the beach, with its golden sand and calming waves, immediately put us in a peaceful mood. The weather was perfect, and the sea breeze added to the charm of the place.\n\nWe started our day by exploring the ancient shore temple, which stands as a magnificent reminder of India's rich cultural heritage. The intricate carvings and the sound of the ocean nearby made it a magical experience. We also visited the Five Rathas and Arjuna’s Penance, which left us amazed by the craftsmanship of ancient times.\n\nSpending time on the beach with my parents was the most special part. We took long walks, collected seashells, and clicked lots of pictures. Watching the sunset together was a highlight — the sky turned shades of orange and pink, and it felt like a dream.\n\nThe local food was delicious, especially the fresh seafood served in the beachside stalls. We also shopped for handmade souvenirs and shell crafts, which added a personal touch to our trip.\n\nThis trip brought us even closer as a family. Mahabalipuram gave us not just beautiful memories but also a deep sense of joy and togetherness. I highly recommend visiting this lovely place — it’s perfect for families and those looking for peace, history, and natural beauty all in one."

The beach is less crowded than Chennai’s city beaches, making it perfect for a relaxing walk or enjoying the sea breeze.\nThe nearby rock-cut temples and monuments add a historical charm to the place. Watching the sunrise here is a magical experience, and the waves are great for photography. While swimming isn't recommended due to strong currents, the beach is ideal for unwinding and enjoying local seafood."

It’s one of those places where history whispers through stone, and every structure tells a story carved centuries ago.\n\nA Glimpse into the Past\n\nThe Pancha Rathas, also known as the Five Rathas, are monolithic rock temples carved in the 7th century during the reign of the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I. What amazed me most was that each ratha (chariot) is carved from a single granite stone—yes, a single giant rock! They are named after the Pandavas and Draupadi from the Mahabharata, though interestingly, they have no actual connection to the characters. These structures were more like architectural experiments by the Pallavas, laying the foundation for later Dravidian temple designs.\n\nBeauty Carved in Stone\n\nEach ratha has its own distinct style and charm. Dharmaraja Ratha is the tallest and most ornate, while Draupadi Ratha, though small, is beautifully carved like a thatched hut. The Bhima Ratha stood out with its long hall-like structure. Life-sized sculptures of animals like lions and a majestic elephant add a mythical vibe to the site. The whole area has a serene, ancient energy—perfect for soaking in history while admiring fine craftsmanship.\n\nGetting There\n\nReaching Pancha Rathas is quite easy. I took a short drive from Chennai, which is about 60 km away. The roads are good, and the scenic drive along the East Coast Road (ECR) makes the journey enjoyable. If you prefer public transport, buses and taxis are readily available from Chennai and nearby towns like Chengalpattu.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nI visited in the early morning, which was perfect. The weather was pleasant, the crowd was thin, and the golden light added an extra glow to the stone carvings. The best time to visit Mahabalipuram is between November and February when the climate is cooler and ideal for sightseeing. Try to avoid the peak afternoon sun—these rocks can get pretty hot!\n\nFinal Thoughts\nPancha Rathas is more than just an archaeological site—it’s a silent storyteller of India’s rich heritage. Standing amidst these 1,300-year-old marvels made me feel deeply connected to the past. If you love history, architecture, or just serene places with character, this should be high on your list.\n\nPro tip: Don’t forget to carry water, wear a hat, and take your time exploring each ratha—it’s worth it."

It turned out to be one of the best and most memorable trips we’ve had as a family.\n\nAs we entered the site, we were immediately captivated by the incredible rock-cut structures. The Pancha Rathas, also known as the Five Rathas, are monolithic temples carved from a single granite rock — each one dedicated to a Pandava from the Mahabharata. The detailing, the size, and the symmetry of the architecture left us spellbound.\n\nWalking among these majestic structures, we felt like we had stepped back in time. My parents were fascinated by the history and the stories associated with each ratha. We spent hours admiring the carvings, taking photos, and learning about the Pallava dynasty’s craftsmanship.\n\nThe peaceful environment, gentle breeze, and natural surroundings made the visit even more enjoyable. We laughed, explored, and shared snacks under the shade of trees — simple moments that made the day truly special.\n\nThis trip was not just about seeing a historical monument; it was about creating lasting memories with my parents. The beauty, history, and serenity of Pancha Rathas brought us closer together and gave us a deeper appreciation for India’s rich cultural heritage.\n\nI would highly recommend visiting Pancha Rathas to anyone who loves history, art, and spending meaningful time with family."

I remember walking up the rocky path under the warm sun, and the moment I saw that giant boulder perfectly balanced on a slope, I was speechless — how could something so big just stand there, untouched for centuries? 😮🙏 I sat beneath it with my cousins, half nervous it might roll, half amazed by its calm presence. We laughed, clicked funny pictures pretending to hold it up, and shared stories under its shadow 📸😂. It wasn’t just a tourist spot — it felt like a moment of connection with nature, history, and my loved ones. A simple rock, but a memory that will stay in my heart forever 💖🌞."

This unique and mysterious giant rock, balanced on a slope, left us all amazed and full of wonder.\n\nThe atmosphere was vibrant and filled with the laughter of tourists, children running around, and families capturing memories. We were fascinated by how this massive boulder, weighing over 250 tons, has remained unmoved for centuries — almost defying gravity! Standing beside it, we couldn’t stop admiring nature’s miracle and the historical charm surrounding it.\n\nExploring the area was both fun and relaxing. We climbed nearby rocks, took dozens of photos, and enjoyed the scenic views all around. The weather was pleasant, and the cool breeze made the entire experience even more refreshing. My parents, too, were thrilled and kept talking about the uniqueness of the place.\n\nOne of the highlights was simply sitting on the grass, enjoying some local snacks, and soaking in the peaceful surroundings. The trip wasn’t just about sightseeing, but also about bonding, laughter, and quality time together.\n\nKrishna’s Butterball, with its playful name and incredible presence, gave us memories that we will always treasure. Visiting this spot made us feel connected to both nature and history. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a light-hearted yet awe-inspiring travel experience with family."

This massive granite boulder, precariously perched on a slope, is a testament to the incredible laws of physics.\n\nAs I watched, awestruck, I couldn't help but wonder how this massive rock had defied gravity for centuries. The sheer magnitude of the boulder, combined with its seemingly impossible balance, left me speechless.\n\nWhat struck me most, however, was the diverse crowd of visitors from all over India and the world. People of all ages, cultures, and backgrounds had gathered to marvel at this natural wonder. It was heartwarming to see strangers becoming fast friends, bonding over their shared wonder.\n\nKrishna's Butter Ball is truly a beautiful place that must be experienced.

Nestled in Mahabalipuram, this museum is a true treasure trove for anyone curious about the ocean and its wonders.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped inside, we were impressed by the sheer variety and detail in the seashell collection. It’s hard to believe such an extensive and beautifully curated museum exists in India! There are thousands of shells on display—from the tiniest micro-shells to large, rare, and intricately shaped marine specimens. Each section is thoughtfully laid out, with clear information and a lot of interesting facts, making the visit not just enjoyable but also educational.\n\nOur little daughter had a great time too! She was full of curiosity, crawling around happily and enjoying the colorful displays and the calm indoor atmosphere. The museum is clean, well-organized, and safe for families with small children.\n\nThey also have additional attractions like a small aquarium and a gift shop, where you can buy unique shell-based souvenirs. The staff were polite and helpful, and the entire place had a peaceful vibe that added to the charm of the visit.\n\nOverall, the India Seashell Museum is a wonderful destination for families, nature lovers, and anyone interested in marine life. It’s informative, peaceful, and quite unique—definitely worth including in your Mahabalipuram itinerary."

It stands out as one of the largest seashell museums in Asia, offering a unique experience for visitors interested in marine life and natural history. The museum complex also includes additional attractions like a Pearl Museum, Fishing Museum, and even a Dinosaur Park, making it a multi-theme destination suitable for families and children.\n\nEach section of the complex has a separate entry fee, though a combined entry ticket is available for approximately ₹800. While the pricing may feel a bit steep, the air-conditioned interiors and the shade make it a great mid-day stop, especially when the sun is at its peak. Planning your day to visit other Mahabalipuram landmarks in the morning or evening and this museum during the hotter hours is a smart move.\n\nThe exhibits are well-curated, and a visit of 1–2 hours is generally enough to explore the entire complex. Although the entry fee might seem expensive to some, the variety and uniqueness of the exhibits make it worth a visit for those interested in natural curiosities and marine collections."

About there are 3000 above sculptures are kept inside the museum but some valuable sculptures are kept without any care just under the open sky. Government should be responsible for preserving those ancient valuable sculptures. I think it's an inspiration for the students and also who like it.

It’s quite large, with enough room for someone to sit and look out over the nearby village and hills. At one end, there’s a carved lion that faces north. It dates back to the Pallava period in the seventh century, and while it carries a local tale linking it to Yuddhishtira from the Mahabharata, it’s believed to be a royal seat carved for a king who would pause and survey the land.\n\nReaching the throne only takes a short climb. Climbing up, you sense how naturally the craftsmen shaped it right into the rock, using both myth and landscape in their work. When seated, the breeze around you feels freeing, and the view spreads out below in a calming, almost meditative way.\n\nMost visitors spend around thirty minutes here. It’s a quiet spot showing how art, history, and nature blend together. It doesn’t feel like a tourist trap but more like a gentle reminder of how life and power used to connect with these lands and legends."

              "reviewText": "​The Mahishasuramardini Cave at Mahabalipuram, a UNESCO World Heritage site, stands as a prime example of Pallava dynasty rock-cut architecture.  Dated to the 7th century CE, this cave temple is a testament to the artistic and engineering prowess of the Pallava kings, particularly King Mahendravarman I or his son, Narasimhavarman I. Carved from a single large rock, its simple yet elegant facade features a pillared porch and three cells, or shrines, at the rear. The pillars are slender and fluted, a distinctive feature of early Pallava architecture. The cave's design beautifully integrates a natural rock formation with intricate sculptural work, creating a sacred space that feels both monumental and intimate.\n\n​The cave's interior is renowned for its magnificent bas-relief panels, which are the focal point of the temple's artistic expression. The northern wall features a stunning panel depicting the slumber of Vishnu, known as Anantashayana. In this serene scene, Lord Vishnu is shown reclining on the cosmic serpent Adishesha, surrounded by various divine and human figures. The composition is calm and harmonious, with a sense of cosmic tranquility that contrasts sharply with the dynamic scene on the opposite wall.\n​On the southern wall, the cave's namesake, the Mahishasuramardini panel, comes to life with incredible energy and detail. This dynamic sculpture depicts the goddess Durga engaged in a fierce battle with the buffalo-headed demon Mahishasura. Durga is shown in a triumphant pose, mounted on her lion and wielding a bow, while her adversaries are in a state of chaotic defeat. The scene is full of movement, tension, and power, with figures frozen in mid-action. This panel is considered a masterpiece of Indian art, capturing the emotional intensity and drama of the mythological narrative.\n​The Mahishasuramardini Cave, while seemingly simple in its architectural form, is a profound cultural and religious artifact. It not only represents a significant phase in the development of rock-cut temples in Southern India but also serves as a powerful medium for storytelling through stone. The contrasting panels of Vishnu's slumber and Durga's battle encapsulate the duality of divine power the tranquil and the fierce.

Shaped like a stone chariot, it shares architectural similarities with the famous Pancha Rathas. The temple’s facade features rows of sturdy stone pillars with lion-shaped bases, each hand carved directly into the granite. These pillars support a gracefully curved roof resembling a thatched hut in stone, a hallmark of early Dravidian architecture.\n\nEvery detail from the miniature shrine motifs carved along the cornice to the precise geometric alignment of the columns showcases the Pallava artisans’ skill. The sanctum once enshrined Lord Shiva but now houses an image of Lord Ganesha, attracting both devotees and tourists. The stone surface bears the natural grain and texture of the granite, weathered by centuries but still remarkably intact.\n\nSet against the open sky, with no added plaster or paint, Ganesh Ratha stands as a pure, unadorned masterpiece of rock cut art, a must-visit for anyone exploring Mahabalipuram’s UNESCO World Heritage monuments."

              "reviewText": "This rock-cut temple in Mahabalipuram is a marvel of ancient craftsmanship. Carefully carved from a single block of pink granite, it stands fully completed—unlike several nearby unfinished chariots. The temple is a part of a group of stone \"rathas\" built by a South Indian dynasty, carved during the late seventh century by kings like Mahendravarman I and Narasimhavarman I  .\n\nOriginally, the shrine was dedicated to Shiva and housed a Shiva Linga. In the late 19th century local worshippers replaced it with an idol of Ganesha, giving the temple its current name  . Some historians believe this temple was the first of its kind at the site, inspired by an earlier wooden prototype  .\n\nArchitecturally it follows a classic South Indian temple design. It has a rectangular base and a two-tiered superstructure decorated with carved pilasters, niches, and roof motifs. Inside there is a small sanctum housing the Ganesha idol, with finely sculpted walls showing figures of Shiva, Vishnu, Durga and others  .\n\nThe surroundings feel calm and open. The temple sits near a hillside and close to a famous bas-relief carving of a mythological story. The area around it is neat, has walkways and some shade, making it a pleasant place to explore and reflect.\n\nA visit here usually takes about thirty to forty-five minutes, enough to admire the architecture, understand the history, and soak in the serene atmosphere  .\n\nThis shrine stands out because it was completed when nearby structures remained unfinished. It shows the early evolution of monolith rock-cut architecture of that era  .\n\nIf you are visiting Mahabalipuram, this temple is a must-stop. It offers a clear example of early temple design, history that connects two major dynastic rulers, and a peaceful spot amid the famous monument complex."

Nestled among ancient rock-cut wonders, the mandapam instantly transported us to a different era — a place where devotion, history, and art come together beautifully.\n\nAs we entered, my kids were amazed by the carvings on the stone walls — especially the magnificent scene of Lord Krishna lifting the Govardhan Hill. The expressions of the villagers and animals were carved with such emotion that even my younger one, who usually rushes through monuments, stood still in awe. We spent time explaining the story to them, making it a beautiful blend of mythology and learning.\n\nThe walls of the mandapam were filled with life-like sculptures that seemed to whisper tales from a time long gone. The craftsmanship was extraordinary — each figure was so detailed, from the folds of clothing to the serene faces of the devotees. We couldn’t stop clicking pictures, but at one point, we just put the cameras down and soaked in the peace of the place.\n\nWhat touched me the most was the timeless devotion that echoed through the carvings. It wasn’t just a monument; it felt like a living temple of stories and spirit. Visiting Krishna Mandapam with my family was a heartwarming experience, one we will always cherish."

Part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, this open-air hall showcases the architectural brilliance of the Pallava period. The structure is supported by robust stone pillars, many adorned with yali (mythical lion) motifs, adding both grace and strength to the monument.\n\nInside, the highlight is the grand bas-relief depicting Lord Krishna lifting the Govardhan Hill to protect the villagers and cattle from torrential rains. This sculptural narration is full of life and movement, with figures of men, women, children, and animals carved in remarkable detail. Each expression feels so natural and vivid that it transcends time.\n\nThe steps leading up to the mandapam, the cool stone underfoot, and the soft light filtering in through the open façade create a serene and contemplative atmosphere. The craftsmanship speaks volumes about the cultural and devotional depth of its creators. Standing there, surrounded by centuries-old artistry, I felt transported to another era—a place where devotion, skill, and storytelling unite seamlessly. Truly, Krishna Mandapam is not just a monument; it is a living chapter of history."

There are three shrines dedicated to Brahma, Siva and Vishnu. The shrine of Siva is slightly larger than the others. There is pair of dvarapalas guarding the entrance of each shrine, one on either side. Over the entrance depicted are hara elements, the ones usually occurring on the talas of structural temples. The northern most cell dedicated to Subrahmanya in the form of Brahmasasta, the central standing Siva and the northernmost to Vishnu. Further, north of these shrines is a niche dedicated to Durga.\""

Carved out of a single rock, this shrine exemplifies the craftsmanship and artistic prowess of the Pallava artisans.\n\nThe shrine comprises three chambers, each housing a sanctum, and is dedicated to various deities. The central sanctum features a lingam, symbolizing Lord Shiva. The other chambers likely housed idols of different gods, though some remain empty today. The exterior of the shrine is adorned with intricate carvings, including mythical figures, divine beings, and ornate detailing that reflects the aesthetic sensibilities of the Pallava period.\n\nThe Triple-Celled Rock-Cut Shrine stands as a testament to the religious and cultural vibrancy of Mahabalipuram during ancient times. The simplicity and elegance of its design, combined with the precision of the rock-cutting techniques, contribute to its significance as an archaeological and historical gem in this UNESCO World Heritage Site. Visitors are captivated by the spiritual ambiance and the rich cultural heritage embodied in this remarkable rock-cut shrine."

It’s best to visit early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat and crowds.\n\nGreat for history lovers, photographers, and anyone who wants to experience India’s ancient art and architecture up close.

This ancient carving, dating back to the Pallava dynasty (7th-8th century CE), showcases the exceptional artistry of that era.\n\nSituated close to the Arjuna’s Penance relief and other UNESCO-listed monuments, the rock is a significant part of Mahabalipuram’s rich heritage. Visitors can admire the intricate details of the battle scene, reflecting the power of Shakti (Divine Feminine Energy) in Hindu mythology.\n\nEasily accessible via East Coast Road (ECR), Mahabalipuram is about 58 km from Chennai and can be reached by bus, taxi, or private vehicle. The site offers a blend of history, mythology, and scenic beachside beauty, making it a must-visit for history lovers, photographers, and spiritual seekers exploring the region."

You are allowed to stay on the top for a very few minutes only as its a queue to get to top one after the other. 10 people at a time allowed to stay on top. And they have to come step down from the top for others to get up. Attaching an image of rules written down there.\n\nIts a one way up & down. The spiral stairs is very thin, so you are expected to give way / squish through  on your way up and down. And obviously, if you are claustrophobic, afraid of heights or have difficulty with steep thin stairs, would not recommend climbing there. Some people do feel they can climb up then get scared half-way and then go back down (which is quite normal, nothing wrong with that). I did enjoy it.I assume you can stay longer if you visit on a less crowded day or time. Apart from that, its a nice view."

But climbing the staircase to reach the top of the lighthouse feels a bit risky, have to be extra cautious during the climb esp the last few stairs. On top of it, the guards are very rude. Nobody tells you the exit time while buying the ticket and with just 10 mins on the clock the guards arrive and pressure you to get down and leave the park so that they can go home on time. Need better people management skills."

              "reviewText": "\"I recently visited the historic Mahabalipuram Lighthouse, and I must say, it was an exhilarating experience! As I began to climb the narrow stairs, I couldn't help but feel a little scared. The stairs were steep and winding, with barely enough space for one person to pass.\n\nHowever, the breathtaking views from the top made every step worth it. As I reached the top, I was greeted by a stunning panorama of the surrounding landscape. The vast expanse of the Bay of Bengal stretched out before me, with the sun shining brightly overhead.\n\nWhat struck me most was the sheer number of tourists who had made the climb. Despite the narrow stairs, people of all ages and nationalities were eager to experience the thrill of climbing the lighthouse.\n\nAt just ₹10 for the ticket, it's an absolute steal. However, I would caution visitors to be extremely careful while climbing the stairs. The narrow space can be daunting, and it's essential to take your time and watch your step.\n\nOverall, the Mahabalipuram Lighthouse is a must-visit destination for anyone looking for a thrilling adventure.\n\nRating: 5/5 stars\""

Mind the narrow steps, especially when with elderly and with kids.\n\nOne can walk to the backside of the temple on the flat rock-top to get a 360 view, but be cautious as there are no handrails and no guardrails.\n\nScan the QR code image (attached with this review) to get a audio tour of temple.\n\nBe advised that the weekend crowd can be a little tricky to wade throw. Prefer morning hours or weekdays.\n\nExcept for Dec-Jan months, the Sun is quite hot so be prepared to sweat it out a bit. Carry water or electrolyte solution with you. Carry some basic food as well, especially when with kids. There are hawkers selling small fare, typically fruits and buttermilk. Great combo to beat the heat and that too at a reasonable price.\n\nA large, free, public parking ground is just across the road but it is a 200 m walk. The temple and nearby monuments are not accessible for people who have mobility issues."

It is the smallest of the famous Pancha Rathas, yet it stands out for the intricate details covering its walls.\n\nEvery inch of the exterior showcases masterfully carved sculptures depicting figures from Hindu mythology, including Durga standing on a lotus with her devotees flanking her. The walls feature graceful female figures, ornate pillars, and symbolic motifs — all crafted with remarkable precision despite being over thirteen centuries old.\n\nThis monument, along with the other rathas, was commissioned during the reign of King Narasimhavarman I in the 7th century and later buried under sand for centuries. It was rediscovered during the colonial period and has since been re-explored and preserved as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site at Mahabalipuram.\n\nVisiting this site offers not just a visual treat but also a deep connection to the artistry, spirituality, and engineering genius of ancient India. Its compact yet rich design makes it a photographer’s delight and a historian’s treasure — an unmissable stop for anyone exploring Tamil Nadu’s heritage trail."

Although, these temples, abode or shrines ( it is unclear) are named after the Pandavas, they seem to be temples of deities more than Pandavas. In fact the Draupadi chariot has an idle that closely resembles Goddess Durga. If you are an information buff unlike me, availing the services of a trained guide is recommended. Nonetheless,  go to 5 rathas with atleast 1-2 hours, so can appreciate the sculptures, cornice, the niches carved and the vision. By the way all the temples are carved out of 1 big solid rock. So technically the 5 rathas are a monolith.\nWeather advisory- This place is devoid of shady trees, so to better enjoy this place, do carry an umbrella to protect from the Sun beating down upon you."

It was later modified by Archeological survey of india.\nThe whole area was build by Pallava dynasty about 700 AD. This patiticular area has 5 temples . Only first one of temples ( Durga temple) has idol. All rest 4 of indra, brahma, shiva  bishnu has no idol. These idols were demolished.\nStory related to pandava of mahabharat was fake.\nStanding at this site, you will have a unique feeling of seeing structures build 1400 years ago.\nThese structures was made by working on a small mountain."

The central shrine once displayed a Somaskanda panel showing Shiva with his family, but most of those reliefs and idols were removed later during the Vijayanagara period  . A Sanskrit inscription on the floor praises Rudra, which remains visible even as many sculptures were removed  .\n\nDuring the Vijayanagara era, it was adapted for Ramanuja, the Vaishnava scholar. Some original Shaiva sculptures were chiselled away, and freestanding rough pillars were added in front of the cave  . Despite these changes, the site retains its sense of balance, with crisp stone surfaces, graceful pillars, and a calm hall leading to the three sanctums.\n\nVisiting takes about 30 to 45 minutes, enough time to study the architectural details, even if most carvings are gone. The space feels peaceful—shaded by the hillside, cool to the touch, and less crowded than the larger monuments nearby.\n\nThis mandapam stands out because of its elegance and historical journey—from a Shaiva cave temple to a Vaishnava shrine linked to Ramanuja. If you're exploring Mahabalipuram, this one is a quiet, thoughtful stop."

              "reviewText": "One of the most sophisticated and complete cave temples, Ramanuja mandapam had three cells. It was excavated in the center of the main Mamallapuram hill, on its eastern scarp. The temple was partially renovated centuries after its construction into a shrine for the Vaishnava scholar, Ramanuja. The later artisans added the six crudely-cut, free-standing pillars in front, probably to extend the mandapa.\n\nThe Ramanuja cave consists of a rectangular ardha-mandapa, marked with a row of pillars. At the side of its facade are two model vimanas with a square rock platform. Many traditional Hindu-temple architectural elements are found here. Inside, the main excavation begins with an adhishthana, a row of two pillars, two pilasters and three ankanas forming its facade. Behind it is an oblong mandapa with three square shrines. The side shrines were originally placed about two feet behind the central one, but all three shared a common raised base. The entrance to the shrines had dvarapalas, now largely missing. Like other Hindu temples, this was an open structure without evidence of jambs. The back wall of the central shrine has a five-foot-square panel which held a Somaskanda bas-relief, much of which has been erased. The ceilings of the three cells have plaster remnants and evidence that they may have been painted. The walls separating the three shrines were removed by later artisans.\n\nThe three cells were dedicated to Brahma, Shiva (the central cell) and Vishnu, or to three obscure forms of Shiva. The southern panel in the main mandapa probably contained Durga. None of the images have survived; only faint remnants are traceable, because most of the wall reliefs were chiselled off.[76] On the floor between the two pillars of the facade is a Sanskrit inscription in the Grantha alphabet praising Rudra, evidence that the temple was originally associated with Shaivism. The inscription's florid font and epithets date it to the 7th century and Parameshvara Varman."

Interesting features near the temple are steps cut in stone and leading up to the top of rock!\n\nFront of this “Three Celled” temple has six (not carved) columns covered with stone slabs. It encloses a quadrangular forecourt without roof (Probably, it existed earlier). The three cells were dedicated to Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu (?). From Pallavas to Vijayanagara Empire, none of the Shaiva images have survived; only faint remnants are traceable (most of the wall reliefs were chiselled off).\n\nHowever, between two pillars an inscription of Rudra is retained for unknown reasons – Approximately, it reads as: \"Six times cursed be those in whose hearts does not dwell “Rudra” (Siva), the saviour from the evil path (This inscription should be dated to the 7th century and Parameshvara Varman)\n\nIt is one of the Group of (40 Nos) Monuments at Mahabalipuram that were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and presently maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\n•\tINFO:  Few out of  “What to see in Mahabalipuram” are: Shore Temple, Tiger Cave, Sculpture museum, Pancha Ratha, Krishna’s Butter Ball, Descent of Ganges (& or Penance of Arjuna), Mahabalipuram Beach, Ganesha Ratha, Varaha Cave, Sthala Sayana Perumal Temple, Mahishamardini Mandapa, Mahabalipuram lighthouse, Draupadi Ratha, Arjun Chariot, Heritage Museum, Olakkannesvara Temple, Valayankuttai Ratha, Maritime Museum, Naval Museum, Symmetric Building, Mukunda Nayanar Temple, Yudhishthir Chariot, Karukathamman Temple, Raya Gopuram, Tiger Cave, Wall Carvings, Monkey Monk (Park), Pallava Beach, Many Sculpture Manufacturing places, Many Handicrafts Shops, Etc."

During this Vaishnava resurgence, figures adorning the walls of this Ramanuja cave temple were chiselled off, the arrangement of cells at the back wall was altered, and a mandapa was added in front of the cave. The Somaskanda panel was proven to be an iconic representation of the Pallava period, which chiselled entirely because of this invasion."

It is clean and there were few security guys monitoring the temple. During my visit , the temple is closed, but we still can reach the front of the temple  but it is not allowed to enter the temple.\n\nThe only challenging part is parking. it is hard to find a parking space. Also the traffic to the temple is quite heavy. It is worth visiting the temple."

The temple has a really special feel to it, standing right by the coast. What really stood out to me was the architecture – it's quite remarkable and definitely the highlight of the visit. You can spend a good amount of time just admiring the intricate carvings and the overall structure, imagining the history behind it.\nBased on my experience, I'd strongly suggest planning your visit during the daytime. The sunlight truly brings out the details in the stonework and allows you to appreciate the craftsmanship fully. Seeing it illuminated by natural light makes a significant difference compared to dimmer conditions. It's a fascinating piece of history, and seeing the architectural details clearly is key to the experience. Definitely a worthwhile stop if you appreciate historical sites and impressive architecture!"

Kindhearted security guards may suggest leaving items in their office on a goodwill, but that’s not advisable for own sake. It’s best to travel light when visiting. Also, tickets can be booked online in advance in discounted price, which saves time and avoids hassle at the counter.\n\nA magnificent site, but experience can be smoother by Archaeological Department."

I would recommend visiting hear outside of direct noon sunlight because it will be extremely hot in the noon ( please refer to visiting time ).\n\nDuring our visit, most of the actual temple area in the immediate vicinity had renovation/maintenance going on. But nothing that would hinder  usual exploration and photography.\n\nAll area inside the outer fencing and beach boundary is well maintained and clean."

              "reviewText": "During my recent trip to Mahabalipuram, one of the highlights was visiting the Pancha Rathas—an awe-inspiring group of rock-cut temples that left me speechless. It’s one of those places where history whispers through stone, and every structure tells a story carved centuries ago.\n\nA Glimpse into the Past\n\nThe Pancha Rathas, also known as the Five Rathas, are monolithic rock temples carved in the 7th century during the reign of the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I. What amazed me most was that each ratha (chariot) is carved from a single granite stone—yes, a single giant rock! They are named after the Pandavas and Draupadi from the Mahabharata, though interestingly, they have no actual connection to the characters. These structures were more like architectural experiments by the Pallavas, laying the foundation for later Dravidian temple designs.\n\nBeauty Carved in Stone\n\nEach ratha has its own distinct style and charm. Dharmaraja Ratha is the tallest and most ornate, while Draupadi Ratha, though small, is beautifully carved like a thatched hut. The Bhima Ratha stood out with its long hall-like structure. Life-sized sculptures of animals like lions and a majestic elephant add a mythical vibe to the site. The whole area has a serene, ancient energy—perfect for soaking in history while admiring fine craftsmanship.\n\nGetting There\n\nReaching Pancha Rathas is quite easy. I took a short drive from Chennai, which is about 60 km away. The roads are good, and the scenic drive along the East Coast Road (ECR) makes the journey enjoyable. If you prefer public transport, buses and taxis are readily available from Chennai and nearby towns like Chengalpattu.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nI visited in the early morning, which was perfect. The weather was pleasant, the crowd was thin, and the golden light added an extra glow to the stone carvings. The best time to visit Mahabalipuram is between November and February when the climate is cooler and ideal for sightseeing. Try to avoid the peak afternoon sun—these rocks can get pretty hot!\n\nFinal Thoughts\nPancha Rathas is more than just an archaeological site—it’s a silent storyteller of India’s rich heritage. Standing amidst these 1,300-year-old marvels made me feel deeply connected to the past. If you love history, architecture, or just serene places with character, this should be high on your list.\n\nPro tip: Don’t forget to carry water, wear a hat, and take your time exploring each ratha—it’s worth it."

It turned out to be one of the best and most memorable trips we’ve had as a family.\n\nAs we entered the site, we were immediately captivated by the incredible rock-cut structures. The Pancha Rathas, also known as the Five Rathas, are monolithic temples carved from a single granite rock — each one dedicated to a Pandava from the Mahabharata. The detailing, the size, and the symmetry of the architecture left us spellbound.\n\nWalking among these majestic structures, we felt like we had stepped back in time. My parents were fascinated by the history and the stories associated with each ratha. We spent hours admiring the carvings, taking photos, and learning about the Pallava dynasty’s craftsmanship.\n\nThe peaceful environment, gentle breeze, and natural surroundings made the visit even more enjoyable. We laughed, explored, and shared snacks under the shade of trees — simple moments that made the day truly special.\n\nThis trip was not just about seeing a historical monument; it was about creating lasting memories with my parents. The beauty, history, and serenity of Pancha Rathas brought us closer together and gave us a deeper appreciation for India’s rich cultural heritage.\n\nI would highly recommend visiting Pancha Rathas to anyone who loves history, art, and spending meaningful time with family."

I remember walking up the rocky path under the warm sun, and the moment I saw that giant boulder perfectly balanced on a slope, I was speechless — how could something so big just stand there, untouched for centuries? 😮🙏 I sat beneath it with my cousins, half nervous it might roll, half amazed by its calm presence. We laughed, clicked funny pictures pretending to hold it up, and shared stories under its shadow 📸😂. It wasn’t just a tourist spot — it felt like a moment of connection with nature, history, and my loved ones. A simple rock, but a memory that will stay in my heart forever 💖🌞."

This unique and mysterious giant rock, balanced on a slope, left us all amazed and full of wonder.\n\nThe atmosphere was vibrant and filled with the laughter of tourists, children running around, and families capturing memories. We were fascinated by how this massive boulder, weighing over 250 tons, has remained unmoved for centuries — almost defying gravity! Standing beside it, we couldn’t stop admiring nature’s miracle and the historical charm surrounding it.\n\nExploring the area was both fun and relaxing. We climbed nearby rocks, took dozens of photos, and enjoyed the scenic views all around. The weather was pleasant, and the cool breeze made the entire experience even more refreshing. My parents, too, were thrilled and kept talking about the uniqueness of the place.\n\nOne of the highlights was simply sitting on the grass, enjoying some local snacks, and soaking in the peaceful surroundings. The trip wasn’t just about sightseeing, but also about bonding, laughter, and quality time together.\n\nKrishna’s Butterball, with its playful name and incredible presence, gave us memories that we will always treasure. Visiting this spot made us feel connected to both nature and history. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a light-hearted yet awe-inspiring travel experience with family."

The carvings are detailed and showcase the skill of Pallava artisans. The site also includes other mythological reliefs like Trivikrama and Gajalakshmi.\n\nWhile the site itself is not very large and can be explored in 10–15 minutes, it’s worth a stop if you’re visiting nearby attractions like Arjuna’s Penance or the Mahishasuramardini Cave. It gives a good glimpse into early South Indian rock-cut architecture."

Mind the narrow steps, especially when with elderly and with kids.\n\nOne can walk to the backside of the temple on the flat rock-top to get a 360 view, but be cautious as there are no handrails and no guardrails.\n\nScan the QR code image (attached with this review) to get a audio tour of temple.\n\nBe advised that the weekend crowd can be a little tricky to wade throw. Prefer morning hours or weekdays.\n\nExcept for Dec-Jan months, the Sun is quite hot so be prepared to sweat it out a bit. Carry water or electrolyte solution with you. Carry some basic food as well, especially when with kids. There are hawkers selling small fare, typically fruits and buttermilk. Great combo to beat the heat and that too at a reasonable price.\n\nA large, free, public parking ground is just across the road but it is a 200 m walk. The temple and nearby monuments are not accessible for people who have mobility issues."

Shaped like a stone chariot, it shares architectural similarities with the famous Pancha Rathas. The temple’s facade features rows of sturdy stone pillars with lion-shaped bases, each hand carved directly into the granite. These pillars support a gracefully curved roof resembling a thatched hut in stone, a hallmark of early Dravidian architecture.\n\nEvery detail from the miniature shrine motifs carved along the cornice to the precise geometric alignment of the columns showcases the Pallava artisans’ skill. The sanctum once enshrined Lord Shiva but now houses an image of Lord Ganesha, attracting both devotees and tourists. The stone surface bears the natural grain and texture of the granite, weathered by centuries but still remarkably intact.\n\nSet against the open sky, with no added plaster or paint, Ganesh Ratha stands as a pure, unadorned masterpiece of rock cut art, a must-visit for anyone exploring Mahabalipuram’s UNESCO World Heritage monuments."

              "reviewText": "This rock-cut temple in Mahabalipuram is a marvel of ancient craftsmanship. Carefully carved from a single block of pink granite, it stands fully completed—unlike several nearby unfinished chariots. The temple is a part of a group of stone \"rathas\" built by a South Indian dynasty, carved during the late seventh century by kings like Mahendravarman I and Narasimhavarman I  .\n\nOriginally, the shrine was dedicated to Shiva and housed a Shiva Linga. In the late 19th century local worshippers replaced it with an idol of Ganesha, giving the temple its current name  . Some historians believe this temple was the first of its kind at the site, inspired by an earlier wooden prototype  .\n\nArchitecturally it follows a classic South Indian temple design. It has a rectangular base and a two-tiered superstructure decorated with carved pilasters, niches, and roof motifs. Inside there is a small sanctum housing the Ganesha idol, with finely sculpted walls showing figures of Shiva, Vishnu, Durga and others  .\n\nThe surroundings feel calm and open. The temple sits near a hillside and close to a famous bas-relief carving of a mythological story. The area around it is neat, has walkways and some shade, making it a pleasant place to explore and reflect.\n\nA visit here usually takes about thirty to forty-five minutes, enough to admire the architecture, understand the history, and soak in the serene atmosphere  .\n\nThis shrine stands out because it was completed when nearby structures remained unfinished. It shows the early evolution of monolith rock-cut architecture of that era  .\n\nIf you are visiting Mahabalipuram, this temple is a must-stop. It offers a clear example of early temple design, history that connects two major dynastic rulers, and a peaceful spot amid the famous monument complex."

Nestled among ancient rock-cut wonders, the mandapam instantly transported us to a different era — a place where devotion, history, and art come together beautifully.\n\nAs we entered, my kids were amazed by the carvings on the stone walls — especially the magnificent scene of Lord Krishna lifting the Govardhan Hill. The expressions of the villagers and animals were carved with such emotion that even my younger one, who usually rushes through monuments, stood still in awe. We spent time explaining the story to them, making it a beautiful blend of mythology and learning.\n\nThe walls of the mandapam were filled with life-like sculptures that seemed to whisper tales from a time long gone. The craftsmanship was extraordinary — each figure was so detailed, from the folds of clothing to the serene faces of the devotees. We couldn’t stop clicking pictures, but at one point, we just put the cameras down and soaked in the peace of the place.\n\nWhat touched me the most was the timeless devotion that echoed through the carvings. It wasn’t just a monument; it felt like a living temple of stories and spirit. Visiting Krishna Mandapam with my family was a heartwarming experience, one we will always cherish."

              "reviewText": "This rock-cut shrine beside the giant Ganges bas-relief was carved out of the living granite in the seventh century. It is dedicated to Lord Krishna and features a carved pavilion added later to protect the delicate sculptures.\n\nInside, there's an incredible bas-relief showing the story of Krishna lifting Mount Govardhan to protect villagers and cattle from rain sent by Indra. He is shown holding the mountain with ease, surrounded by cows, gopis, shepherds, children and villagers—all carved in vivid detail. Every little scene with a milkmaid carrying pots or a woodcutter at work feels alive and gives a beautiful snapshot of that world.\n\nOriginally this was an open-air sculpture, but in the sixteenth century the pavilion with carved pillars was built to shield it. The mandapam is about 29 feet long and 12 feet high, with nine carved panels in total depicting moments from Krishna’s life and local village scenes.\n\nThis shrine shows the skills of Pallava artisans who pioneered rock-cut temple architecture. It reflects a shift from earlier ratha-style monuments to cave temples using carved granite. Their work laid the foundation for later temple styles in South India.\n\nThe space is peaceful to walk through. You can spend around 45 minutes admiring the carvings, studying the fine details, and imagining the stories they come from. The stone feels cool and the area is tidy. It is part of a larger collection of monuments and forms an important link in the evolution of Indian temple design.\n\nThis mandapam is special for its beautiful storytelling in stone, its connection to ancient myths, and its soft, reflective atmosphere in the heart of the monument complex."

Part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, this open-air hall showcases the architectural brilliance of the Pallava period. The structure is supported by robust stone pillars, many adorned with yali (mythical lion) motifs, adding both grace and strength to the monument.\n\nInside, the highlight is the grand bas-relief depicting Lord Krishna lifting the Govardhan Hill to protect the villagers and cattle from torrential rains. This sculptural narration is full of life and movement, with figures of men, women, children, and animals carved in remarkable detail. Each expression feels so natural and vivid that it transcends time.\n\nThe steps leading up to the mandapam, the cool stone underfoot, and the soft light filtering in through the open façade create a serene and contemplative atmosphere. The craftsmanship speaks volumes about the cultural and devotional depth of its creators. Standing there, surrounded by centuries-old artistry, I felt transported to another era—a place where devotion, skill, and storytelling unite seamlessly. Truly, Krishna Mandapam is not just a monument; it is a living chapter of history."

It’s quite large, with enough room for someone to sit and look out over the nearby village and hills. At one end, there’s a carved lion that faces north. It dates back to the Pallava period in the seventh century, and while it carries a local tale linking it to Yuddhishtira from the Mahabharata, it’s believed to be a royal seat carved for a king who would pause and survey the land.\n\nReaching the throne only takes a short climb. Climbing up, you sense how naturally the craftsmen shaped it right into the rock, using both myth and landscape in their work. When seated, the breeze around you feels freeing, and the view spreads out below in a calming, almost meditative way.\n\nMost visitors spend around thirty minutes here. It’s a quiet spot showing how art, history, and nature blend together. It doesn’t feel like a tourist trap but more like a gentle reminder of how life and power used to connect with these lands and legends."

              "reviewText": "​The Mahishasuramardini Cave at Mahabalipuram, a UNESCO World Heritage site, stands as a prime example of Pallava dynasty rock-cut architecture.  Dated to the 7th century CE, this cave temple is a testament to the artistic and engineering prowess of the Pallava kings, particularly King Mahendravarman I or his son, Narasimhavarman I. Carved from a single large rock, its simple yet elegant facade features a pillared porch and three cells, or shrines, at the rear. The pillars are slender and fluted, a distinctive feature of early Pallava architecture. The cave's design beautifully integrates a natural rock formation with intricate sculptural work, creating a sacred space that feels both monumental and intimate.\n\n​The cave's interior is renowned for its magnificent bas-relief panels, which are the focal point of the temple's artistic expression. The northern wall features a stunning panel depicting the slumber of Vishnu, known as Anantashayana. In this serene scene, Lord Vishnu is shown reclining on the cosmic serpent Adishesha, surrounded by various divine and human figures. The composition is calm and harmonious, with a sense of cosmic tranquility that contrasts sharply with the dynamic scene on the opposite wall.\n​On the southern wall, the cave's namesake, the Mahishasuramardini panel, comes to life with incredible energy and detail. This dynamic sculpture depicts the goddess Durga engaged in a fierce battle with the buffalo-headed demon Mahishasura. Durga is shown in a triumphant pose, mounted on her lion and wielding a bow, while her adversaries are in a state of chaotic defeat. The scene is full of movement, tension, and power, with figures frozen in mid-action. This panel is considered a masterpiece of Indian art, capturing the emotional intensity and drama of the mythological narrative.\n​The Mahishasuramardini Cave, while seemingly simple in its architectural form, is a profound cultural and religious artifact. It not only represents a significant phase in the development of rock-cut temples in Southern India but also serves as a powerful medium for storytelling through stone. The contrasting panels of Vishnu's slumber and Durga's battle encapsulate the duality of divine power the tranquil and the fierce. A visit to this cave is a journey back in time, allowing one to stand in awe of a bygone era's faith, artistic vision, and unwavering devotion, forever immortalized in the granite of Mahabalipuram."

Carved out of rocks, the temple depicts scenes from ancient Hindu epics, Puranas. The cave temple belongs to the 7th century, constructed under the Pallava dynasty (275 CE to 897 CE).

There are three shrines dedicated to Brahma, Siva and Vishnu. The shrine of Siva is slightly larger than the others. There is pair of dvarapalas guarding the entrance of each shrine, one on either side. Over the entrance depicted are hara elements, the ones usually occurring on the talas of structural temples. The northern most cell dedicated to Subrahmanya in the form of Brahmasasta, the central standing Siva and the northernmost to Vishnu. Further, north of these shrines is a niche dedicated to Durga.\""

Carved out of a single rock, this shrine exemplifies the craftsmanship and artistic prowess of the Pallava artisans.\n\nThe shrine comprises three chambers, each housing a sanctum, and is dedicated to various deities. The central sanctum features a lingam, symbolizing Lord Shiva. The other chambers likely housed idols of different gods, though some remain empty today. The exterior of the shrine is adorned with intricate carvings, including mythical figures, divine beings, and ornate detailing that reflects the aesthetic sensibilities of the Pallava period.\n\nThe Triple-Celled Rock-Cut Shrine stands as a testament to the religious and cultural vibrancy of Mahabalipuram during ancient times. The simplicity and elegance of its design, combined with the precision of the rock-cutting techniques, contribute to its significance as an archaeological and historical gem in this UNESCO World Heritage Site. Visitors are captivated by the spiritual ambiance and the rich cultural heritage embodied in this remarkable rock-cut shrine."

The sheer size and detail of the bas-relief are awe-inspiring. You can easily spend 30–45 minutes just admiring the stories etched into the rock — from gods and animals to sages and celestial beings.\n\nThe location is clean, walkable, and filled with other beautiful monuments nearby like the Krishna Butter Ball and the Shore Temple. It’s best to visit early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat and crowds.\n\nGreat for history lovers, photographers, and anyone who wants to experience India’s ancient art and architecture up close. Highly recommend stopping here if you’re in or around Mahabalipuram!"

Government should be responsible for preserving those ancient valuable sculptures. I think it's an inspiration for the students and also who like it.

You can observe the other monuments of Mahabalipuram, including the Mahabalipuram Lighthouse, shore temple, and more from this hilltop. There's an advantage that this place has over the Mahabalipuram lighthouse. That is that you need not pay a separate entry fee like the Mahabalipuram Lighthouse. And it is less crowded than the lighthouse. The altitude of this place is relatively lesser than the lighthouse. There are safety railings on the sides of the stairs leading to the top. There are other places of interest like Draupadi's bath, Raya Gopuram, and more near this place. It would be better if the management could add a few dustbins next to the hillock. It would better preserve the aesthetic value of the hillock by reducing the waste items disposed of improperly. Vendors usually sell spicy raw mango, chaat items, bottled drinking water, and so on in this place."

              "reviewText": "This cave mandapam carved into the hillside is one of the most finished examples of Pallava architecture from the seventh century. It runs about 24 feet long and eight feet deep, and the front porch feels almost complete, with octagonal pillars on stone lion bases and finials above them  .\n\nInside are three connected cells. The middle one was once dedicated to Shiva, and the two side chambers may have held Vishnu and Brahma. The central shrine once displayed a Somaskanda panel showing Shiva with his family, but most of those reliefs and idols were removed later during the Vijayanagara period  . A Sanskrit inscription on the floor praises Rudra, which remains visible even as many sculptures were removed  .\n\nDuring the Vijayanagara era, it was adapted for Ramanuja, the Vaishnava scholar. Some original Shaiva sculptures were chiselled away, and freestanding rough pillars were added in front of the cave  . Despite these changes, the site retains its sense of balance, with crisp stone surfaces, graceful pillars, and a calm hall leading to the three sanctums.\n\nVisiting takes about 30 to 45 minutes, enough time to study the architectural details, even if most carvings are gone. The space feels peaceful—shaded by the hillside, cool to the touch, and less crowded than the larger monuments nearby.\n\nThis mandapam stands out because of its elegance and historical journey—from a Shaiva cave temple to a Vaishnava shrine linked to Ramanuja. If you're exploring Mahabalipuram, this one is a quiet, thoughtful stop."

              "reviewText": "One of the most sophisticated and complete cave temples, Ramanuja mandapam had three cells. It was excavated in the center of the main Mamallapuram hill, on its eastern scarp. The temple was partially renovated centuries after its construction into a shrine for the Vaishnava scholar, Ramanuja. The later artisans added the six crudely-cut, free-standing pillars in front, probably to extend the mandapa.\n\nThe Ramanuja cave consists of a rectangular ardha-mandapa, marked with a row of pillars. At the side of its facade are two model vimanas with a square rock platform. Many traditional Hindu-temple architectural elements are found here. Inside, the main excavation begins with an adhishthana, a row of two pillars, two pilasters and three ankanas forming its facade. Behind it is an oblong mandapa with three square shrines. The side shrines were originally placed about two feet behind the central one, but all three shared a common raised base. The entrance to the shrines had dvarapalas, now largely missing. Like other Hindu temples, this was an open structure without evidence of jambs. The back wall of the central shrine has a five-foot-square panel which held a Somaskanda bas-relief, much of which has been erased. The ceilings of the three cells have plaster remnants and evidence that they may have been painted. The walls separating the three shrines were removed by later artisans.\n\nThe three cells were dedicated to Brahma, Shiva (the central cell) and Vishnu, or to three obscure forms of Shiva. The southern panel in the main mandapa probably contained Durga. None of the images have survived; only faint remnants are traceable, because most of the wall reliefs were chiselled off.[76] On the floor between the two pillars of the facade is a Sanskrit inscription in the Grantha alphabet praising Rudra, evidence that the temple was originally associated with Shaivism. The inscription's florid font and epithets date it to the 7th century and Parameshvara Varman."

It is located in the center of the main Mamallapuram hill. Originally a Shiva Shrine which was later converted into a shrine for the Vaishnava scholar, Ramanuja. Interesting features near the temple are steps cut in stone and leading up to the top of rock!\n\nFront of this “Three Celled” temple has six (not carved) columns covered with stone slabs. It encloses a quadrangular forecourt without roof (Probably, it existed earlier). The three cells were dedicated to Brahma, Shiva and Vishnu (?). From Pallavas to Vijayanagara Empire, none of the Shaiva images have survived; only faint remnants are traceable (most of the wall reliefs were chiselled off).\n\nHowever, between two pillars an inscription of Rudra is retained for unknown reasons – Approximately, it reads as: \"Six times cursed be those in whose hearts does not dwell “Rudra” (Siva), the saviour from the evil path (This inscription should be dated to the 7th century and Parameshvara Varman)\n\nIt is one of the Group of (40 Nos) Monuments at Mahabalipuram that were designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and presently maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India.\n\n•\tINFO:  Few out of  “What to see in Mahabalipuram” are: Shore Temple, Tiger Cave, Sculpture museum, Pancha Ratha, Krishna’s Butter Ball, Descent of Ganges (& or Penance of Arjuna), Mahabalipuram Beach, Ganesha Ratha, Varaha Cave, Sthala Sayana Perumal Temple, Mahishamardini Mandapa, Mahabalipuram lighthouse, Draupadi Ratha, Arjun Chariot, Heritage Museum, Olakkannesvara Temple, Valayankuttai Ratha, Maritime Museum, Naval Museum, Symmetric Building, Mukunda Nayanar Temple, Yudhishthir Chariot, Karukathamman Temple, Raya Gopuram, Tiger Cave, Wall Carvings, Monkey Monk (Park), Pallava Beach, Many Sculpture Manufacturing places, Many Handicrafts Shops, Etc."

During this Vaishnava resurgence, figures adorning the walls of this Ramanuja cave temple were chiselled off, the arrangement of cells at the back wall was altered, and a mandapa was added in front of the cave. The Somaskanda panel was proven to be an iconic representation of the Pallava period, which chiselled entirely because of this invasion."

              "reviewText": "A beautiful place of historical significance. On the bank of Bay of Bengal, the Pancha Rathas are rock cut monolithic structures, depicting the chariots of the five Pandavas and their wife, Draupadi. The monuments are well maintained by the Archeological survey of India. They have free parking space, drinking water and pay and use toilets. The temple complex is accessible to handicapped people as well. All the temples in Mahabalipuram can be visited by a single purchase ticket. All temples are situated close by, and are coverable within walking distance. Plenty of refreshments and food stalls to keep you full and hydrated while you visit the temples. Please keep temple premises clean and do not litter. A must visit place in Mahabalipuram."

It shares the same upapitha or secondary platform with the Draupadi Ratha.\n\nThe structure of the Arjuna Ratha is quiet simple and looks like a small palace. Although very much akin to the Dharmaraja Ratha, it differs from the latter in some respects which includes having one tier less than the latter, shape of the dome being octagonal and front yard adorned with a finely chiselled stone lion.  The garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum has a pillared Mukhamandapa or inner porch.\n\nThe entrance of the ratha rests on two pillars and two lion mounted carved pilasters. The four sides of the cornices are decorated with kudus. Simple Padabandha style is manifested from the architecture of the adhisthana which is the platform of the main deity. In-between the exquisitely carved pillars lies slit-niches that consist of figures of several deities like Siva-Vrishabhantika, Skanda on an elephant and Vishnu as also figures of apsaras, a Siddha, Parthiharas, a Chowri bearer and Amaras to mention a few. The 8 niches of the second storey consist of carved figures of couples.\n\nA figure of Lord Shiva’s mount, Nandi the bull, is housed on the rear of the ratha.\n\nPhotos by Viswas Menon\n© Viswas Menon\nWrite up compiled by Viswas Menon"

It is a monolithic rock-cut ratha with a garbhagriha/sanctum, a dvitala (two-tiered) Vimana (flying aircraft) with a mukhamandapa (inner porch). It has two levels and has one shrine. It is also square in plan. In many ways, it rhythmically mirrors the Dharmaraja ratha except that it has one less tier at the top, and has an octagonal dome . For example, the decoration and structure of cornice, kudus and the haras are similar.The shikhara of the Arjuna ratha, however, is hexagonal. we can see many sculptures dvarapalas, Vishnu, sage with a student, Indra with Iravatham (elephant),Shiva with Nandi, and the rest are human beings shown in different stages of their life including couples.\n\nIf you look at arthanareeswar sculpture strikes the twist in eyebrows, the way holding of hands slight raise of hip shows  feminity,shyness,eagerness and joy.At south side the lady on left points out someone to lady on the right,one can easily perceive that the lady on the left is pointing out the lover of the right,She is too shy to look at him directly,yet cannot retrain herself from glancing at him sideways.\n\nwill update remaining later\n\nPlease read description in photo caption.

Yes, this is an ancient lighthouse, built in the architectural style of a temple, adorned with intricate carvings of Hindu deities on its stone surfaces.\n\nA true masterpiece, it stands as a testament to a civilization that was not only highly advanced but also deeply spiritual, seamlessly blending religious devotion with technical ingenuity. The Pallava kings of that era were known for their intelligence, wisdom, and deep respect for their people. They constructed magnificent temples, but this lighthouse stands apart, proudly narrating the story of the great Hindu civilization—a legacy of unparalleled craftsmanship and vision.\n\nYou will not find anything like this anywhere else in the world. For those eager to explore Bharat’s authentic history and culture, this is an absolute must-visit destination."

You also need extra 10 rs to go up in the lighthouse!\n\nThis is honestly a wonder! It's beyond my imagination how this can exist. It's in the same place as other monuments, you can pay 40 rs for entry at the cash counter and 35 if you book online with the help of QR code."

              "reviewText": "A Memorable Trip to Mahabalipuram Beach\n\nLast October, I had the most unforgettable trip with my parents to Mahabalipuram Beach in Tamil Nadu. It was truly one of the best experiences of my life. The scenic beauty of the beach, with its golden sand and calming waves, immediately put us in a peaceful mood. The weather was perfect, and the sea breeze added to the charm of the place.\n\nWe started our day by exploring the ancient shore temple, which stands as a magnificent reminder of India's rich cultural heritage. The intricate carvings and the sound of the ocean nearby made it a magical experience. We also visited the Five Rathas and Arjuna’s Penance, which left us amazed by the craftsmanship of ancient times.\n\nSpending time on the beach with my parents was the most special part. We took long walks, collected seashells, and clicked lots of pictures. Watching the sunset together was a highlight — the sky turned shades of orange and pink, and it felt like a dream.\n\nThe local food was delicious, especially the fresh seafood served in the beachside stalls. We also shopped for handmade souvenirs and shell crafts, which added a personal touch to our trip.\n\nThis trip brought us even closer as a family. Mahabalipuram gave us not just beautiful memories but also a deep sense of joy and togetherness. I highly recommend visiting this lovely place — it’s perfect for families and those looking for peace, history, and natural beauty all in one."

The beach is less crowded than Chennai’s city beaches, making it perfect for a relaxing walk or enjoying the sea breeze.\nThe nearby rock-cut temples and monuments add a historical charm to the place. Watching the sunrise here is a magical experience, and the waves are great for photography. While swimming isn't recommended due to strong currents, the beach is ideal for unwinding and enjoying local seafood."

The temple has a really special feel to it, standing right by the coast. What really stood out to me was the architecture – it's quite remarkable and definitely the highlight of the visit. You can spend a good amount of time just admiring the intricate carvings and the overall structure, imagining the history behind it.\nBased on my experience, I'd strongly suggest planning your visit during the daytime. The sunlight truly brings out the details in the stonework and allows you to appreciate the craftsmanship fully. Seeing it illuminated by natural light makes a significant difference compared to dimmer conditions. It's a fascinating piece of history, and seeing the architectural details clearly is key to the experience. Definitely a worthwhile stop if you appreciate historical sites and impressive architecture!"

The stone carvings and the overall setting make it a must visit for anyone interested in history and culture.\n\nHowever, there are a few practical concerns for visitors: professional cameras are not allowed inside, and unfortunately, there is no locker facility to keep your belongings safe. Kindhearted security guards may suggest leaving items in their office on a goodwill, but that’s not advisable for own sake. It’s best to travel light when visiting. Also, tickets can be booked online in advance in discounted price, which saves time and avoids hassle at the counter.\n\nA magnificent site, but experience can be smoother by Archaeological Department."

I would recommend visiting hear outside of direct noon sunlight because it will be extremely hot in the noon ( please refer to visiting time ).\n\nDuring our visit, most of the actual temple area in the immediate vicinity had renovation/maintenance going on. But nothing that would hinder  usual exploration and photography.\n\nAll area inside the outer fencing and beach boundary is well maintained and clean."

              "reviewText": "During my recent trip to Mahabalipuram, one of the highlights was visiting the Pancha Rathas—an awe-inspiring group of rock-cut temples that left me speechless. It’s one of those places where history whispers through stone, and every structure tells a story carved centuries ago.\n\nA Glimpse into the Past\n\nThe Pancha Rathas, also known as the Five Rathas, are monolithic rock temples carved in the 7th century during the reign of the Pallava king Narasimhavarman I. What amazed me most was that each ratha (chariot) is carved from a single granite stone—yes, a single giant rock! They are named after the Pandavas and Draupadi from the Mahabharata, though interestingly, they have no actual connection to the characters. These structures were more like architectural experiments by the Pallavas, laying the foundation for later Dravidian temple designs.\n\nBeauty Carved in Stone\n\nEach ratha has its own distinct style and charm. Dharmaraja Ratha is the tallest and most ornate, while Draupadi Ratha, though small, is beautifully carved like a thatched hut. The Bhima Ratha stood out with its long hall-like structure. Life-sized sculptures of animals like lions and a majestic elephant add a mythical vibe to the site. The whole area has a serene, ancient energy—perfect for soaking in history while admiring fine craftsmanship.\n\nGetting There\n\nReaching Pancha Rathas is quite easy. I took a short drive from Chennai, which is about 60 km away. The roads are good, and the scenic drive along the East Coast Road (ECR) makes the journey enjoyable. If you prefer public transport, buses and taxis are readily available from Chennai and nearby towns like Chengalpattu.\n\nBest Time to Visit\n\nI visited in the early morning, which was perfect. The weather was pleasant, the crowd was thin, and the golden light added an extra glow to the stone carvings. The best time to visit Mahabalipuram is between November and February when the climate is cooler and ideal for sightseeing. Try to avoid the peak afternoon sun—these rocks can get pretty hot!\n\nFinal Thoughts\nPancha Rathas is more than just an archaeological site—it’s a silent storyteller of India’s rich heritage. Standing amidst these 1,300-year-old marvels made me feel deeply connected to the past. If you love history, architecture, or just serene places with character, this should be high on your list.\n\nPro tip: Don’t forget to carry water, wear a hat, and take your time exploring each ratha—it’s worth it."

              "reviewText": "A must-visit historic site in Mahabalipuram! The Five Rathas are an incredible example of ancient Indian rock-cut architecture, each carved from a single stone and beautifully detailed. Each ratha is dedicated to different characters from the Mahabharata, and the craftsmanship is truly awe-inspiring.\n\nThe place is well maintained, with information boards to guide you. It's fascinating to see how these structures have survived centuries and still stand strong. The atmosphere is peaceful, and it's a great spot for photography and history lovers.\n\nTry to visit early in the morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat, and combine it with other nearby monuments. Definitely worth the trip!"

The entrance fee for Indian nationals was ₹40, while foreign visitors were charged ₹600.\n\nThe monument is an exemplary showcase of ancient Indian architecture and sculpture. The five rathas, named after the Pandavas from the Mahabharata - Bheem, Sahadev, Nakul, Draupadi, and Arjun - are magnificent structures that demonstrate the skill and craftsmanship of the Pallava dynasty.\n\nThe intricate carvings, sculptures, and architecture of the rathas are breathtaking. The monument is a testament to India's rich cultural heritage and history.\n\nI highly recommend visiting the Five Rathas monument to experience its grandeur and historical significance.\n\nRating: 5/5 stars\n\nRecommended for: History enthusiasts, architecture buffs, and cultural aficionados.\""

It turned out to be one of the best and most memorable trips we’ve had as a family.\n\nAs we entered the site, we were immediately captivated by the incredible rock-cut structures. The Pancha Rathas, also known as the Five Rathas, are monolithic temples carved from a single granite rock — each one dedicated to a Pandava from the Mahabharata. The detailing, the size, and the symmetry of the architecture left us spellbound.\n\nWalking among these majestic structures, we felt like we had stepped back in time. My parents were fascinated by the history and the stories associated with each ratha. We spent hours admiring the carvings, taking photos, and learning about the Pallava dynasty’s craftsmanship.\n\nThe peaceful environment, gentle breeze, and natural surroundings made the visit even more enjoyable. We laughed, explored, and shared snacks under the shade of trees — simple moments that made the day truly special.\n\nThis trip was not just about seeing a historical monument; it was about creating lasting memories with my parents. The beauty, history, and serenity of Pancha Rathas brought us closer together and gave us a deeper appreciation for India’s rich cultural heritage.\n\nI would highly recommend visiting Pancha Rathas to anyone who loves history, art, and spending meaningful time with family."

You expect a certain level of service and comfort at this price point, but Grande Bay falls short on both. Nevertheless the rooms are neat and tidy, comfortable for a 2 day stay.\n\nTheir so-called \"high tea\" experience was poorly managed. Guests were made to wait in the hot sun just for a cup of tea, while staff stood around complaining about the crowd among themselves — highly unprofessional. What was even more disappointing was the clear bias in the way guests were treated, seemingly based on the language they spoke. This kind of discriminatory behavior is unacceptable and leaves a bad taste.\n\nThe breakfast buffet, which was included in the package, was far from a real buffet. The spread was extremely limited and the food itself was underwhelming in taste, and the service was incredibly slow. Again, we were left waiting — this time at the table — for basic breakfast items.\n\nOverall, the experience was frustrating and not reflective of the hospitality standards one would expect from a place like this. Grande Bay needs serious improvements in both service quality and attitude toward guests. I would not recommend it based on my stay."

Definitely it was very heart warming to see everyone in the support team were good.\n\nComing to the food - Wow, not spicy, yet tasted good, stomach safe for kids and Adults, Limited menu in the buffet, still all the food was too good , chicken was fresh, paneer was too good, Breakfast was having different options for you, Pongal was the highlight , too yummy. We enjoyed Breakfast. Lunch too We had tried Breads and paneer, chicken gravies, all were good. Fried rice was good. Everything We ordered was too good, I would rate 5/5 for food.\n\nOnly thing is , we don't have Idli or dosa varieties for dinner, if they can add it, it will be good.\n\nI would highly recommend Challet rooms for everyone to get a different experience, it will be nice. Garden view balcony in ground floor, balcony in the 1st floor. Good view, too relaxing in the morning and evening.\n\nWe liked and would soon plan our next visit there again.\n\nThanks to all the staffs."

For long we have been thinking that the resort is not beach front and now realised that they have a huge area/ground infront of beach with private entrance  200 mtrs away from the resort..though walkable.. they are providing buggy to and fro as and when we wish..so good. They have all out door games ( volleyball court, badminton, tug of war rope, uri addithal, tennicut) with good lawn and children play area etc.\nBack in resort very friendly reception staff welcomed with welcome drink on our arrival and guided to our room. AC in the room was very effective, hot and cold water in the bathroom 24/7.  Spacious room with sit out and terrace. Ample car park area. Large swimming pool maintained well. Breakfast buffet was excellent. Hi tea was more than expected with variety of bajjies, tea cake, cookies and savouries. However on the day of our visit the occupancy was low. Friendly staff, well secured place and the location of the resort is very near to all the places of tourist interest."

The pool area provides a perfect setting for relaxation and soaking up the sun, with picturesque views that make for an idyllic retreat.\n\nHowever, while the beauty of the resort is undeniable, I felt that there were a few aspects that could have enhanced the overall experience. One of my main suggestions would be to incorporate outdoor bars that serve refreshing frozen drinks and coconut waters. This addition would not only cater to guests looking for a cool treat on hot days but also create a more vibrant and festive atmosphere by the poolside.\n\nMoreover, a little music would go a long way in adding to the resort’s charm. Soft tunes playing in the background would create a more inviting ambiance, making it feel more like a true resort where guests can unwind and enjoy their surroundings especially if they would like to cater to international tourists."

Initially the staff was abrupt in telling me that it is not there and then I asked him what are the facilities in the resort the guy was crude enough to say that it should be understandable later . No maps were given we had to ask for it. Then he said they will try to upgrade me late after a day. When called they said it was not available even though a lot of rooms are free. They do not  explain what is eligible for you as a Radisson member. I think the hospitality team  and the front office team needs to be trained properly. The staff are hard working but not polite no one  even smiles.. they do not explain where the restaurants are located if a person comes just for a day half of them might not know where high tea is served .. The premises is really good and well maintained but the front office team and the rest of the team needs to be trained to be friendly and more hospitable. Even the breakfast team is not so friendly\nbut a few staff are really nice. Also the way they treat Radisson members is not according to Radisson policy which is sad.  I am supposed to stay in this hotel for 3 nights let's see whether things would change"

It truly felt like they cared about making our visit as comfortable and enjoyable as possible.\n\nOverall Experience:\n\nIn addition to the fantastic food and excellent hospitality, the resort offered a range of activities and a beautiful setting that made our trip unforgettable.

From the initial planning to the final wrap up, every detail was handled with such care and precision, thanks to the excellent coordination by Mr. Senthil. He ensured that everything from getting the pricing right to organizing each element was spot on.\n\nWe were a large team of 300 members, and yet, the entire event ran smoothly without a hitch. A special thanks to Priya, who managed the welcome, tagging, and smooth entry to the Waves location with great attention to detail.\n\nA big appreciation goes to Kandhan, who was instrumental in overall event management. From coordinating logistics to supporting every aspect of the day, his efforts ensured everything ran seamlessly and efficiently behind the scenes.\n\nThe food experience was another major highlight\nLast year, we were delighted by Chef Munnusamy, whose dishes left a lasting impression, and this time, Chef Manoj matched that same level of excellence. We were happy to know they are part of the same talented culinary team. The food was flavorful, fresh, and satisfying — just what we needed after a day full of engaging activities.\n\nThe overall atmosphere was simply fantabulous — relaxing, energizing, and filled with joy. Whether it was the scenic beachside setting, the thoughtful hospitality, or the delicious food, Ideal Beach Resort delivered an experience our team will remember and cherish.\n\nHighly recommended for corporate outings, team retreats, or any group event where you want the perfect mix of nature, comfort, and top notch service."

              "reviewText": "The beach resort was truly ideal starting with the welcoming, hassle free check in, ambience and the beach vibes. Everything was great. The private beach is beautiful with a couple of hammocks to chill.\nAfter checking in we explored around the property and we found that there's lot of space where we could have fun, conduct music jams or just chill with friends or family.\n\nThe pizza from pizza mechanic ( this is a restaurant on the beach) was huge for two people but it was scrumptious. I'd recommend that their 12 inch pizza can be shared by atleast 4 people.\n\nTheir continental restaurant has both a-la-carte and buffet options. The complimentary breakfast buffet was fulfilling,  delicious and good. But I felt that the English breakfast tasted slightly better than the south Indian platter. Emphasis on the slight.\n\nThe only negative was that the tea / coffee that was available at the beach and room service was very average, although priced at a premium. Comparatively the tea/coffee that was available at the breakfast buffet was delicious.\n\nI also recommend that if there are more south Indian items available for lunch and dinner,  it'll be great. To come to Mahabalipuram(in tamilnadu) and not trying some authentic tamil food for lunch or dinner was a slight letdown.\n\nThe gym seems to be well equipped.  There was a bigger swimming pool for adults and a tiny one for the kids but you can't use the pool without appropriate swim wear.\nThere is a Handcrafted goods store and a clothes boutique for some kalamkari shopping. There are a couple of party halls and a huge wedding hall in the property as well."

Swimming pool was very neat and clean also the depth is 9 feet maximum which is amazing. Price is little on the higher side but it is worth it. I did not find any indoor games or play area but there is outdoor beach volleyball,  giant chess and nice relaxing place in the beach. Morning breakfast is just amazing, they had almost 40-50 items. Rooms were amazing specially the higher price section one. They have villa type rooms. Overall 4.7/5\nImprovements - indoor games and other fun activity needed, if there it was not properly informed."

The location and soft product were great, but the rooms were mediocre at best. The juice at the check in counter was a nice touch, and the electric buggy ride to your room was also a nice touch. When you get to your room is when you can see that it is long overdue a renovation. The bathrooms have pen or pencil written on the ceiling. The edges where the wall meets the floor have built up mold. The dispenser for shower gel, shampoo, and conditioner doesn’t dispense properly. The hotel room key holder that is supposed to turn on all the lights when you insert the room key into it doesn’t work properly. And generally, things around the room that have wood finishes or are painted are starting to chip off and “corrode.” The pool was shut down for repairs but when my sister called the day before they had said that it was indeed open and functional. There is access to a beach,  however there are no activities or water sports available, even paid. As far as entertainment in the resort apart from the pool, they have a ping pong and pool table, but all outside. For group activities they have cricket equipment. Food was also just okay, I would suggest to skip the dinner buffet and do a la carte dining. If they ever do renovations to the property, it will become a 5 star resort."

Though calling the receptionist requesting to address this issue, none showed up. AC cooling was low and the fan was noisy. Had a medium comfort sleep for a night. Dining room was small to accommodate everyone during the breakfast and lunch. We had to wait for an hour to get seats. Foods were decent - noting to complain about it.\n\nResort must address these issues right away and check the room first before allocation."

Standing proudly on the shores of the Bay of Bengal, this 8th-century marvel is one of the oldest stone temples in South India and a testament to the rich architectural heritage of the Pallava dynasty.\n\nThe temple’s stunning location – right by the sea – adds a mystical charm.

The carvings on the granite stones are incredibly detailed, showcasing stories from Hindu mythology and the craftsmanship of ancient artisans.\n\nThe entire complex is well-maintained, and the early morning or sunset views are breathtaking. It’s not just a visit to a historical monument; it feels like a spiritual and cultural journey. Ideal for history buffs, architecture lovers, photographers, and peace seekers alike.\n\n✅ Tips:\n•\tVisit early morning or during sunset for the best lighting and weather.\n•\tWear comfortable shoes – it’s a walking site.\n•\tDon’t forget to explore the nearby Five Rathas and Arjuna’s Penance."

The expressions carved on the figures feel so lifelike, as if they are frozen in time\n\nStanding before it, the sheer scale and craftsmanship leave you in awe. But finding a quiet moment to admire the beauty is tough, as crowds keep flowing in, making it hard to take in the intricate details peacefully"

The sheer size and scale of the structures are so vast that capturing them in a single image is nearly impossible. Visitors from around the world come to admire the intricate carvings and experience the essence of ancient Indian history. Since all the major attractions are best explored on foot, carrying a water bottle is advisable, especially on hot days. It's a wonderful place to spend a peaceful evening with family, soaking in the beauty of history and nature."

It’s best to visit early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat and crowds.\n\nGreat for history lovers, photographers, and anyone who wants to experience India’s ancient art and architecture up close.

The sheer size and detail of the bas-relief are awe-inspiring. You can easily spend 30–45 minutes just admiring the stories etched into the rock — from gods and animals to sages and celestial beings.\n\nThe location is clean, walkable, and filled with other beautiful monuments nearby like the Krishna Butter Ball and the Shore Temple. It’s best to visit early morning or late afternoon to avoid the heat and crowds.\n\nGreat for history lovers, photographers, and anyone who wants to experience India’s ancient art and architecture up close. Highly recommend stopping here if you’re in or around Mahabalipuram!"

The sheer size and scale of the structures are so vast that capturing them in a single image is nearly impossible.

Since all the major attractions are best explored on foot, carrying a water bottle is advisable, especially on hot days. It's a wonderful place to spend a peaceful evening with family, soaking in the beauty of history and nature."

Nestled in Mahabalipuram, this museum is a true treasure trove for anyone curious about the ocean and its wonders.\n\nFrom the moment we stepped inside, we were impressed by the sheer variety and detail in the seashell collection. It’s hard to believe such an extensive and beautifully curated museum exists in India! There are thousands of shells on display—from the tiniest micro-shells to large, rare, and intricately shaped marine specimens. Each section is thoughtfully laid out, with clear information and a lot of interesting facts, making the visit not just enjoyable but also educational.\n\nOur little daughter had a great time too! She was full of curiosity, crawling around happily and enjoying the colorful displays and the calm indoor atmosphere. The museum is clean, well-organized, and safe for families with small children.\n\nThey also have additional attractions like a small aquarium and a gift shop, where you can buy unique shell-based souvenirs. The staff were polite and helpful, and the entire place had a peaceful vibe that added to the charm of the visit.\n\nOverall, the India Seashell Museum is a wonderful destination for families, nature lovers, and anyone interested in marine life. It’s informative, peaceful, and quite unique—definitely worth including in your Mahabalipuram itinerary."

It stands out as one of the largest seashell museums in Asia, offering a unique experience for visitors interested in marine life and natural history. The museum complex also includes additional attractions like a Pearl Museum, Fishing Museum, and even a Dinosaur Park, making it a multi-theme destination suitable for families and children.\n\nEach section of the complex has a separate entry fee, though a combined entry ticket is available for approximately ₹800. While the pricing may feel a bit steep, the air-conditioned interiors and the shade make it a great mid-day stop, especially when the sun is at its peak. Planning your day to visit other Mahabalipuram landmarks in the morning or evening and this museum during the hotter hours is a smart move.\n\nThe exhibits are well-curated, and a visit of 1–2 hours is generally enough to explore the entire complex. Although the entry fee might seem expensive to some, the variety and uniqueness of the exhibits make it worth a visit for those interested in natural curiosities and marine collections."

I remember walking up the rocky path under the warm sun, and the moment I saw that giant boulder perfectly balanced on a slope, I was speechless — how could something so big just stand there, untouched for centuries? 😮🙏 I sat beneath it with my cousins, half nervous it might roll, half amazed by its calm presence. We laughed, clicked funny pictures pretending to hold it up, and shared stories under its shadow 📸😂. It wasn’t just a tourist spot — it felt like a moment of connection with nature, history, and my loved ones. A simple rock, but a memory that will stay in my heart forever 💖🌞."

This unique and mysterious giant rock, balanced on a slope, left us all amazed and full of wonder.\n\nThe atmosphere was vibrant and filled with the laughter of tourists, children running around, and families capturing memories. We were fascinated by how this massive boulder, weighing over 250 tons, has remained unmoved for centuries — almost defying gravity! Standing beside it, we couldn’t stop admiring nature’s miracle and the historical charm surrounding it.\n\nExploring the area was both fun and relaxing. We climbed nearby rocks, took dozens of photos, and enjoyed the scenic views all around. The weather was pleasant, and the cool breeze made the entire experience even more refreshing. My parents, too, were thrilled and kept talking about the uniqueness of the place.\n\nOne of the highlights was simply sitting on the grass, enjoying some local snacks, and soaking in the peaceful surroundings. The trip wasn’t just about sightseeing, but also about bonding, laughter, and quality time together.\n\nKrishna’s Butterball, with its playful name and incredible presence, gave us memories that we will always treasure. Visiting this spot made us feel connected to both nature and history. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a light-hearted yet awe-inspiring travel experience with family."

The gigantic boulder perched so delicately on a slope looks almost impossible, yet it has stood there for centuries without moving an inch. The spot is peaceful yet lively, with families enjoying picnics and children rolling down the grassy hill. It’s not just a monument but an experience—you feel the magic of balance and the mystery of time. A must-visit landmark in Mahabalipuram, perfect for photos and soaking in the charm of this ancient coastal town.\""

This massive granite boulder, precariously perched on a slope, is a testament to the incredible laws of physics.\n\nAs I watched, awestruck, I couldn't help but wonder how this massive rock had defied gravity for centuries. The sheer magnitude of the boulder, combined with its seemingly impossible balance, left me speechless.\n\nWhat struck me most, however, was the diverse crowd of visitors from all over India and the world. People of all ages, cultures, and backgrounds had gathered to marvel at this natural wonder. It was heartwarming to see strangers becoming fast friends, bonding over their shared wonder.\n\nKrishna's Butter Ball is truly a beautiful place that must be experienced. It's a reminder of the awe-inspiring power of nature and the incredible secrets that physics holds. If you ever find yourself in Mahabalipuram, do not miss this incredible attraction!\n\nRating: 5/5 stars\""

The sight of that giant boulder, mysteriously balanced on a slope for centuries, left us completely amazed — how could something so massive just stay there, untouched by time? We climbed nearby rocks, sat beneath the boulder half in awe and half playfully nervous, and took dozens of funny pictures pretending to hold it up. The warm sun, cool breeze, and laughter made the day even more special. Sharing snacks on the grass and stories under its shadow, we realized this wasn’t just sightseeing — it was a beautiful blend of history, nature, and pure fun. A simple rock, yet a memory we’ll treasure forever.."

The property is vast, beautifully maintained, and opens right onto a stunning stretch of beach soft sand, clean waves, and pure serenity.\n\nThe staff were incredibly warm, helpful, and attentive. Every interaction felt genuine and full of care. Special thanks to the front desk and housekeeping and restaurant  staffs for making everything seamless.\n\nMy room was spacious, spotless, and perfectly comfortable, with a lovely view and the sound of the ocean in the background. The pool area is a total highlight ideal for both relaxation and fun. And the food? Outstanding. Every meal at their restaurants was fresh, flavorful, and served with grace. The seafood in particular was a standout.\n\nThe resort is perfectly located near all of Mahabalipuram’s major sights like the Shore Temple and Five Rathas—which made exploring effortless. But honestly, just being on the property itself is an experience.\n\nWhether you’re coming to unwind, explore heritage, or just escape into nature, this place delivers. I left feeling recharged, inspired, and already dreaming of my next visit.\n\nHighly, highly recommended."

              "reviewText": "Chariot Beach Resort, Mahabalipuram (Stay: 18–20 April 2025)\nApril 2025\n\nWe stayed at Chariot Beach Resort for two nights (18–20 April'25) , having booked an Executive Deluxe room with an extra bed. While the property itself is spacious and scenic, the overall experience was disappointing, especially considering the premium price point.\n\nThe room was average, and the bathroom appeared more like a makeshift setup—far below expectations. Key amenities were either missing or non-functional: the hair dryer didn’t work initially (a replacement was provided later), the television wasn’t working throughout the stay despite multiple complaints, and there was no hot water. Returning drenched from the beach, both my children (aged 1 and 6) had to bathe in cold water, and the chill even caused discomfort to my elder kid.\n\nRepeated complaints about the TV and hot water went unanswered. The staff seemed unresponsive, and resolution came only after escalation by Chef Karthik—who, despite it being outside his scope, was proactive and supportive. Eventually, we were moved to a cottage at 10 PM on the second night, which felt too little, too late.\n\nOne saving grace was the team at the restaurant. Chef Karthik and his superior were genuinely thoughtful, and the GM himself assisted in preparing baby food—something the hotel does not charge for, which was appreciated. The pool was another highlight, with the kids thoroughly enjoying their time there.\n\nOverall, while the property has potential, the lack of basic room checks and poor responsiveness to issues made the experience underwhelming. Hope the management works on service quality to match the property's promise."

The resort is set on a huge property with rooms located conveniently close to the beach, and the staff were courteous and helpful throughout our stay.\n\nThe swimming pool is spacious, with a good number of shower areas and towels available, which added to the comfort.\n\nHowever, the rooms did not quite match the price point — the AC was quite loud, and the bathrooms were maintained at a basic level. The breakfast buffet spread was limited, with a strong focus on South Indian cuisine and very few continental options.\n\nFor a resort of this scale and pricing, there’s definitely room for improvement in the overall standard and upkeep of the rooms."

I entered the pool and got eye irritation. it's unsafe to have such a pool and a waste of money, an amenity shown prominently to the cost of a guest's ticket.was unable to use it, not fit for swimming . was like a village pond, rather than a class hotel's swimming pool. the toilet flush was not working , we had to call three times , to get it rectified. the hot water wasnt turned on, only after calling it started working. There was a bad rotten stench at the beach, that may be out of their control, some dead rat or something. The other complaints need attention, it did impact our stay and significantly ruined any hopes of calling it a pleasant stay. the room was clean, view was good from the window.the front desk was courteous. but the restaurant denied ala carte for dinner.That was a turnoff. I have pictures of the swimming pool, for a guest paying rs 13k for a night, I feel, my experience needs to be better compensated.I hadn’t yet posted a public review, waited for their response,but no response to email .I did want to meet the operation manager during checkout, but he/she was on leave , not onsite, a ruse ?"

There was no hair dryer. It had free water to drink and some snacks , and it didn’t say anywhere that the snacks were paid. We were charged inr 500 for 3 snacks which our guest ate without knowing. A message next to the snacks would have been good.\n\nThe property was okay - it has a pool, but some of the tiles were broken, so they offered water shoes. There was an activity room that had decent things to play for kids and adults like table tennis and billiards. We didn’t try the paid activities.\n\nThe beach was also good but it was a red day so we couldn’t wade into the water.\n\nService was good. People were helpful and were responsive in the property.\n\nBreakfast buffet was decent, lots of fresh vegetarian options but I was unhappy to see that some food was open to the air and had flies sitting on it, till I asked to them cover it. Easy to fall sick.\n\nIt was alright stay. I was not super impressed, but I’ll give them points for their service."

For spa, they informed that the printed rate is the final bill including tax, but while paying they charged the taxes. When we confronted her, she lies straight way that she told that the printed rate is excluding tax.\n\n2. Swimming pool water was very hard as it was full of chlorine and it was under maintained.\n\n3. We were made to wait for 45 minutes after giving order for lunch.\n4. Lack of coordination between staff. Even after waiting for 40 minutes for buggy, we had to walk finally.\n5. Water bottle brate was 20, but they charged 123 including tax which is illegal. Anyway, I am going to file a consumer court complaint for it.\n\n6. Most of the staff are new hires. I would advise if anyone is opting their service, you should confirm with the billing desk.\n\n7. So overall the price of stay in the resort did not matched the service they provided.\n\nThanks"

When we arrived we were shown to our Oceanfront Room with an indicated in-room temperature of 92 degrees Fahrenheit! A Technician was called and by bedtime the temperature was at 88 degrees -- 7 hours after arrival. During the night they offered us the adjoining Suite -- a larger room that was at 88 degrees as well. By morning our original room was at a balmy 86 degrees. Uninhabitable! Management offered us a room at their sister Hotel -- Silversands Beach. That room was immediately adjacent to an outdoor Restaurant not part of the Hotel. Relaxing? Being handicapped, that mountainous Property was not appropriate at all.  We told Management that we could not endure these conditions and were leaving. After meeting with the Manager, we were offered a $1600 Courtesy Refund against the $8000 we had prepaid. They stressed \"NO REFUNDS\"! With no choice we left anyway and found a wonderful oceanfront Hotel a mile away to have the \"relaxing vacation\" we counted on. Management at Silversands was completely unapologetic about the insufficient A/C, and zeroed in only on the 2 options they offered us. In addition, their \"highly touted\" Infinity Pool was under construction with 7 workers constantly drilling and hammering that went on until 7:30 PM that first and only night. If you are considering this Property do yourself a favor and consider my review. Have I ever lied to you before? Conde Nast -- SHAME ON YOU! Silversands Resort -- SHAME ON YOU!

The cost is above par.\nProperty location is very good. It is managed only by few guys and hence service might not be upto the expectation of a resort.\nSwimming pool is very good and well maintained. The food inside is extremely costly and does not have much variety. While, you may think of getting food from outside (not much options though)"

The room was lovely and spacious, with an amazing big hammam-style bathroom and an additional outdoors shower, which was a highlight. The quiet and clean beach is a 2min walk away, and their very simple restaurant right by the beach. The pool also has sea view and gets a lovely breeze. Definitely take advantage of the room service - Velu, one of the staff members, created some really beautiful and impressive towel sculptures for us.\nOverall a very enjoyable stay."

However, the quality of hospitality has drastically declined over time.\nDuring my recent stay with extended family and kids, we booked 2 rooms for 2 nights . What we received was highly disappointing—2 small Santoor soaps, 3 Clinic Plus shampoo sachets, worn-out towels, and just 2 small water bottles. On the second day, we were informed that the rooms wouldn’t be cleaned, bedsheets and towels wouldn’t be changed, and no additional water bottles would be provided, which are basic necessities for any stay.\nI strongly do not recommend this place for anyone planning a family stay. The standards have fallen far below expectations."

The choice of opting for Meya turned out to be a great option considering they're in close proximity of the town but away from the crowd, and right by the beach.\n\nThe property is enticing with a beautiful entrance with good ambiance and foliage, and the staff greeting you with a wide grin & brilliant hospitality. Ms. Kavita was kind enough to ensure the check-in process was smooth with no hassles, and the proprietor, Mr. Bhaskaran, was there to assist for any requirements.\n\nGood seating area outside the rooms, and the rooms themselves are quite spacious with a rustic vibe. However, some maintenance is required in the washroom with leaky taps.\n\nThe restaurant - May1,  is by the beach, ~100m away, and serves good food with the Manager, Mr. Ramesh, offering incredible hospitality and kindness in ensuring the customers are well taken care off.\n\nOnly qualm is the parking isn't sufficient with cars parked in as well.\n\nLooking forward to the next stay. Would recommend."

It’s quite large, with enough room for someone to sit and look out over the nearby village and hills. At one end, there’s a carved lion that faces north. It dates back to the Pallava period in the seventh century, and while it carries a local tale linking it to Yuddhishtira from the Mahabharata, it’s believed to be a royal seat carved for a king who would pause and survey the land.\n\nReaching the throne only takes a short climb. Climbing up, you sense how naturally the craftsmen shaped it right into the rock, using both myth and landscape in their work. When seated, the breeze around you feels freeing, and the view spreads out below in a calming, almost meditative way.\n\nMost visitors spend around thirty minutes here. It’s a quiet spot showing how art, history, and nature blend together. It doesn’t feel like a tourist trap but more like a gentle reminder of how life and power used to connect with these lands and legends."

              "reviewText": "​The Mahishasuramardini Cave at Mahabalipuram, a UNESCO World Heritage site, stands as a prime example of Pallava dynasty rock-cut architecture.  Dated to the 7th century CE, this cave temple is a testament to the artistic and engineering prowess of the Pallava kings, particularly King Mahendravarman I or his son, Narasimhavarman I. Carved from a single large rock, its simple yet elegant facade features a pillared porch and three cells, or shrines, at the rear. The pillars are slender and fluted, a distinctive feature of early Pallava architecture. The cave's design beautifully integrates a natural rock formation with intricate sculptural work, creating a sacred space that feels both monumental and intimate.\n\n​The cave's interior is renowned for its magnificent bas-relief panels, which are the focal point of the temple's artistic expression. The northern wall features a stunning panel depicting the slumber of Vishnu, known as Anantashayana. In this serene scene, Lord Vishnu is shown reclining on the cosmic serpent Adishesha, surrounded by various divine and human figures. The composition is calm and harmonious, with a sense of cosmic tranquility that contrasts sharply with the dynamic scene on the opposite wall.\n​On the southern wall, the cave's namesake, the Mahishasuramardini panel, comes to life with incredible energy and detail. This dynamic sculpture depicts the goddess Durga engaged in a fierce battle with the buffalo-headed demon Mahishasura. Durga is shown in a triumphant pose, mounted on her lion and wielding a bow, while her adversaries are in a state of chaotic defeat. The scene is full of movement, tension, and power, with figures frozen in mid-action. This panel is considered a masterpiece of Indian art, capturing the emotional intensity and drama of the mythological narrative.\n​The Mahishasuramardini Cave, while seemingly simple in its architectural form, is a profound cultural and religious artifact. It not only represents a significant phase in the development of rock-cut temples in Southern India but also serves as a powerful medium for storytelling through stone. The contrasting panels of Vishnu's slumber and Durga's battle encapsulate the duality of divine power the tranquil and the fierce. A visit to this cave is a journey back in time, allowing one to stand in awe of a bygone era's faith, artistic vision, and unwavering devotion, forever immortalized in the granite of Mahabalipuram."

One of these depicts Lord Vishnu sleeping on top of the coils of the king of serpents, Adisesha, while another relief displays Goddess Durga, atop her lion, fighting with the demon Mahishasura. Apart from these two bas-reliefs, the shrine in the centre of the temple holds an idol of Lord Murugan, seated between Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Carved out of rocks, the temple depicts scenes from ancient Hindu epics, Puranas. The cave temple belongs to the 7th century, constructed under the Pallava dynasty (275 CE to 897 CE). The cave is a testimony to the fine craftsmanship of the Vishwakarma sculptors of that time."

I left at 11 AM in Bengaluru to reach Daphne Hotel ( Mahabalipuram ) by 7:30 PM.\n\nI took 3 day course (everyday 90 minutes) under Kishore (our guide). He is the best instructor. I was able to surf somehow on the first day.\n\nFor people working from home, you can take the morning session, and still do your office.\n\nMahabalipuram is a very good place for surfing. The place hosts many national and international championships. People from other countries come to learn surfing here too. I met a German lady in the same hotel, though she broke her leg while surfing (she was an old lady).\n\nSurfing does not require swimming at this place, but if you know swimming, you will have extra confidence over water.\n\nMahabalipuram as a place is empty, there are some good resorts, and it has a temple on the beach. Apart from this, I only liked surfing.\n\nThis is the nearest place from Bengaluru where you can learn to surf and reach by road.\n\nExtras:-\n1. You can rent surf boards and have fun all day.\n2. Wifi provided by Hotel did not work. My Airtel 5G worked very good.\n3. I went in June, AC room was not required. Shops outside close early, and open late.\n4. Try to wear full body swim suits, as you may be lucky and get sting by Jelly fish."

It was smelling bad like people are not coming to the resort. The cupboard doors were broken. When I asked reception they said this is the only room. The whole resort was empty only 4 rooms were booked that day. I checked it in the morning during breakfast.\nEven though the resort touched the beach but management is not capable to maintain the entity.

The party took place outside of the hotel on the lawn, which was beautifully decorated and set up by the hotel staff.<br/>They had a live dosa and pasta counter set up alongside the buffet, which I liked. They served both veg and non veg, and I must say that  I enjoyed all the dishes that I tasted. The food was fresh and of good quality, so that made it more appealing.<br/>Overall, I would highly recommend this hotel for their ambience, food and service, especially its location as it is only few meters away from the sea shell museum."

This is an excellent property- a large Chettiinaf style villa, just about 200 meters off the highway and located close to the beach. There are four large rooms - two each on the ground and upper floor, a large open courtyard and patio - all very well and tastefully furnished. Bed linens were clean.\nAll bedrooms have large attached bathrooms. Basic amenities and towels are provided in these.\nDining table can accommodate 8 persons comfortably\nThere is a nice library in the upper floor. The Terrance offers a view of the Bay of Bengal.\nCovered parking is adequate for two mid sized SUVs- extra cars can be parked in the open.\nThere is DG back up - so no need to worry about the power fluctuation\nMs Ilaivarassy, the caretaker is attentive, efficient, courteous and a great cook !\nOverall a good and cost effective place to stay !\n\nPS - one suggestion for improvement is to get the access road surface done up. There are many ditches and sharp rock edges on this narrow stretch which makes driving in a tedious experience. The owner was very accommodating on couple of other small feedback given during our stay- hope this major requirement also gets her attention!"

We had a fantastic time. It was just perfect for our family and the food served by Illavarasi was an added bonus. Tasty, home food and she could cook whatever we asked for.\n\nThe house was spacious and a lot of room to just sit around and chat or play board games and relax. The host has set up this house with at most care to make it absolutely delightful stay for anyone. Though the beach is very close we did not use the beach too often since we had more than enough to keep us occupied and relaxed in the house...also the beach was quite filthy.\n\nRadha was a great and kind host. Always responded to our queries immediately went out of the way to make our stay comfortable. Thank you!"

When we arrived at the hotel, we had to wait for half an hour as they were cleaning the rooms. Also it's nice to have a swimming pool but it's a pitty you cannot use it because it's dirty. Make it cheaper or put a little more effort in customer service and cleaning please. The location is good though."

The property was obviously developed with high expectations, but now has a run down feel with negligent standards of service. You have to ask for even simple things like towels and soap. One room had only one pillow on a double bed, without pillow covers. The pool needs tending and has bugs that have made it a home. Water wastage is criminal with leaking pipes and overflowing tanks. Our overhead tank overflowed all night creating a racket next to our room and no one was there to tend to it when we tried informing the staff (after 8pm there are no staff)! The property has potential, but the management needs to really brush up their tardy act. And the prices they charge are certainly not justifies for all these lapses. It supposedly is on Oyo, but no oyo standard is maintained here."

Second day went a step ahead asking me to pay the entire room tariff once again cause they haven't received the payment from goibibo. Were asking me to pay in cash and settle it with Goibibo seperately. Had to ask for the Managing Director to get it sorted. Nobody in the premises speaks English. Absolutely pathetic.
