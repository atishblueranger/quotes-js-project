The entry fee is ₹80 per person (as of January 2025), which is reasonable considering the exclusivity of the place.\n\nThe beach itself is pristine, with clear waters and a peaceful ambiance, making it perfect for relaxing, taking pictures, or just enjoying the waves. There are also activities like quad biking and tubing (being dragged behind a speedboat in a vessel), adding some adventure to the experience.\n\nHowever, the maintenance of facilities needs serious improvement. The washrooms and changing rooms are not clean, and the shower area is combined, which might make some visitors uncomfortable. Additionally, the food shacks are quite average, and some amenities were not operational during our visit.\n\nOverall, Paradise Beach is a great place to unwind and enjoy nature, but the management should focus on improving cleanliness and maintaining the facilities properly. If you're visiting, go for the beach and the vibe, but keep your expectations in check regarding amenities.\n\n✨ Pros: Beautiful beach, clean surroundings, peaceful vibe, fun water activities.\n⚠️ Cons: Poor maintenance of washrooms & showers, average food options, some facilities not working.",

A narrow road connects the beach to the ECR. The development of this as a tourist attraction has considerable potential for improvement. Although the beach has beautiful views, it needs to be cleaned. Walking on the beach is challenging.\n\nPlenty of scope for improvement if this is to be developed as a tourist attraction.\n\nBeautiful! Peaceful! Serene! After our visit to Auroville, we traveled for about 8 KM and reached Paradise Beach. Not that crowded. It's relatively clean. Had rock hills to climb up & sit. Loved it!",
