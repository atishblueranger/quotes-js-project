And the worst thing is, i paid for it with my own will. Is that how middle classes should be punished? The composer is also a genuis in a way that he somehow found out the most abhorrent notes those instruments can play.\n\nAlso you need to pay for the program brochure.

I went to the top of the tower, the staircase is really narrow steep and long so be prepared for a bit of a hike but once you are at the top it's a full 360° view of the city. The price was quite reasonable I believe it was €5 per person but I could be mistaken. 10/10 if in Frankfurt this is a great place to go. There's also lots of historical buildings in the vicinity including places to eat or grab coffee. Great place to spend an afternoon.",

With its cylindrical shape and diamond-patterned glass façade, it stands out beautifully against the skyline and adds a modern touch to the historic city.\n\nLocated along the Main River, it's a great place to enjoy a scenic walk or a riverside coffee. The area around the tower is clean, well-developed, and quieter than the city center, making it a perfect spot for a relaxed stroll or some peaceful time by the water.\n\nWhile the building is mostly used for offices and isn't open to tourists inside, it's still a must-see from the outside for fans of contemporary architecture. At sunset, the way the glass reflects the changing sky is truly stunning - great for photography!\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that public access is limited, and it would be amazing if there were an observation deck or café open to the public inside the tower.\n\nTip: Walk a bit along the riverbank to capture the full tower with the Main River in the foreground - perfect photo op!\n\n4/5 – A modern architectural gem by the river.

After being damaged in World War II, the house was restored to as close as possible to what it looked like earlier when Goethe lived here, and also there is a museum attached to it, in case you want to know more about Johann Wolfgang von Goethe’s life and work.",
