It connects the Neckar River to Neuenheim Old Town and is made of classic red sandstone. The bridge leads to the romantic ruins of an old castle that once served as a heavily fortified Gothic stronghold and later as one of Germany's most magnificent residences. Unfortunately, much of the structure was destroyed during wars in the 17th century and never rebuilt.",

The thought, symbolism and skill putting this great piece of art left me stunned. I am so grateful to have visited this Church and would love to see such exhibitions again.\n\nThe altar and the orgel are also incredibly beautiful.

I went to a Jesuit college myself so I have been in and around many Jesuit buildings and this is one of the prettier ones that I've ever seen. It's very unique in that the inside is all alabaster white and really feels like you are in the clouds. It's quite large on the inside, but not nearly as large as some other ones that you will see in Italy or in Cologne. There was no entry fee, and there were only a few other people inside all of which were there for prayer. We saw one other tourist couple entering as we were exiting so it's a very quiet and serene place to check out. It's right in the middle of old town so it's an easy walk to all the historical sites of Heidelberg. I would honestly recommend for anyone to visit, especially if you are catholic.",
