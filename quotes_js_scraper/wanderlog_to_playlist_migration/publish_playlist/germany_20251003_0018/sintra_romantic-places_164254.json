We absolutely loved this place!\nI wouldn't hesitate to go back to this stunning place again and again if I were to return to Portugal. I would call this place “Fairytale Land” it had beautiful architecture everywhere, fairytale towers that you could climb up via spiral staircases, manicured gardens, woodland walks, out of this world initiation wells and an abundance of underground caves! Once you are inside, the place is so vast, you could not possibly get bored. The initiation well was absolutely awesome which led you to the first series of underground caves. It was just one splendour after another. Then when you thought you had seen most things you would stumble upon another underground caves network (without lighting) so the torch on your phone will come in handy! Honestly I think this is one of the loveliest places we have been to. I was excited to be there and the beauty and splendour of this place was simply jaw dropping!\nThe queue system wasn't so great mind. Definitely book a ticket in advance. Then go to the front of the queue- as there seemed to be two queues- one for the current time slot - then a second queue for later time slots. To get in you have to go to the front queue (which tends to be quite short) . However the second queue will just leave you getting nowhere fast!",

The interior also does not disappoint because the rooms are magical. The staff is highly organized a d helpful.\n\nPlease bare in mind to buy tickets in advance and always I mean always arrive at the time you selected when buying the tickets, otherwise you will wait hours because they don't let you go inside any time earlier. They are very strict with the timing. I can't blame them because there are hundreds of people waiting to get inside at any hour.\n\nOverall it was a very nice experience, one of the top 5 from Lisbon and surroundings.",

There was no queue when we arrived and I would recommend (if you're staying in Lisbon) to get an uber from Lisbon to Palace of Pena and then walk back down because once you've made a trek up then then you have the rest of the park to visit which is quite large!

No times slots booking needed. Hop on and hop off buses run until 18:30, park clothes at 19:00. Make sure you can spend 2-3 hours here as the area is huge and the hill on the way back are steep. But it is so much worth your visit, I promise!!",

This medieval-style pub is the perfect refuge on a chilly evening, offering a warm, welcoming atmosphere that feels like stepping into another time. The crackling fireplace, rustic decor, and soft medieval melodies create an unmatched vibe-cozy, mysterious, and deeply comforting.\n\nThe food is simple but fantastic. Their toasties are perfectly crisp and satisfying, making them the ideal companion to a cold night. But the real highlights here are the drinks-a rich selection of teas to warm the soul and mead that transports you straight into a medieval feast. The mead is smooth, slightly sweet, and dangerously easy to sip.\n\nBeyond the food and ambiance, the people make this place truly special. The staff are welcoming, passionate, and full of great recommendations, adding to the sense of being a guest in a magical hidden tavern. Whether you're stopping by after exploring Sintra's mystical landscapes or seeking an atmospheric escape, Casa do Fauno is an unforgettable experience-a must-visit for lovers of history, comfort, and a truly unique night out.",

The trek itself was delightful, winding through towering trees adorned with lichens that added a touch of timeless beauty. The crisp, fresh air invigorated every step, and the soothing sounds of small waterfalls cascading down the rocks created a serene soundtrack to the journey.\n\nAs you ascend, the lush greenery envelopes you, offering pockets of shade and moments to pause and appreciate nature's magnificence. Reaching the top feels like a reward, with sweeping, panoramic views of the entire city sprawling beneath you.

My husband had the picanha and it was very thin pieces of meat and not much flavour.\nThe last disappointing thing was the wine, we ordered the green wine on tap and there was something floating in the bottom of the jar. My husband was totally disgusted by that and it ruined his whole meal.\nFor the prices we paid, I would have expected better quality and some live music would have been nice.",

Despite being abandoned since the 1830s, wandering through its ruins still exudes an atmosphere of peace and tranquility.",
