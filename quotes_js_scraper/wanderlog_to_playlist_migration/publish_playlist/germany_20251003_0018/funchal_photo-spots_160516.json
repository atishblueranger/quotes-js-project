It's only €3 to get in (per person) but note that to use the restrooms is another 50c per person. There is a good cafe and gift shop on site too. There is limited parking however so whilst there are a few car parks they are small and this is a popular location so I advise visiting either early or late afternoon if you can. The views are simply remarkable. The height is immense and the views are something you cannot really capture on a photo, it's something you need to experience. Highly recommend checking this out when on the island.",

You could easily spend a whole day enjoying the sights, grabbing a coffee at the café ☕, and visiting nearby attractions 🏞️.\n\n🛗 The ride itself takes about 10 minutes. The cable cars were clean and spacious very comfortable!\n\n✅ Definitely recommend adding this to your itinerary while visiting the island! 🌴✨",

The vibe is very relaxed - it's basically one big room, perfect for a 30-minute visit.

It's a beautiful spot with a nice, peaceful atmosphere. The best part is that it's free to visit and open 24/7. There's a set of steps leading downhill to the base of the statue, and walking down felt really nice. You also get stunning panoramic views of the cliffs and the ocean as you go down, which makes the experience even better. The view looking up at the statue from below is also pretty impressive. They have cable cars that take you down to the beach for 5 euros per person, but we didn't try them. Overall, it was a really nice experience and definitely worth a visit if you're in the area.",
