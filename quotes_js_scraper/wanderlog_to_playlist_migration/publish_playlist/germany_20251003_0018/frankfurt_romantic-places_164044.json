I ordered still water, the hummus and a mixed platter. The mixed platter came out shortly and was good although I was expecting the hummus appetizer first. The server apologized and brought it out. I was surprised that it was cold hummus...it tasted like store bought with oil poured on top with cold flat bread despite the nice presentation. I had a couple of bites and took the rest to go. I was surprised to be charged for it despite getting it after my main meal. Overall, it was a fun vibe inside but wasn't very impressed with the service and the food was OK.

The rink was large enough, and the quality of the ice was great, making it enjoyable to skate. It was also a nice touch to have both indoor and outdoor rinks, which added variety to the experience.\n\nHowever, the organization for rental shoes could definitely be improved-it felt a bit chaotic and could be more efficient. On the positive side, having a restaurant on-site was a great convenience, but the toilets were not clean, which was disappointing and needs attention.\n\nOverall, a decent experience with some areas for improvement",

Up to 7 courses are available. Super quality and fantastic looks. Good wine menu.\n\nIt's very nice to see the work in the kitchen while eating. Very professional very calm and yet busy because the restaurant was fully booked.\n\nBe aware that it could be quite noisy. We sat between two quite extroverted tables of four which did not allow for any romantic whispering 🙂\nHaving said that it was a brilliant evening and a great dining experience.",

Seated at 7:35 PM, our 7-course menu with wine pairings started strong-the amuse bouche and drinks came out quickly. But things slowed drastically. By 9 PM, we had only reached the third course. Dinner didn't end until 10:30. It felt like we were being held hostage by the pacing.\n\nThe restaurant is tiny (about 600 sq ft), with 14 tables, 3 wait staff, and 3 chefs working in a kitchen smaller than most home kitchens. The executive chef didn't start cooking until 8:30 PM. Our pacing seemed intentionally slowed to sync with later tables. One table next to us was seated at 7 PM and had to wait over an hour just to align with others.\n\nDishes were repetitive-same sauces, same pickled elements, reused vegetables. My wife's vegetarian course was just a mix of leftover garnish components. Honestly, the wine pairings were the only standout.\n\nFor the price, Bidlabu should reduce the table count and focus on service flow and a more thoughtful menu. There's talent here-but it's being smothered by logistical limitations.",

From the situation I felt that it was complimentary, but actually they charged it in the cheque. Something to keep in mind.\n\n- overall the folks there were very helpful, but I felt that one server was a little unwelcoming, and made me wonder whether it was because of our race, since there was no other conceivable reason to warrant the cold attitude. However it's a very good chance that it's just the personality, and so while I'm not making accusations, it definitely dampened our experience. We spent >1000 euro for a 3 person dinner.",
