You will fond very nice tiny golfs where you can swim between the rocks.\n\nI strongly recommend this beach!",

We'll definitely come back here!\n\nWARNING: When swimming, be mindful of the rocks in the water! Double-check before diving in.\n\nOnly con: The water didn't seem the cleanest. There was heaps of random bits in it - I can't fully describe what all the stuff was. We still had a great time swimming, but it did feel a tad gross with different things floating about.\n\nHowever, we'd happily visit again! ☺️\n\nALSO! We HIGHLY recommend buying a pina colada from this stall on the street, before you go down the steps to the beach. You're served a whole pineapple with the tastiest pina colada freshly made in the pineapple. Once you have purchased a pineapple you can go back for refills for €5 per pineapple drink.

            "text": "This is a small sandy beach with a lovely pier for jumping into the sea and a natural rock pool nearby. It has a shower to rinse off the salt after swimming, which is a big plus. However, there's no toilet available to the public and no comfortable spot to change clothes, so keep that in mind.\n\nOn weekends, you'll likely find a spot, but expect to lie close to others-think sardines in a can. The beach is quite compact.\n\nOne important note: tides matter a lot here. The beach is partly rocky, and the natural pool area gets completely submerged at high tide. Be careful if you plan to swim there-conditions can change quickly. I highly recommend checking the tide forecasts before your visit.\n\nI've been using the app Nautide: Marés, Vendas, Ondes + for years, or you can use the website prilivy. For example, today's tide table shows a peak tide of 4.1 meters at 6:10 PM. That means the waves will be highest and most of the beach will be underwater around that time.\n\nIf you're heading to smaller beaches, try to plan your visit during low tide, when the coefficient is lowest-it makes a huge difference. I'm attaching a photo showing how completely the rocky part was flooded yesterday.",

I am attaching real photos here. There is a huge problem with fungi and mould in this house, giant spiders, ants, stench, renovation never completed, everything left halfway and not finished as the landlord suffers from mental illness borderline bipolar malignant narcissism personality disorder. He is extremely dangerous and nasty !\n\nAlso, electrical installation is broken, as is the toilet (flushes upwards ! ), shower, internet keep turning off due to a short circuit in the installation (owner wants to save even more money on a circuit that is not adapted to the building), so not even basic health and safety compliance.\n\nFurthermore, enormous stress and constant discomfort due to grandiose malignant narcissistic entitled landlord, he isn't real Portuguese, he won't even welcome you with a tiny smile when you arrive. He will meet you with angry face at the doors as if he is making you favour that you pay him. He keeps entering and checking the house obsessively and watches the tenants, he has problems with anger control, has outbursts of aggression. Very unstable male, literally the most extreme psychosis entitlement I have seen so far.\n\nThere is no end to the problems, broken door handles, mold settles even on your private clothes in the wardrobe. Don't go to such small towns, people are backwards there, rent in Lisbon only, or Algarve only.",

First, the hotel's location on the beach is stunning. The Dom Carlos room has enormous windows that provided our guests the most wonderful, beautiful view. We worked with Marta, who we cannot recommend highly enough. She worked incredibly diligently to ensure every detail of our event went smoothly. She helped us coordinate rental furniture and flower arrangement delivery. She was professional, responsive to emails, and genuine. We felt very supported and heard by her and her team.\n\nThe welcome party was perfect. We cannot say enough amazing things about the FOOD. Everyone loved it. Nobody was bored. The bartenders were professional and quick to make sure people had a drink. We were able to choose several signature cocktails which our guests loved. If you are getting married in or around Cascais we highly recommend the Hotel Albatroz as a potential rehearsal dinner / welcome party space!!",

You're right on the water with easy access to the center of Cascais. The restaurant is exceptional. Easily one of the best meals I've had in the area. Service was excellent throughout, very attentive without being overbearing.\n\nA couple of things could be better. The corridors aren't well soundproofed. You can hear people talking like they're standing inside your room, at least on the floor we were on. Also, the water in the bathrooms gets way too hot, to the point of being uncomfortable.\n\nStill, it's a solid hotel. I'd come back, but I'd book a quieter room.
