A very thin strip of sand, also fine, which gives the impression of a cove, without really being one, because if the walk is blocked towards Olhos d'Agua you can reach the other beaches of Falesia by following the shoreline.",

Access is fairly easy if you're fit – there are a few stairs and a slight incline, so it might be a bit tricky for elderly visitors who aren't steady on their feet. But for younger people or anyone in good shape, it's no problem at all.\n\nThere's also a small beach bar/restaurant where you can grab drinks, ice cream, or even have lunch, which is a nice bonus.\n\nWe had a really lovely day here. The only downside is that the rock formations surrounding the beach create a sort of natural tunnel, which blocks a lot of the breeze. On very hot days, the heat can build up and feel a bit intense.\n\nOverall, a great spot for a relaxed beach day.",

Service initially was very quick to take drink orders and come out but shit the food was slow, 2 tables sat down way after us got ate and left before we had ours. Just for fried fish? One of the other tables even ordered the same dish as us and got it before. Waited 40 minutes we asked. Come asked food promptly came out. Not one to make a fuss, everyone was super nice and having worked in the industry for along time I understand these things happen!\nSangria (red):\nCalamari: this was very good, thick batter with a very  egg fresh and tasty calamari. The garlic and herb mayo was incredible, strong garlic flavours super smooth mayo. Perfect combination with the calamari!\nShrimp risotto:\nMeat and chroizo skewer: meat was well cooked, tender pink in the middle and full of flavour. I personally love roasted veg and these were nicely done",

The 19,50€ Caesar salad looked and tasted like it has been directly store bought and plated. Even the shrimps weren't even that fresh. When we first got there not only it took them 40 minutes to give us a table, they also actively ignored our table. After a while when the server finally came we ordered a bottle of water with four glasses. The water came 30min later after we had already finished our meals. Even after calling over different servers, it took them this long to bring over a single bottle of water. If I could put 0 starts I would. The view of the beach is not worth this bad of an experience. Tourists, please don't do the same mistake I did prices are not supposed to be that high whatsoever. Thank you for your time",
