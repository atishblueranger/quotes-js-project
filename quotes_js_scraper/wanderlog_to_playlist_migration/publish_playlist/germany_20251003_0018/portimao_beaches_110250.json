Prices for loungers range from 13 to 17 euros, depending on the time of day.\n\nTo the left of the beach, the shopping area features many tourist traps and less-than-ideal dining options. It's only worth visiting for its elevated views of the beach and surrounding area. The Atlantic Ocean water is quite cold - some may find it too icy to swim comfortably. Ultimately, whether it's tolerable depends on personal preference.\n\nThere are limited activities on the beach aside from sunbathing and relaxing. Although I'm not typically a beach lover, I enjoyed resting on the loungers. The beachside restaurants and bars that mainly serve lunch offer the best food and drinks. It's a nice place to unwind, but it's helpful to have some knowledge of where to go to fully enjoy the experience.",
