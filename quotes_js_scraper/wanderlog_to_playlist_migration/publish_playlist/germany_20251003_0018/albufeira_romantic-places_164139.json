Well organised. Left dead on time. Recommend you park in the underground car park at marina (ignore the local reviews about the free local car park just outside the old town its a scam as it costs £10 from there by tuk tuk/taxi to the marina and is 35 minute walk away).\nNot for the faint hearted, really bumpy and windy which we loved!  Toilet on board. Saw coastline first, then could have stopped for a really quick swim (too windy!) Then we went dolphin hunting and were not disappointed!!!!! Next we went to the caves which were outstanding!\nOn the way back the mini bar was open.\nBumpy, exhilarating ride back after a few local landmarks pointed out.\nPs avoid wearing hats....\nHighly recommend.\nYou also get discount off photos, lunch in nearly restaurants.  Go for it but book as gets full quickly.",

We did this trip last year and didn't see any kids were a bit disappointed but understood. Staff are amazing with plenty of knowledge and took time to explain to everyone in a variety of languages a big shout to Matilde she was brilliant on our trip and her knowledge of languages and abilities to change and crack jokes with all was credit to her. I would highly recommend the tour the insomnia is a smaller boat and goes fast which was a lot of fun and goes into the caves for breathtaking views. Sorry no pictures of the dolphins they were all videos and I can't upload here",

With only 12 tables, it's essential to make reservations in advance. If possible, opt for a window table to enjoy picturesque views. The restaurant offers a three-course set menu featuring seasonal ingredients. While the ambiance and setting are remarkable, some guests have noted issues with temperature consistency for their dishes and found the wine pairing to be overpriced.",

It's a set menu and they cater for vegetarian options (and vegan). I'd say it's better to let them know ahead if vegan, but vegetarian is on the menu.\n\nWe paid €77 per head for the set menu. The food was delicious and we left happy having found this place last minute.\n\nWell done!",

She will always greet you pleasantly, lift your spirits and serve you at the highest level!\nThe menu has a good selection, from the starters I definitely recommend trying the shrimp cream soup. From the main dishes there was an opportunity to try pasta with seafood, risotto, grilled fish and shrimp. And absolutely everything was divine! They also have a children's menu.

For the mains I had the Sole Meuniêre with chips. My wife had the Beef Wellington. My fish was light, flaky and very tasty. My wife's Beef Wellington had light puff pastry and huge chunks of beef in a rich gravy. Delicious. For desert we both had the homemade cheesecake. Again. Delicious. This is restaurant you must try.

This beach is no where near as nice as Praia de Felisia which is only 10 min drive away.\nThe beach here is very small and really crowded. And comparing this beach with others I was quite amazed that there was so many empty bottles and litter amongst the sand which could be a real hazard for kids.\nOne good thing is that there is plenty of sea shells if you like to pick them and you will have a wider variety of food outlets here.",

Hundreds of them are locked wherever you move. Hence there were countless empty bottles and cans along the beach. The only good thing I find is waiters walking around the sunbeds and taking orders for drinks and food so on hot days you don't have to move. Sand a bit rougher with millions of broken shells. When you enter the ocean you have to be careful as they're everywhere . Not impressed anyway, there are hundreds of nicer beaches in Portugal.",

First off, the atmosphere was absolutely top-notch-dim lighting, cozy yet classy decor, and a lively but not overwhelming vibe. Perfect place for a date night or drinks with friends.\n\nSpeaking of drinks, the cocktail menu was stellar. Creative, well-balanced, and the bartender clearly knows what they're doing. I'd honestly come back just for the drinks alone.\n\nNow, onto the reason we came: the steaks. Unfortunately, this is where things fell short. Both mine and my partner's steaks arrived noticeably cold-not just lukewarm, but like they'd been sitting for a while before hitting the table. Flavor-wise, they had potential, but it was hard to enjoy them with the temperature so off. We did mention it to our server, who was friendly and apologetic, but it definitely put a damper on the meal.\n\nOverall, I'd rate the atmosphere and drinks a solid 5 stars. The food? Maybe a 2. If they can get the kitchen timing sorted out, this place could be a real winner.",
