Beautiful grounds and surrounding areas saying that. Well worth a visit if you're in the area, even if it's still wrapped up. The grounds are well maintained. They have a few eateries and amenities in the area too. This area can be very busy, as the Belém Tower is one of the highlights of Lisbon. No idea when it will reopen and prices.

I ended up buying two tickets by mistake when I only needed one.

The panoramic views of Lisbon are breathtaking-you can see the entire city stretched out below, just as pictured. The charming fountain area offers plenty of seating, making it a perfect spot to relax with coffee or even enjoy a leisurely lunch. With ample benches and easy access via Tram 51E or local buses, this miradouro is both convenient and unforgettable. A must-visit for the views, vibes, and vibrant local culture!",

It was so worth the price and the seafood were all so fresh.\n\nWe got their Barnacles, their snow crab with sauce, Carabineiro, clams, scampi, and their prego. The Barnacles was nice and briny, similiar to clams or mussels. The steamed scampi was overcooked until almost shredded. But the real show was really the crab. The crab was filled with fresh meat. We love the way they made the crab sauce with the crab head, and it was the perfect dipping sauce.\n\nThe vibe at the restaurant was fun and relaxed, and the staff were friendly. Definitely a spot I'd come back to whenever I'm in town. Highly recommend if you love good seafood!\n\nIf you want to come here, definitely make a reservation because this spot gets packed and your 25€ deposit is applied to your bill in the end too!\n\n10/10 would recommend this spot if you love fresh and delicious seafood!",

Fresh and bouncy shrimp meat.\nThe edible crab is also amazing. Rich in flavor and has huge claws.\nThe bread with butter is crispy outside and soft in the middle. It tastes even better with the sauce from the food.\nThe clams and scallops are great as well.\nThe service is good, and the atmosphere is good. Highly recommend.",

Tucked right next to Praça do Comércio, it's a peaceful riverside spot with amazing views of the Tagus-especially at sunset. Whether you're passing through or looking for a place to unwind, this is a perfect stop.\n\nThe vibe here is really special. It's calm but still full of life-locals lounging around, tourists soaking it all in, occasional street performers, and sometimes even live music playing in the background. It feels like a snapshot of Lisbon's soul.\n\nI love grabbing a coffee and just sitting on the stone steps, watching boats go by and the sky change colors as the city lights start to glow. It's also a great spot for photos-between the water reflections and the beautiful architecture, everything looks picture-perfect.\n\nIt's simple, free, and yet one of the most memorable parts of the city. I've been here multiple times and always end up staying longer than I planned.\n\nIf you're visiting Lisbon, definitely carve out a little time to come here. You won't regret it.",

I enjoyed the new perspectives that this museum has to offer, and a look into the energy exhibit. Some of the art was hard to comprehend, but after reading the captions it started to make sense.\n\nI think the point of this museum is to make you think hard-about humanity and the world in general. It's worth a visit.\n\nWe went up on the roof and the views were stunning. There's a great view of the bridge, and the surrounding water.\n\nWould recommend!",

The last part of the energy was interesting but  that couldn't make up for the large displacement the rest of this was.\n\nThe plus side for the place was the exterior of the building. Amazing architecture and a beautiful patio with a view.\n\nGo check out the interior but save your money on the inside.",

Not expertly crafted cocktails. Rather traditional classics.\nThe big downside was service. Random, inexperienced young people. They didn't have any customer service skills or knowledge, so unless you don't know yourself what you like I wouldn't recommend. Quite shocked us when one of the waitresses spilled whole entire tray of drinks straight onto young foreign customers sitting by one of the tables next to us! What kind of service is it?",

V reasonably priced drinks overall.\nThe place got quite busy post 11.\n\nOh and make sure to go down to the loo ;) it has a vibe and character of it's own - which adds to the overall experience\n\nI wasn't aware of the \"rules\" of the bar as such (walked in with a waterbottle in my hand ) ; but the way the staff handled it and explained it to me was extremely professional and yet v friendly.\n\nThey don't have any food, but the staff was kind enough to suggest a brilliant burger joint closeby.\n\nHighly recommend a visit if in Lisbon.",

Watching the sunset from this vantage point is truly magical and makes the visit worth it on its own.\n\nThe bar itself is modern, chic, and elegant, with a relaxed yet sophisticated vibe. It's designed to let the views shine, with floor-to-ceiling windows that make you feel as if you're floating above the city.\n\nThe drinks menu is excellent, offering a wide selection of cocktails, wines, and spirits. The cocktails are creative, well-balanced, and beautifully presented, perfectly matching the high-end feel of the venue. Prices are naturally a bit higher than average for Lisbon, but considering the location and experience, they feel justified.\n\nThe service is professional and attentive, with staff who are friendly and quick to offer recommendations. You never feel rushed, and the overall pace of the evening allows you to fully enjoy the atmosphere.\n\nWhether you're looking for a romantic evening, a special occasion spot, or simply one of the best views in Lisbon, Babylon 360 delivers. It's not just a bar, it's an experience that combines stunning scenery, quality drinks, and excellent service.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone visiting Lisbon who wants to enjoy the city from a whole new perspective.",

What stood out most was the integration of contemporary artistic collaborations, which breathe new life into the space without overshadowing its historical weight.\n\nThe structure itself is elegant and serene, and the modern touches serve as a powerful reminder of how history and memory continue to evolve. It's a quiet, reflective place-less grandiose, but deeply intentional in its presentation.\n\nA meaningful stop for those who appreciate heritage spaces that honour the past while embracing the present.",

I recommend booking around 21:00 as people will start to leave and the restaurant will get more quiet.

The music was a bit funky for my taste but it is a matter of preference and others might actually like it. The dining room is tastefully designed and the staff are knowledgeable about the dishes and attentive. High recommendation, keep on the good work",

It is one of the rare fine dining restaurants that I have visited and I have thought I'll revisit if I ever get the chance. I think the only weak points were the bread and the cheese platter, for my taste. They were quality products but they were not that great, relative to the other dishes. The bread was something I can easily make (One of my evaluation criteria is always whether I can make a similar food or not). Cheese platters have never been my favorites. This one wasn't an exception neither. It had some nice elements but I think they should always be optional at an additional cost.",
