After you hand in the numbered chip at the return, a total price will be calculated and deducted from the 25 you paid down. You get your change in cash.\n\n⭐Our 60-min boating of a two seater costs 12 euro. Another two seater at 74 minutes costs 14.80 euro.\n\n⭐Four seaters are in shorter supply and higher demand, so the wait is longer. It's always a good idea to get in the line early.

It's ideal for sunbathing and enjoying a break, with kids playing around and a very laid-back atmosphere. While it's not meant for swimming, it's great for grilling, picnicking, or just soaking up the sun. There's no restaurant on-site, so bringing your own food and drinks is a must - but that actually adds to the cozy, picnic vibe. It's surprisingly close to the city, yet feels wonderfully quiet and remote. If you're on a bike tour, it's an absolutely perfect rest stop. Highly recommended for anyone looking to unwind by the water!",
