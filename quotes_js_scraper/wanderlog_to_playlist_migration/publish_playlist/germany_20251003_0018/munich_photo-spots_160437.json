It’s just too classically Munich to pass up: in the center of the wonderful Viktualienmarkt—Munich’s excellent year-round open-air farmer’s market—is a large Maibaum, or Maypole, a common sight around Bavaria; but this Maypole is particularly large and attractive and is the perfect meeting point in the center of town. (By the way, traditionally Maypoles can be stolen by rival towns, and the successful thieves must have a party thrown for them in order to get their Maypole back.) Grab a fresh juice or cup of coffee from one of the nearby stands, or perhaps a wurst or a giant pickle, get in front of the Maypole (if it hasn’t been stolen!) and strike a pose.",

Up close, the Late Gothic brickwork feels fortress-like, but step inside and it shifts: the soaring white interior, with its slender columns and ribbed vaults, feels almost weightless. Light filters through stained glass that miraculously survived the bombing of World War II, giving the space a quiet dignity.\n\nWhat surprised me most, though, wasn't the grandeur but the details: the “Devil's Footprint” in the floor, linked to a centuries-old legend, and the striking tomb of Emperor Ludwig IV (who died in 1347), guarded by bronze knights. It's these little touches that make the cathedral more than just an architectural icon, it's a place layered with stories, power, and myth. Standing there, you feel both the scale of Bavarian history and the human quirks that keep it alive.",

The towering Propyläen leads into a square flanked by the Glyptothek and the Staatliche Antikensammlungen, all echoing King Ludwig I's vision of an “Isar-Athens.” A place rich with historical layers-from art and architecture to Nazi propaganda and modern cultural resurgence. Today, it hosts concerts and quiet moments alike and sits proudly at the heart of Munich's museum district. Easily reached via U-Bahn (U2/U8). #Munich #Konigsplatz #Neoclassical #CulturalLandmark",

We'd booked the guided tour in advance, which started promptly with a lovely tour guide who was friendly, engaging, and brilliant with our children (age 9). The tour lasted just over an hour and covered the majority of the museum, with plenty of fascinating facts about the exhibits. I highly recommend booking the tour – you get fast-track access, headsets for clear audio throughout, and the chance to see under the bonnet of some of the cars.\n\nOn arrival, remember to store your belongings in the lockers downstairs. We had a quick stop in the museum café – the selection was fine but limited – and a browse through the small gift shop. Overall, it was a great experience for the whole family.",

I own and frequently ride a BMW touring motorcycle and had heard great things about the museum from a friend.  It did not disappoint!  I learned about the history of the company…of which I only knew a fraction.  Cars, motorcycles, boats, and aircraft were all on display.\n\nA lot of thought went into the design and the tour was quite pleasant.  We opted for the self-guided tour at our own pace.  They also offer a guided tour in English as well.  Those on the guided tour were treated to additional insights…I lingered just long enough to capture a few glimpses.\n\nThey've got a cafe with tasty drinks and treats too.\n\nOverall, a good value for the price and definitely worth the time…about 2.5 hours inside.",

Tower tickets can be purchased at the base of the tower as walk-up only (no reservations accepted unless you want a night tour).\n\nKeep in mind there are 306 steps to the top of the tower, but the view is worth the climb. On your way up, you can see the massive bells. At the top, you get wonderful views of Marienplatz and all of Old Town. The church nave itself features ornate decoration with accents of pink and gold on white, making it a peaceful space of reflection. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in architecture, history, or great city views.",

Wilhelm renounced the splendours of court life at an early stage, devoted himself to religious meditation and in 1598 finally abdicated in favour of his energetic son Maximilian. The founding of Schleißheim reflected his personal inclination towards pious contemplation.\n\nIn the period from 1598 to 1600 Wilhelm had an estate and a manor built within the complex, which was surrounded by small hermitages and forest chapels. The duke, who had no intention of altering the character of the property as a farm, extended its activities with a stud farm which supplied his stables. Schleißheim beer and Schleißheim cheese were produced. Attracted in particular by the profits from the farming business, Maximilian I (reigned 1598-1651) acquired the complex from his father in 1616 in return for a life annuity The Schleißheim park was designed in strict alignment with Lustheim and the New Palace and is one of the most important baroque gardens in Europe.\n\nIt was initially influenced by Dutch garden design, and subsequently extended by the French garden expert and waterworks engineer Dominique Gerard in the French baroque garden style. With his embroidered parterres, pools, fountains and cascades he created a unique design, the basic features of which have remained unchanged.\n\nThe ensemble consisting of the New and Old Palaces, Lustheim Palace and the extensive baroque garden is a splendid example of court architecture and garden design from the 17th and 18th centuries.",

The inner courtyard is open to the public and features a restaurant and public restrooms. Guided tours of the inside are available. I was allowed to free roam inside, but I think that might only happen in May. There is also an observation deck at the top of the tower.

The 85-meter tower is home to the famous Glockenspiel, which still draws crowds daily to watch figures reenact 16th-century Bavarian stories.\n\nThe exterior is packed with statues, floral balconies, and spires that look medieval but are purely 19th-century romanticism. Inside, the building still houses the city government, but visitors can ride the elevator up the tower for sweeping views across Munich.\n\nDuring WWII, much of the city center was destroyed, yet the Neues Rathaus was repaired and restored, preserving its role as a backdrop for everything from Christmas markets to championship celebrations for FC Bayern.",

Offering a peaceful and stylish environment, it's a great spot to relax, grab a coffee, and reflect on the art you've seen. The café has a welcoming vibe and is a nice contrast to the bustling energy of the galleries.\n\nOverall, Pinakothek der Moderne is a must-visit for anyone interested in modern art.

            "text": "Really great museum in Munich, and it was an enjoyable experience. The museum was expansive, featuring a diverse range of fascinating displays that catered to various interests. Depending on your preferences, there was something to captivate everyone.\n\nThe museum's size means that it takes several hours to explore fully, but it is definitely worth the time. I particularly enjoyed the bottom floor, which showcased a captivating mix of modern and antique furniture designs. Meanwhile, the upper floors offered an array of art displays that were equally delightful.\n\nThe venue itself is picturesque, with the building's architecture adding to the overall experience. This museum in Munich is a must-visit for anyone in the area.\n\nMoreover, the entry fee is quite reasonable. At just €12, visitors gain access to all three museums in the vicinity, making it an excellent value for money.\n\nOverall, I would highly recommend this museum to anyone.",
