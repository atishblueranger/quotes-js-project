I ended up buying two tickets by mistake when I only needed one.

Located directly across from the grand Basílica da Estrela, this romantic-style park was inaugurated in 1852 and offers a refreshing blend of history, nature, and community life. The park spans 4.6 hectares and features winding paths shaded by exotic trees like jacarandas and ginkgoes, as well as beautifully maintained flower beds and small lakes with ducks and turtles. One of the standout features is the wrought-iron bandstand, originally built in 1884 and relocated here in 1936, which adds a touch of old-world charm. Families and locals gather here, especially on weekends, to enjoy the playgrounds, picnic areas, and the café with outdoor seating that serves light meals and drinks. The park is free to enter and open daily from 7 am to midnight, making it an accessible and welcoming space for everyone. Whether you're looking to relax, take a leisurely stroll, or immerse yourself in a bit of Lisbon's history, Jardim da Estrela offers a serene and delightful escape from the city's hustle and bustle.",

I enjoyed the new perspectives that this museum has to offer, and a look into the energy exhibit. Some of the art was hard to comprehend, but after reading the captions it started to make sense.\n\nI think the point of this museum is to make you think hard-about humanity and the world in general. It's worth a visit.\n\nWe went up on the roof and the views were stunning. There's a great view of the bridge, and the surrounding water.\n\nWould recommend!",

It didn't really grab me and the other was an energy building that also had a very disturbing art exhibit. The last part of the energy was interesting but  that couldn't make up for the large displacement the rest of this was.\n\nThe plus side for the place was the exterior of the building. Amazing architecture and a beautiful patio with a view.\n\nGo check out the interior but save your money on the inside.",

Whether you're looking for a fun night out with friends, live music, or just people-watching with a drink in hand, Pink Street delivers. It's lively without losing its charm, and the pink-painted cobblestones give it a unique character that makes it stand out from other nightlife areas.
