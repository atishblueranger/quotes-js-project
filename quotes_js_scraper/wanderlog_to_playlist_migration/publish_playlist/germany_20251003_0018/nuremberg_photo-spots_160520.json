On the occasion of a choir trip to Nuremberg, #Littlefeet and its choir were able to give a small concert in the Sebalduskirche or St. Sebaldkirche during a prayer service together with the Nuremberg Youth Choir.\n\nReally impressive!\n\nThis church is a masterpiece! We were even allowed into the choir of angels and the choir sang the Our Father high up there, so that the visitors down in the nave turned around in amazement and delight ...\n\nBefore the choir sang a few songs in the nave in front of the altar, we were able to experience the impressive organ. And for those who missed it: Outside next to the entrance is a plaque stating that Johann Pachelbel worked here as an organist from 1695 to 1706.\n\nIt was a wonderful time in one of the most beautiful churches in Bavaria. The wonderfully painted windows, the altar and the tomb of St. Sebald in particular impress even people who have nothing to do with church culture or the Christian faith.\n\nThanks for this wonderful experience to everyone who made it possible. Thumbs up!",

The twin spires dominate the skyline, but it's the details that stay with you: Romanesque roots blending seamlessly with soaring Gothic architecture, the intricate stone carvings over the portals, and the rich play of light through centuries-old stained glass.\n\nInside, the space is breathtaking. The high vaulted ceilings lift your eyes upward, while the elaborate tomb of St. Sebald, crafted in dark bronze with remarkable detail, anchors the interior with reverence. Each chapel holds its own story, from altarpieces to frescoes, giving you a sense of both faith and history woven together.\n\nWhat struck me most was the atmosphere; it feels both grand and intimate, a living part of Nuremberg's heritage rather than just a monument. This is a place to linger, to take in the artistry, and to appreciate how much care and devotion went into creating and preserving it over the centuries.",

The museum spoke for itself, containing not only artistic treasures from Nuremberg's past but the house itself, being one of the only similar mansions to survive the wartime bombing, displayed all manner of ancient and clever German craftsmanship.  Indeed, the Fembo mansion is the most important artifact of the museum in my opinion.  The museum also does a great job of showing before, during, and after photographs of the wartime bombing.  The museum is centrally located, easy to find, and affords wonderful views of the city as it is on a hill near the fortress.  We hit the museum before we did anything else in Nuremberg, and it turned out to be a great strategy as our visit to the museum gave us a whole other level of understanding the city as we explored it.  Friends and my own research had alerted me to the quality of this museum, and I can confirm that even the most jaded of my party agreed that it was a highlight of our trip.",

There are also two faithfully carved models from middle ages Nuremberg... Descending the ornately carved wooden staircase brings you to a veritable managerie of Nuremberg artwork , prints , weapons and unique curios with the tour finally ending  at the groundfloor exhibit of graffic , confronting photographs of heavily bombed Nuremberg in 1945...A visit to the Stadtsmuseum is certainly a multifaceted sojourn into the fascinating and tumultuous history of one of Germany's grandest old cities.",

Although there is a qr code that you can scan at the meeting point (on a small plaque on the wall of the old city hall, very inconspicuous), each tour is limited to 20 people so advance booking is still the best option. There is only one English guided tour at 18.00. If you end up in a German guided tour and don't understand much German, tell your guide at the beginning - - they will give you an audio guide. It doesn't give as much as information as the guide themselves, but at least you won't be completely lost.\nThe tour takes about 50 minutes during which one goes through a series of dungeon chambers with the guide.

Built in the late 13th century, it was both a symbol of imperial authority and a defensive watchtower. Climbing the narrow wooden spiral staircase is an experience in itself, and once at the top, the reward is a sweeping 360° view across the city's rooftops, churches, and beyond to the Franconian countryside. From here, the scale of Nuremberg truly comes into focus. Inside, displays include historic drawings and photographs showing the destruction of the Old Town during World War II, which adds a poignant layer to the panorama before you. Both historically significant and visually unforgettable, this tower is one of the highlights of visiting the castle.",
