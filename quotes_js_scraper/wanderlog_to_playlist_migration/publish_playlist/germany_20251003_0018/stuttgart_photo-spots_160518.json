The building is spectacular, and the way the exhibitions are laid out makes it easy to follow the history of the automobile from the very beginning up to modern times. The variety of vehicles on display is impressive, from the earliest cars to racing legends and special one-offs. It's a place where you could easily spend hours without noticing the time pass.\n\nMost of the staff were exactly what you would expect in a museum of this caliber: welcoming, polite, and professional. But unfortunately, one staff member (see photo) stood out in the worst possible way. She was stationed at the entrance to remind people about the rules regarding bags and drinks, which is of course a necessary task. However, instead of doing it in a respectful or friendly manner, she came across as outright rude. It wasn't just with us-she seemed to treat every visitor in the same abrupt and dismissive way.\n\nThere are countless ways to enforce rules while still showing basic respect, but she chose the opposite approach. Zero sense of social competence, and frankly the wrong person for that job. It left a very sour taste and is something the management should take seriously. One unfriendly encounter can damage the atmosphere that the rest of the staff work so hard to create.\n\nThat said, the museum itself is absolutely worth visiting. The cars, the architecture, and the storytelling are world-class. But I sincerely hope the management reconsiders who they put in front of guests, because one person's behavior should not be allowed to drag down an otherwise fantastic experience.",

The grounds are spacious, green, and absolutely beautiful - full of flowers, trees, and charming historic buildings. Walking through it feels like strolling through a fairytale park.\n\nThere's a huge variety of animals - from elephants and giraffes to the cutest koalas and vibrant tropical birds. The butterfly house was especially unforgettable - it's pure magic watching butterflies fly right past you. And the monkeys and penguins? Totally captivating!\n\nThe whole area is so cozy and thoughtfully designed, with plenty of benches, cafés, and quiet places to relax. You can tell the animals are well cared for, and everything is done with love. It's definitely one of the most wonderful places I've ever visited. If you're ever in Stuttgart - don't miss it!And if it were possible I would give it 10 stars, I'm delighted!😍😍",

Stepping onto the expansive grounds, you immediately feel the weight of history meeting the lightness of modern life. The sheer grandeur of the New Palace, with its creamy façade and stately presence, is captivating. Yet, what makes Schlossplatz truly special isn't the architecture alone, but the way it's used.\nOn a sun-drenched afternoon, the green lawns are a patchwork of people enjoying life. Students studying, friends sharing a picnic, families letting their kids run free-the atmosphere is one of relaxed, communal joy. The ornate fountains, with their gentle splashing, provide a soothing soundtrack to the urban buzz. And at the heart of it all, the Jubilee Column rises like a proud sentinel, crowned by the elegant figure of Concordia, the goddess of harmony. This monument, built to honor King Wilhelm I, perfectly encapsulates the plaza's purpose: a space for the people, for unity, and for shared experiences.\nI've seen Schlossplatz transform from a vibrant open-air concert venue to a magical Christmas market wonderland, complete with a skating rink. It's the place where the city celebrates, mourns, and simply exists. It's a reminder that a city's soul isn't just in its buildings, but in the people who bring them to life. Whether you're a tourist or a local, spending time at Schlossplatz is not just visiting a landmark; it's participating in the heartbeat of Stuttgart.",

There are tables inside on the ground floor, where the food is also ordered, and there's a second floor with more tables. There are also tables on the outside and when the weather is nice there's even some benches and a beer garden.

You can see the beautiful city centre and landmarks from here all the way to the iconic TV tower (Fernsehturm), take in the lush green hills while sitting peacefully on one of the many benches or low stone walls, or walk along the many paths leading up and downhill from this scenic point. Accessible and open 24/7 with no tickets needed, this is a great spot to hang out at or visit. To watch the sunset you can just cross over to the other side of the street for another panoramic hill. There's even a table tennis table, although it can often be too windy to play, given the openness of the area. Definitely recommend visiting if you're in Stuttgart, no matter the season!",

You can relax by the lake on one of the benches , grab a bite in one of the surrounding restaurants , take the boat for €7 for 30 mins, come with family and friends and use the barbecue grills, or sit on the beach chairs and sun bathe. Parking available in more than one spot around the lake. I visited the park on a moderately hot weekday and the clouds saved us every now and then from the heat of the sun . The only missing star is because the lake is full of moss, smelly in some parts and that restricted the area where we can go with the boat and made peddling a hard task.",

The site has strong ties to the houses in Dessau, Weimar, and Brno, which made the visit even more meaningful. My family and I truly loved exploring this gem at the top of Stuttgart. The Weissenhof Museum is a must-see for anyone interested in architecture and modernist design👌🏼",
