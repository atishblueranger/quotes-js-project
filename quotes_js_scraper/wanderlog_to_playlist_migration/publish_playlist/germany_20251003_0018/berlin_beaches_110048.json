The vibe is laid-back and summery, perfect for a relaxing break in the city.\n\nMake sure to book your slot in advance (around €8 for 2 hours) 😉it's totally worth it. The area is spacious, with a beach bar atmosphere, food and drink service, and beautiful views of the Spree, with the Molecule Man sculpture in the background.\n\nAfter a mandatory shower, you can dive into the refreshing 23°C water. The pool is up to 2 meters deep, but has shallower edges for more comfortable swimming and lounging.\n\nIn case you wanna take public transport:\nThe nearest S‑Bahn station is Treptower Park, about an 8-minute walk away. You can also take a bus to Heckmannufer, just 5 minutes from the venue.\n\nI absolutely loved it.\nA unique summer experience in Berlin  ☀️would go again in a heartbeat! 🏊🏼‍♀️",

This place feels less like a fun day out and more like a highly regulated, bureaucratic \"German experience.\" While the pool itself is impressive, the strict rules and a frustrating booking process take all the enjoyment away.\nThe biggest issue is the extremely limited access. You can only purchase tickets online exactly two days in advance, and you're locked into a rigid 1.5-hour time slot. If you're hoping to swim more than that, you're out of luck. The system is so strict that you can't even enter before your designated time.\nOnce you're finally in, you'll find even more restrictions. The water is surprisingly cold, and you're not allowed to take photos from the pool deck-for no stated reason. It feels like they've gone out of their way to make the entire experience as restrictive as possible.\nOverall, the beautiful pool is completely overshadowed by the complex rules and lack of flexibility. It's a shame, because it could be a great place. But in its current state, it's simply not worth the hassle.",

            "text": "It would seem positive reviews are based on days of reasonable solitude being part of the offer at Strandbad Wannsee… in the second / third week of July - rest assured as soon as you “come over the hill” on the inside patio of the strandbad - you will be facing literally thousands of other swimmers in waiting… you would be happy to find a private square meter or two.. The water itself is muddy at best. At one point this might have been fine sand from the Baltic Sea - today clay would be a more accurate description - filled with small stones that will have you anxiously waiting for when “disaster strikes” in the mind of a young swimmer.\nThe line to the refreshments and snacks would easily top 150 people - unknown to me what would be the time required to pass through til the service window.\n\nUpon our arrival having waited in line somewhat shorter than we feared - the guard tells us that dogs are not allowed (in spite of online info informing that there are several dog friendly seditions ) and she is forced to stay outside in spite of having completed ticket payments just moments ago. No refunds offered in spite of no entry.\n\nAll info online as well as IRL seemingly only available in German - which seems less smart in consideration of the fact that locals would presumably be smart enough to stay away this I would suspect overwhelming part of  visitors are indeed foreigners. Hence the fact that the small number of staff visible doesn't seem to speak anything else but German ensures that other visitors like myself really doesn't even have a chance at understanding the few official PA announcements…\n\nThere without a doubt will be other options in the Berlin region will you feel that immediate urge to go for a swim,,,",

The water is clean with a mostly sandy bottom. It was warm too they day we went. plenty of toilets. There are beach seats(wicker covered white ones) There is a room to the right of the main steps as you enter (past the food places) room has lockers, but you buy a flag to put on the beach chair to show you have paid. return the flag at end of the day and get your 2euro depoist back. Halbertag is for half a day hire. you can lift and move the chairs but it is a 2 person job. DO NOT BE EXPECTING ENGLISH TO BE SPOKEN-IT IS IN GERMANY AFTER ALL.
