Erected between 1385 and 1396, this impressive structure stands at an awe-inspiring height of 19 meters and resembles a grand church spire. The fountain features four tiers adorned with intricate gilding and showcases 40 vibrant figures that embody various aspects of medieval life under the Holy Roman Empire.",

When you come up to the fountain, you’ll see people lining up to turn it.",

            "text": "I spent a weekend in Nuremberg and booked my stay at Hotel Karl August in the Old Town - and wow, what an incredible experience from start to finish.\n\nI arrived at the hotel extremely early (check-in is at 3pm), but Leah at the front desk welcomed me warmly, took my bags, and even offered some great suggestions for places to visit in the meantime. When I came back around 5pm, I was greeted by Emilio, who upgraded my room and personally took my bags upstairs. He was incredibly friendly, and we got along great right away.\n\nShortly after settling into my room, I received a message on WhatsApp from reception asking if I was enjoying everything and if I needed anything - such a thoughtful and unexpected touch. I even shared some photos from my day with them, and the conversation stayed fun and friendly throughout my stay.\n\nThe facilities? Outstanding. The gym was spotless, stylish, and well-equipped - treadmills, a bike, rowing machine, high-tech smith machine, loads of water and towels - everything you'd want. The pool felt straight out of a Bond movie, sleek and modern with an epic city view. There's also a sauna, which I made full use of - a very cool extra.\n\nThe room itself was beautiful - comfortable, thoughtfully designed, and absolutely stunning from an architectural standpoint. Every corner of this place oozes style and class.\n\nI can't speak for every hotel in Nuremberg, but I can say with full confidence that I had an amazing experience at Hotel Karl August. I'd absolutely recommend it and would love to stay again next time I'm in town.\n\nThank you, Vincent, Anna, Emilio, Leah, and the rest of the team - you guys nailed it.",

My room was compact but cleverly designed: big window, plush bedding, and a bathroom with just-right lighting and great pressure in the shower.\n\nStaff felt genuinely welcoming-helpful tips about nearby coffee spots and even suggested a quieter local bar for later.

Starting with the Lavender Sparkling Wine, the steak tartar small bite, and the foie gras parfait, then the amazing Venison saddle with perfectly prepared sides! All courses served with paired wines.  The service was exceptional.  I wish I could dine here every night!",
