There are some fantastic walking trails along the cliffs with breathtaking views over the ocean and down to the grottoes. The paths are well-maintained, and there are plenty of spots to stop and take in the scenery.\n\nParking was easy and convenient, making it a great place to start your walk. The views from the top of the cliffs are stunning, especially if the weather's clear perfect for photos or just soaking in the natural beauty of the Algarve coast.\n\nHighly recommend it if you're in the area. A peaceful, scenic spot that's well worth a visit!",

From our apartment, we set off on foot-over 4 kilometers of rugged coastline, winding trails, and dramatic cliffs. The path itself felt like a preview of the spectacle to come: waves crashing below, seabirds gliding overhead, and the scent of salt and wildflowers in the air.\n\nAs we reached the edge of the cliffs, the sun began its slow descent. The sky transformed-first golden, then fiery orange, then a soft lavender that seemed to hush the crowd around us. For a moment, everyone stood still. Strangers became silent witnesses to something bigger than all of us.\n\nWe tried to capture it with our cameras, but no lens could do it justice. The real magic was in the feeling-the quiet awe, the shared wonder, the sense that we were exactly where we were meant to be.\n\nAnd yes, it was crowded. But somehow, that didn't matter. When nature puts on a show like that, you don't mind sharing the front row.",

Accessible by walking along wooden walkways or by car, the beach offers a longer shoreline compared to other nearby beaches. While lacking the dramatic rock formations of Ponta da Piedade, Praia do Canavial is perfect for surfing and body-boarding due to the Atlantic Ocean's strong winds and waves.",

Keep coming back in our stay as it just was not as busy and it felt less touristy than the main beaches. Would recommend",
