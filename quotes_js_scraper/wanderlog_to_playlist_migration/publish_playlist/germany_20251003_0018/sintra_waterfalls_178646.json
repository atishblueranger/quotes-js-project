Parked a car not at the nearest place, but slightly afar - was met with a furious barking of a big dog throwing itself on the gate so that it shook... such a shock. I recommend parking as near the waterfall as you can... The area resembles slums: ruined buildings and graffiti. Some people may like it. But looks creepy in the dusk. I met no one there, though, and was safe. Now the path to the waterfall isn't exactly dangerous, but rather unsafe to walk when it's wet. There are slippery stones, dead leaves and a big boulder which you have to climb over using your hands (it's safer so). You can't approach too close unless you want to risk a bit. Sadly, the waterfall itself was dirty, as someone threw rubbish there (pumpkins and fruit, probably pagan offerings or left from Halloween, all rotten and ugly). I felt very sad and disappointed. Of course one can still take nice pictures there... as well as ugly ones. I annex both. It's up to you to decide whether you want to give it a try or not.",
