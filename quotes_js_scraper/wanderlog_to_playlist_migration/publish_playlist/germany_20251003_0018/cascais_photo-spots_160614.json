We'll definitely come back here!\n\nWARNING: When swimming, be mindful of the rocks in the water! Double-check before diving in.\n\nOnly con: The water didn't seem the cleanest. There was heaps of random bits in it - I can't fully describe what all the stuff was. We still had a great time swimming, but it did feel a tad gross with different things floating about.\n\nHowever, we'd happily visit again! ☺️\n\nALSO! We HIGHLY recommend buying a pina colada from this stall on the street, before you go down the steps to the beach. You're served a whole pineapple with the tastiest pina colada freshly made in the pineapple. Once you have purchased a pineapple you can go back for refills for €5 per pineapple drink. It was soo nice having this on the beach 🤌🏼",
