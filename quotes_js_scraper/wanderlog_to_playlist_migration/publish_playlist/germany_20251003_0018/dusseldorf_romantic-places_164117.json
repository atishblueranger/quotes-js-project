The gardens surrounding the castle are stunning and very well maintained, and the best part is they are free to enter. There's a lovely café nearby that serves excellent coffee and delicious cakes, perfect for a relaxing break.\n\nI highly recommend purchasing your tickets online - not only is it more convenient, but they're also a euro cheaper than buying them at the ticket counter. It's also a good idea to arrive an hour or two earlier than your ticket time so you can take a leisurely stroll through the gardens. The area is peaceful, with plenty of birds to watch - a real treat for nature lovers.\n\nThe ticket also includes access to two nearby museums: the Museum of Garden Styles and another dedicated to the region's flora and fauna. Overall, it's a fantastic day out, blending history, nature, and a bit of culture. Highly recommend!",

It took about 30 minutes to get up to the observation deck, including waiting time and the elevator ride, which wasn't too bad at all.\n\nOnce we got to the top, the view was absolutely worth it. You can see the entire city of Düsseldorf from up there, including the Rhine River, old town, and beyond. It wasn't too crowded when we went, which made the experience more relaxing and enjoyable. We had plenty of space to take photos and enjoy the scenery without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.\n\nThere's also a nice restaurant and bar at the top. The atmosphere was calm and modern, and it's a great spot if you want to enjoy a drink or snack while admiring the view. Prices are a bit higher, as expected for a tourist spot, but the experience makes up for it.\n\nOverall, visiting the Rhine Tower was a highlight of our trip. I definitely recommend it for anyone spending time in Düsseldorf.",

The visit to the garden is free, the only requirement is not to be loud, as to not disturb the peace.\n\nYou can visit the museum for 3.5€ as of May 2025, not sure about prices later.\n\nIn the museum, you have the bottom hall which explores the Japanese letters, and the explanation is given in German, if you don't know it or don't have someone to explain, then you are not going to enjoy that part. The second part of the museum is when you have to take off your shoes and wear the white socks, then you explore traditional Japanese house. If you are young(er), you'll probably geek out like I did. You can keep or throw socks to trash.\n\nI went solo but if you want to relax you'll need like 30-50mins for both the Garden and Museum.\n\nAnd also I'd like to thank the receptionist at the desk in museum for being very kind and sweet.

A special shoutout to the gentleman at the entrance-he was extremely respectful and accommodating, even though we arrived without a reservation. Keep in mind that reservations are essential on weekends, as the place is massive yet still gets quite crowded.\n\nUnfortunately, taking photos of the stunning view isn't allowed since phones are prohibited, but trust me, it's a sight to behold! The food is on another level-highly recommend the ramen and the Vabali burger. And for dessert, don't miss the New York cheesecake; it's simply divine!",

The infinity pool with the amazing sunset was perfect, it appears to be near a lake. So calm. There's an indoor pool as well, several saunas that have the temp & and humidity. I don't think a jacuzzi unless I missed it.\n\nI loved the outside gardens, with lounge chairs. Very relaxing. I got a cappuccino & a brownie cake, delicious. 2 hours with my snacks was less than 50€...\n\nI was disappointed at the amount of people who snuck their phone in their robes, there was a group that was also taking pics from the top deck into the pool. Huge NO, NO... especially since everyone in their birthday suits.\n\nOtherwise, I highly recommend it! The sunset was amazing that evening.",

Important to know that the restaurant is inside the spa, so the time you spend waiting is also added on the time of the spa (you pay for hours… so perfect business…).\n\nA SPA is to relax but with so many people is not really possible.\n\nAlso a friend opened the locker, leave the bracalet (pass) next to him, and when he finnish changing, the bracalet was not there…\n\nImportant information we would like to know in addvance:\n-is allowed to bring your bottle of water, so you can refilled. Otherwise 3€ for a small bottle.\n-the parking from the spa cost 1,5€\n-is textil free so you must go nacked\n-It is 25' by car from Dusseldorf center\n\nI guess if you are there maybe for a weekend the experience is different… or maybe during weekdays is less busy… I do not know, but if you pay 3,5€ (on top of the final price) in addvance to book a spot, what it is not acceptable is that then there you still need to do long waiting lines.\n\nHope this aspects get improved because it is a really nice place.",

You get a chip with a number on it. This is the the number of your boat.\n3. After you hand in the numbered chip at the return, a total price will be calculated and deducted from the 25 you paid down. You get your change in cash.\n\n⭐Our 60-min boating of a two seater costs 12 euro. Another two seater at 74 minutes costs 14.80 euro.\n\n⭐Four seaters are in shorter supply and higher demand, so the wait is longer. It's always a good idea to get in the line early. We waited for about 20 minutes for the two-seaters.",

It costs 6 Euro a day to rent a beach chair on top of that. Nonetheless, I will definitely come back when I'm with friends and looking to play some beach volleyball or tan nude!
