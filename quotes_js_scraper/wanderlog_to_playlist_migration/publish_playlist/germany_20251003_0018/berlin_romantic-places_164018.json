We managed to get the last open locker as it was a busy day.\n\nGoing into the cathedral you are met with a quiet and serene space with some fantastic murals and carvings on the huge dome.\n\nWe spent 15-20 minutes just gazing around and admiring the huge organ (they have specific times when it's played but not when we had visited).\n\nYou can then climb up 267 steps which starts very normal and wide and then later becomes narrow and winding metal stairs. There are places to stop and catch your breath but there are warnings everywhere that you have to commit once you start and it's not a trivial climb.\n\nOnce up top you have fantastic views across the entire city and can walk around the entire dome admiring the 360 views. There was enough space to stop, admire the views and take plenty of pictures.  As it was a very warm day, the side away from the sun was cooler and hence more busy.\n\nOnce you have taken in the views you walk back down a different set of stairs (another 250+ steps) to a cafe area.\n\nDon't forget to go around the corner and fetch your bags.\n\nOverall a great place to learn the history, spend time in quiet contemplations and then get a workout for both your feet and your eyes.\n\nHighly recommend the 10 euro or so entrance fee (we bought online).\nThe local area there is full of museums and other sights not to be missed.",

This expansive park is a true highlight and offers a delightful escape from the city bustle.\n\nWhat truly stands out is the incredible diversity of the gardens. From the tranquil Chinese Garden of Harmonious Coexistence with its traditional architecture and serene ponds, to the meticulously designed Japanese Garden, and the vibrant colours of the Oriental Garden, each section transports you to a different part of the world. I particularly enjoyed wandering through the English Garden and getting lost in the unique landscapes of the Maze and Labyrinth.\n\nThe attention to detail in every garden is remarkable, and it's clear a lot of care goes into maintaining these beautiful spaces. Whether you're a keen gardener, a nature lover, or simply looking for a peaceful place to relax, there's something here for everyone. The pathways are well-maintained, and there are plenty of spots to sit, reflect, and enjoy the surroundings.\n\nI highly recommend spending at least a few hours, if not a whole day, exploring everything Gardens of the World has to offer. It's an enriching and incredibly pleasant way to spend your time in Berlin.",

The famous flea market was in full swing when I visited - stalls packed with vintage clothes, vinyl, art, handmade jewellery, and plenty of street food options. It's busy, but not overwhelming, and it has that creative, free-spirited vibe Berlin does so well.\n\nWhat really stood out is that even with the markets on, the park itself still has plenty of space. You can step away from the crowd into open green areas to picnic, relax, or just people-watch. Musicians, performers, and random jam sessions pop up everywhere, so there's always a soundtrack as you wander.\n\nThe mix of locals and travellers makes it feel welcoming, and you get that authentic “community meets culture” vibe. Whether you're there for treasure hunting at the stalls, catching some live music, or just lying on the grass soaking up the atmosphere, it's a must-visit.\n\nTip: go earlier if you want to explore the market without rushing, then spend the afternoon chilling in the park. Bring cash, an appetite, and time to really take it all in.",

The historical museum area nearest the tower is interesting as well and has some good information about the site and some artifacts to look at. There are other parts of the site you can visit -- eg, an art museum/exhibit, and also other parts of the site where you can see its old structures and architecture. It's not exactly \"exciting\", but it has some historical value and the entrance fee is low enough that it is of decent value despite its lack of \"fireworks\".\n\nThe climb to the tower is something kids can do (toddlers might get tired of the climb), and the view of the town from the top is a great reward. There is a viewing-scope (telescope) at the top that I think you can use a coin to use. It was a great experience for me to walk around the inside of the tower and imagine how it must have been to be an ancient person using the tower in a similar way long ago in the past. What fun!",

We bought a box of chocolate for a friend. After we came back to the US and ate it with our friends, we understood why fresh German chocolate is so good, even better than German chocolate in the US.\n\nI wished they offered tasting samples, we would have bought 2 or 3 more boxes if we had known it was that good.\n\nIf you're looking for a souvenir gift, buy these chocolate instead of a mug or some magnets. Your friends will truly thank you for it.\n\nThere are large chocolate bars for about $5 and a box of chocolate is about $20. You get to pick the flavors you like. Most have some alcohol or coffee in them, but some don't.\n\nBe warned, the store us constantly busy. There is a long line to get serviced, so they have prepackaged boxes for the same price. I suggest you wait for the service, where they explain the selections. We went twice, the first time the wait was unbelievable, so we left. The second time was raining and there were almost no customers and the shopping experience was very pleasant. They even gift wrapped the box for us, with a card from the service woman's signature.",

The park, probably designed by H. R. Küllenberg and built between 1912 and 1916 in the Neo-Baroque style, was intended by the city fathers to \"give the surrounding district a particularly decorative character and encourage the implementation of an outstandingly beautiful redevelopment and the creation of a particularly desirable residential area.\"\nRestoration\nEdit\nBecause the park lay directly in the flight path of the then Tempelhof Airport until its closure in 2008, it gradually fell into disrepair. Nevertheless, starting in 1977, the district office began to restore the gardens based on existing documents. The cascade system and the canals were renovated. Potted plants have now returned to the terrace in front of the Orangery, and the rich perennial plantings have been renewed.",

So you can add this stop as a bathroom break.\n\nAlso there is a nice museum store right before the bathroom. The free lockers are just before the bathroom.  If they are all taken go to the right of the ticket register and there is a free coat check area to check everything you need.\n\nMostly sculptures and some masterpieces. Don't expect the British Museum or the Met, but it's a decent sized to spend about 1-2 hours roaming around. We paid and spent 2hrs to see all the collections. There is also a free English tour in the afternoon. Check the time on their website before you go if you want to learn about German art.\n\nDefinitely add as a stop if you're near Museum Island. Even if just for a restroom break. The grounds have plenty of sculptures you can view for free and sit to enjoy the scenery.",
