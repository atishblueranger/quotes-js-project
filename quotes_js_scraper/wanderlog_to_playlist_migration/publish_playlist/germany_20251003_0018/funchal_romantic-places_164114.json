Its a vast and winding maze of interconnected pathways so takes a good few hours to fully explore, and easy to get lost. Also can be steep in places.\n\nBest visited by the cable car from Funchal that stops right outside. There are cafes and a few random toilets dotted around, but take a packed lunch and just sit and enjoy the views whilst eating.\n\nIt can be noticably cooler in the gardens due to the altitude and cover, so dress accordingly and wear sturdy shoes.

Visiting it is not just a walk through a garden, but a full sensory experience that leaves you refreshed and inspired.\n\nFrom the moment you enter, you are greeted with spectacular terraces filled with vibrant flowers, exotic plants, and lush greenery that reflect Madeira's rich biodiversity. The garden is beautifully organized, with each area showcasing unique species from around the world, as well as plants that are native to Madeira and rarely found elsewhere.\n\nOne of the highlights is the famous patterned flower beds, arranged like a giant carpet of colors – a masterpiece of natural design and a perfect spot for photos. Another unmissable feature is the panoramic view over Funchal and the Atlantic Ocean, which is simply breathtaking and makes the entire visit unforgettable.\n\nBeyond the stunning beauty, the garden also has a strong educational aspect. The labels and explanations are clear and informative, offering insights into the extraordinary flora housed here. You feel both relaxed and enriched by learning about such diversity in one place.\n\nThe atmosphere is calm and welcoming, with benches and shaded spots where you can simply sit, take in the scenery, and enjoy a moment of peace. The staff maintain the grounds with great care, ensuring everything looks immaculate.\n\nWhether you are a plant enthusiast, a photography lover, or simply someone who wants to connect with nature while appreciating one of Madeira's treasures, the Botanical Garden is an absolute must-visit.\n\n🌿 I left with my heart full of joy and my camera full of beautiful memories. This place truly shows why Madeira is called the “Garden of the Atlantic.” Highly recommended! 🌿",

There were too many sandwiches to go through each one, but they were all delicious. Then the scones & cakes, again delightful, all very tasty.  Plus, we were offered more if the need took, yes, we did, but only a couple, rude not to. We were given unlimited pots of our respective teas during the eating. Then, to top it off, we had a cocktail each, which again was lovely, all topping the afternoon off brilliantly.\nSo if in mind a little treat, can't go wrong at Reids Hotel, Funchal.

            "text": "Petrolhead Heaven at its Finest – Classics at Magnolia is a Must-Visit for Any Motoring Enthusiast\n\nAttended Classics at Magnolia recently and was absolutely blown away. This wasn't just a car meet - it was a full-on celebration of engineering heritage, passion, and curation. Whether you're into American muscle, vintage British 4x4s, ultra-rare European icons, or just love mechanical art in motion, there's something here that'll stop you in your tracks.\n\nRight off the bat, the atmosphere was spot-on. Held on the beautiful grounds at Magnolia, the field was completely packed with vehicles but never felt cramped or chaotic. It was well laid out, making it easy to stroll between rows and take in every machine properly. This wasn't just quantity - it was quality and variety, immaculately presented.\n\n🚗 Personal Highlights:\n\nAs the proud owner of an '84 Corvette back home, I was buzzing to see a 1958 Corvette on display. The chrome, the quad headlights, the curves - an absolute masterclass in American styling. I spent a good 15 minutes just soaking that car in. You could feel the pride in the presentation too - not just show-and-shine, but genuine appreciation for what that car represents.\n\nThen there was the 1959 Cadillac. It looked like it had just driven off a Sinatra set - towering fins, sweeping lines, and enough chrome to reflect the entire countryside. There's something uniquely theatrical about late-'50s American luxury, and this Caddy absolutely nailed it.\n\nThe surprise standout for me was the small collection of Land Rovers from the 1950s - Series I and IIs, lovingly preserved or tastefully restored. Seeing those classic utilitarian shapes lined up next to sleek sports cars gave a brilliant sense of how broad the motoring world really is. You could almost picture them crawling through muddy farm tracks decades ago, still looking rugged today.\n\nAnd let's not forget the very early motorcycles on show - some pre-war examples that looked like rolling sculptures. Simple, raw, and elegant in their design. A few marques I hadn't seen in person before, which is saying something.\n\n🚤 Showstopper Moment:\n\nThere was even a Riva Aquarama on site - yes, the legendary Italian speedboat. That alone is a half-a-million-pound piece of rolling (floating?) luxury. With its gleaming mahogany hull and twin engines, it looked like it had been pulled straight from a Monaco postcard. Easily one of the rarest and most valuable pieces there - and a bold, beautiful choice to feature at a classic car show.\n\n💬 Overall Vibe:\n\nPeople were friendly, knowledgeable, and clearly passionate about what they'd brought. No ego, just shared appreciation and plenty of great conversations. You could talk to owners, swap stories, and learn a few unexpected facts even if you thought you knew the vehicle inside and out.\n\nThere must have been well over £5 million worth of machinery on display, but the show never felt elitist or inaccessible. It struck that perfect balance between enthusiast gathering and public showcase.\n\n📸 Tips:\n\nBring your camera - the visual mix is incredible.\n\nWear good shoes - it's all on grass.\n\nArrive early for parking and best light if you're taking photos.\n\nAnd if you're a fan of a specific era or brand, give yourself time - there's more than enough to keep you busy.\n\n🔧 Final Verdict:\n\nClassics at Magnolia is more than just a car show - it's a living museum, a community gathering, and a love letter to machines that still turn heads and stir hearts decades after they left the factory floor. I'll definitely be back next time, and if you're even remotely interested in automotive history, you should be too. An absolute five-star experience.",

A clear example is the fish market square, where tourists don't buy and only a few stalls are still open, with hardly any customers. Meanwhile, fruit stalls selling at €50/kg and souvenir stands are packed. These kinds of places deserve more protection.

As well as an incredible view of the fish tables with the workers cutting the fresh fish off as you order it. This was a lovely trip to this local market, I would recommend, just keep your wits about you for pricing and haggling techniques.",

Sorry guys, not worth the money!\nFirst, when we arrived in the floor where the elevator lets you out, many employees were running around but no one cares about you. After we asked someone where the restaurant is, someone told us some kind of impolite: we have to wait at the small shop, someone picks us up. Ok 👍 after the pickup, they brought us to the restaurant with another elevator. So far, so good.\n\nThere are four waiters running this restaurant. Only one is smiling while talking to you. The other ones are not interested and very neutral. 😐 why is that? No smalltalk? Not even ONE was asking, if we liked the food after every course.\nOnly „are you finished?“…\n\nThe Aperol Spritz was made with an old Prosecco and we got a new one after telling the bad quality of the Aperol. Also no one asked, if we want some wine for the dinner…\nWhen the main course arrived, the waitress noticed, that there is no wine and asked us, if we want some…But much to late…sorry.\n\nCome on guys! You had only 6-8 tables to serve with a team of 4!\n\nThe meals are really nice decorated and very tasty. No complaining about the food, but the service is a challenge.\n\nAlso: why is there 8 Euros for the bread and butter called „couvert“ on the bill?\nWe didn't order that… bread and butter is complementary in a restaurant. Why do you charge it as a service fee? After noticing that, I regret to gave you a tip, because you already grab 8 Euros for bread.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the food is really tasty and really nice on the plate, but you could be Full House every night with a good service team.\n\nSorry guys, not worth the money! Not even a warm wish for the guests when they leave…\n„Thank you for being with us“ OR „have a good night“ is a minimum I expect as a guest. So sad… 😞 that's the coldest service I had for a long time.\n\nMy recommendation: don't go there! There are tons of better places in town.",

They are overwhelmingly sweet, to the point of being nearly inedible-like biting into pure sugar.\n\nPerhaps this level of sweetness is common in Madeira, but it's worth noting that consuming something this sugary isn't great for health and could contribute to issues like diabetes.\n\nTo whoever makes these chocolates: please consider balancing the flavors by keeping the outer chocolate darker and less sweet, with the sweetness concentrated in the filling. In your current recipe, both the outer chocolate and the filling are excessively sweet, which overwhelms the palate.",
