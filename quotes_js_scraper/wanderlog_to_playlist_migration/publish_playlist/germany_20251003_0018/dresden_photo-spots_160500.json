            "text": "Old Masters Gallery in Dresden is a world class collection of paintings from a period spanning 15th to 18th centuries. It is a must-visit museum which is very professionally run. In my first visit, my primary motivation was to see the Dresden Triptych by the master Flemish painter Jan Van Eyck (this is one of the few -about 20- remaining paintings by him). It is truly breathtaking to see how much painterly skill he had. Understandably, they keep it under a glass enclosure. After the first one,  I visited this museum a few more times.\n\nOverall, it is a unique collection with many great artists (Rembrandt, Vermeer, Holbein the younger, Ribera, Titian etc.) and paintings to choose as favorites. But the real suprise for me was to see the 18th century veduta paintings (cityscapes) by Bernardo Bellotto. The detail and precision with which he captured Dresden and the surrounding provinces is remarkable. As someone who loves landscape paintings and is a fan of Claude Lorrain, John Constable and Joseph Mallord William Turner (each had very distinct styles, of course), it was such a pleasant suprise to discover an artist like Belotto.\n\nI will definitely come back!",
