We absolutely loved this place!\nI wouldn't hesitate to go back to this stunning place again and again if I were to return to Portugal. I would call this place “Fairytale Land” it had beautiful architecture everywhere, fairytale towers that you could climb up via spiral staircases, manicured gardens, woodland walks, out of this world initiation wells and an abundance of underground caves! Once you are inside, the place is so vast, you could not possibly get bored. The initiation well was absolutely awesome which led you to the first series of underground caves. It was just one splendour after another. Then when you thought you had seen most things you would stumble upon another underground caves network (without lighting) so the torch on your phone will come in handy! Honestly I think this is one of the loveliest places we have been to. I was excited to be there and the beauty and splendour of this place was simply jaw dropping!\nThe queue system wasn't so great mind. Definitely book a ticket in advance. Then go to the front of the queue- as there seemed to be two queues- one for the current time slot - then a second queue for later time slots. To get in you have to go to the front queue (which tends to be quite short) . However the second queue will just leave you getting nowhere fast!",

She suggested cod a la bras which is a traditional Portuguese dish and her comfort food, and it did not disappoint! The pork secretos was also 10/10. We also tried the duck escabeche which is a cold dish served with pickled red cabbage and mandarin which was also tasty but not as good as the other too! We were celebrating a birthday and they brought out a spoonful of really nice chocolate mousse with a candle in it which was a lovely touch! The whole dinner only came to €69 so incredible value. Would highly recommend to anyone",

They have free bathrooms where you can also change to your swimming suit which is a big plus. It's a sandy beach so don't worry for rocks or anything else because you don't need beach shoes. The water was a little cold but little by little we managed in the end to get in and it was amazing. You will fond very nice tiny golfs where you can swim between the rocks.\n\nI strongly recommend this beach!",

We loved how it was nestled in a cove-like area, with the rock formations surrounding you, plus it is right beside all of the beautiful, old streets - you only need to walk down some steps and you're on the beach. We'll definitely come back here!\n\nWARNING: When swimming, be mindful of the rocks in the water! Double-check before diving in.\n\nOnly con: The water didn't seem the cleanest. There was heaps of random bits in it - I can't fully describe what all the stuff was. We still had a great time swimming, but it did feel a tad gross with different things floating about.\n\nHowever, we'd happily visit again! ☺️\n\nALSO! We HIGHLY recommend buying a pina colada from this stall on the street, before you go down the steps to the beach. You're served a whole pineapple with the tastiest pina colada freshly made in the pineapple. Once you have purchased a pineapple you can go back for refills for €5 per pineapple drink. It was soo nice having this on the beach 🤌🏼",

The waiters, the service, even the tableware everything was on point and more.\n\nWe had empanadas, milanesa, and a lomo with fries and mashed potatoes. Everything was insanely good. Before the meal, they brought us a typical table service with classic Argentine sauces. Honestly, a great touch and super tasty.\n\nIf you're visiting Portugal, this place is an absolute must. Authentic vibes and amazing food.",

We found them online, and despite never visiting in person, the team responded quickly and made the planning so easy. We had a 4 course meal for 25 guests and every bite was delicious. We had steaks, several family style sides, a summer salad, and desserts and I would recommend all of it! The steaks were so good but very large, definitely enough for two. We also had empanadas and sausage for starters and our guests loved them! The restaurant looks exactly as it does in the photos which was helpful for planning from a distance. If we were local, we would absolutely be regular customers.",

From the moment we arrived, we felt warmly welcomed, thanks to the attentive and kind staff, including Ricardo, Bruno, and Antonio, who made us feel at home throughout the evening.\n\nTo start, we were treated to some delightful house specialties that set the tone for the meal. The fresh prawns, briny olives, and rich Portuguese cheese (akin to cottage cheese but far superior) were accompanied by a basket of mixed bread and another variety of Portuguese cheese. Each bite was a celebration of freshness and local flavour, perfectly complementing the beautiful seaside ambiance.\n\nTheir bar menu impressed with its selection of Portuguese beers and creative cocktails, offering great options to pair with the meal. The main courses, however, were the true stars. Standout dishes included the shellfish curry, squid and prawns on a spit, and noodles with grouper and shrimps-each presented with flair and bursting with unique flavors. Every dish was thoughtfully prepared, showcasing fresh ingredients and impeccable culinary artistry.\n\nA particularly charming touch to the experience was the personal dishing out of the meals at the table. This added a layer of intimacy and attentiveness, making us feel truly cared for.\n\nDesserts at Furnas Do Guincho are not to be overlooked! The mango mousse, almond tart, and cheesecake were all delightful finales to a perfect meal, each one indulgent and exquisitely crafted.\n\nFrom start to finish, the service was outstanding, and the staff's warmth truly elevated the dining experience. Furnas Do Guincho is a gem in Cascais, combining breathtaking views, stellar food, and exemplary hospitality into one unforgettable evening. Highly recommended for anyone visiting this beautiful coastal town!",

We had three types of mussels which were good. Large servings. The only suggestion I might have is that the sauce was a lot in volume. When you finished half the pleasure is in consuming the infused mussel broth. Less water more cream Prehaps. The staff are welcoming and friendly. Might do with an electronic system to keep track of drinks etc. Our drinks were missed 3x. It did not take away from the meal but if you're going to charge top prices for Gins etc finish the order. I do prefer chilled beer glasses. A small point but if you trying for the upper end. Bread was excellent ask for it heated. I would go back.",

First, the hotel's location on the beach is stunning. The Dom Carlos room has enormous windows that provided our guests the most wonderful, beautiful view. We worked with Marta, who we cannot recommend highly enough. She worked incredibly diligently to ensure every detail of our event went smoothly. She helped us coordinate rental furniture and flower arrangement delivery. She was professional, responsive to emails, and genuine. We felt very supported and heard by her and her team.\n\nThe welcome party was perfect. We cannot say enough amazing things about the FOOD. Everyone loved it. Nobody was bored. The bartenders were professional and quick to make sure people had a drink. We were able to choose several signature cocktails which our guests loved. If you are getting married in or around Cascais we highly recommend the Hotel Albatroz as a potential rehearsal dinner / welcome party space!!",

You're right on the water with easy access to the center of Cascais. The restaurant is exceptional. Easily one of the best meals I've had in the area. Service was excellent throughout, very attentive without being overbearing.\n\nA couple of things could be better. The corridors aren't well soundproofed. You can hear people talking like they're standing inside your room, at least on the floor we were on. Also, the water in the bathrooms gets way too hot, to the point of being uncomfortable.\n\nStill, it's a solid hotel. I'd come back, but I'd book a quieter room.

He gave me great feedback and tips on my gybes and I made real progress in our time together. He also made sure all of the gear and equipment was properly sized for me, my skill level and the  conditions that day. It was so thoughtful and really enabled me to get the most out of our time together. I cannot say enough about how excellent Eduardo and the shop overall was!!!",

The breakfast was outstanding, with a fantastic variety of high-quality options. The pool was lovely, and the spa facilities were exceptional, featuring a beautiful sauna where you could watch the sunset in the evenings. The gym was also well-equipped for a hotel gym.\n\nHowever, the standout aspect of my stay was definitely the staff. Ricardo and Luis took care of us on several evenings and ensured our dining experience was nothing short of exceptional. They truly are a credit to the hotel and the main reason I'm giving this place a well-deserved 5-star rating!",

There is no door between the bedroom and the bathroom/ toilet so it will be really awkward for friends or teenager siblings staying in the same room. The breakfast was really great. Many choices, especially the fruit bar was super nice. A lot of staff running around taking away your dish too soon.😆",

            "text": "I recently stayed at this hotel and was extremely dissatisfied with our experience. It's hard to believe that this place is rated 5-stars given the significant lack of professionalism and organization.\n\n1. Heating Problem in Our Room\nOn our first night, we felt cold but thought it might just be the change in climate. However, the real issue became evident when we returned from an event on the second day to find our room freezing, with the temperature only at 19°C despite setting the thermostat. After waiting over two hours with no resolution after reporting the problem to reception, we were told the staff member who could help had an emergency. Not only was this shocking, but it was also unacceptable that we weren't informed about the delay or given the option to move rooms in a timely manner. Finally, the heating was fixed on our third day, which is simply not acceptable.\n\n2. Confusion with Airport Transfer\nWe arranged for an early airport transfer through reception, and while the taxi arrived on time, the ordeal that followed was ridiculous. Upon arriving at the airport, the driver claimed the hotel would cover the fare. I received a message hours later insisting I needed to pay 70 euros because of a misunderstanding. This is absurd! I had not ordered the taxi and shouldn't be held responsible for the driver's assumptions. I even requested proof of the fare, yet the staff demanded payment before I could see a receipt. Although I eventually paid just to settle the matter, this entire situation was handled poorly and should never have happened.\n\nOverall, I expected far more from a hotel of this caliber. I hope they take steps to improve their service and accountability in the future. My advice? Look elsewhere for your stay.",
