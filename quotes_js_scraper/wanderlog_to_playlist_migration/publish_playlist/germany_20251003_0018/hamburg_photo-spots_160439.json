Architecturally, it is a masterpiece-modern, innovative, and with a sense of elegance that immediately stands out. The design is both cutting-edge and inviting, and the panoramic views it offers over the city and the harbor are absolutely breathtaking. It's one of those landmarks that feels both futuristic and seamlessly integrated into its surroundings, making it a must-see for anyone visiting Hamburg.\n\nOne of the aspects I really appreciated is the accessibility. Entrance is free, although you need to queue in order to receive a timed ticket to pass through the turnstiles. The process is well organized, and while there can be a wait, it is usually manageable. For those who prefer not to stand in line, there is the option to purchase a “skip-the-line” ticket for just a few euros, which I found to be very convenient and worth considering during peak hours.\n\nInside, the atmosphere continues to impress. The space is bright, airy, and beautifully maintained, offering plenty of opportunities to take in the surroundings at your own pace. The store located within the building is also worth a visit: it is stylish, well-curated, and features a nice selection of souvenirs and design objects that reflect the spirit of Hamburg.\n\nOverall, this building is much more than just a viewpoint-it's a cultural and architectural highlight that combines innovation, beauty, and accessibility. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to experience one of the most remarkable perspectives of Hamburg.",

Guided tours of the city hall are well worth taking, as you can enter areas not open to the general public and hear many interesting stories.\n\nCurrently, Hamburg's mayor's office, as well as the meeting rooms of the parliament and senate, are located in the city hall.\n\nIn one of the city hall's rooms, there is a large painting depicting the scene when the Speaker led a group of councillors into the new city hall after its completion. At that time, everyone wore neat formal attire. According to the tour guide, that formal attire was handed down through generations, was very heavy and difficult to clean, and is no longer in use.\n\nThe most beautiful room in the city hall is where the mayor meets with the administrative departments. In front of the doors of the room are two statues of goddesses representing justice and mercy respectively. On the door frame was written in German: GOTT MIT UNS., which means God is with us. Some abbreviations SPQH were seen outside the room. The tour guide explained that this was a reference to the Roman abbreviation SPQR. In Roman times, SPQR represented the Roman Senate and People. We think SPQH probably stands for Senate and People of Hamburg.",

The beach offers lovely views of the Elbe River, passing ships, and even massive container vessels, giving it a truly one-of-a-kind charm. It's a great spot to relax, take a stroll, or enjoy a picnic with friends.\n\nThat said, it's not your typical soft-sand, swim-friendly beach.. the sand can be coarse, and swimming isn't recommended due to the strong currents and busy ship traffic. On sunny days, it can also get quite crowded, and there aren't many nearby facilities (like toilets or food vendors), so it's best to come prepared.\n\nStill, for a beach day in the heart of Hamburg, Elbstrand offers a peaceful vibe, especially at sunset.

The \"beach\" houses are beautiful as are the front yards leading down to the water. Also lots of restaurants and bars along the way from Elbstrand to Strandperle. One of the highlights of my Hamburg visit - but again, only do this if the weather is good.",

Acknowledging the fact that I was  wearing shoes I understand that I should have worn sandals without socks but I was never expecting it to be like this. The view from the beach was mainly cargo ships and boats but that couldn't ruin my day. The weather was a tough challenge I had to face but this won't change my great opinion on this place, I will definitely visit again once it cools down.
