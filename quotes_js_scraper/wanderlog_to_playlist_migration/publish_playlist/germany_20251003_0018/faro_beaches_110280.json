Everything feels pristine and cared for, with plenty of bins around to keep it that way.\n\nYou can rent comfy sunbeds, and the on-site restaurant even offers takeaway drinks and food - perfect for enjoying right on the beach. It's so easy to lose track of time here, you could happily spend the whole day soaking it all in. 🥰\n\nThe ferry is €5 one way, but remember to buy your return ticket at the kiosk. Tip: don't make our mistake and book your return too early - you'll want to stay longer than you think!\n\nA truly stunning spot that's absolutely worth a visit. 🌊✨",

            "text": "When you think of the quintessential beach experience, Praia da Ilha Deserta in the south of Portugal ticks all the boxes. I recently spent an entire day here, and it was nothing short of blissful. From the reasonable rental prices for umbrellas and chairs to the serene and scarcely populated beach, every aspect of this hidden gem contributes to a perfect day of relaxation and enjoyment.\n\nOne of the most appealing features of Praia da Ilha Deserta is its name, which translates to \"Deserted Island Beach.\" True to its name, this beach offers an unparalleled sense of tranquility and seclusion. Unlike many other beaches that are often overcrowded, this location remains relatively empty, even during peak seasons. This gives visitors the rare opportunity to enjoy the beach's natural beauty without the usual hustle and bustle. For those seeking a peaceful retreat from the chaos of daily life, Praia da Ilha Deserta is an ideal choice.\n\nThe beach itself is a picture-perfect scene. The clear, turquoise waters gently lap against the soft, golden sand, creating an inviting and serene atmosphere. The panoramic view is nothing short of spectacular. As you lounge under the shade of an umbrella, the endless horizon and the rhythmic sound of the waves offer a meditative experience that's hard to find elsewhere. Whether you're an avid photographer looking to capture stunning landscapes or simply someone who appreciates natural beauty, this beach provides a visual feast.\n\nRenting amenities here is both convenient and affordable. The cost to rent an umbrella and chairs is quite reasonable, which is a significant advantage for those planning to spend the entire day at the beach. This thoughtful provision ensures that visitors can relax in comfort without worrying about bringing their own gear. The process is straightforward, and the staff is friendly and accommodating, enhancing the overall experience.",

We took our own taxi boat which is more convenient and quicker (10 minutes vs. 25 mins with the ferry). In the tourist center in the \"new marina\" they charge you 35€ pp. Drop that and call the taxi boat directly, then you will pay 35€ for the entire ride even though you are more than one person. The beach at Culatra is obviously more crowded now than when I visited it last time (22 years ago...) but is still worth a visit. The beach now has sunbeds/umbrellas (15€ for 2 beds + umbrella) and a kiosk which serves drinks, ice cream and some snacks (crisps and micro burgers). All driven by sun panels (so you can pay cash, with Paypal app or Revolut app). The sea is also warmer than other areas of the Algarve due to the winds. Despite the effort, I strongly recommend to go here!",

Once you dock you walk through the quaint little town following signs for the beach, its easy walking on the boardwalk. After about 1km you reach the Atlantic ocean, the beach is spectacular with gorgeous sand & blue sea. We opted to walk along the beach to Farol. Took about 40mins, bit harder walking on sand but lovely to paddle. The beach at Farol is fine, perhaps not quite as nice as further along but still good. Spent few hours here, had lunch at the Maramais then got 4pm ferry back. A perfect day ⛱️🍻😎",
