Otherwise however the water is clear!\nNo showers or changing rooms and only mobile toilets.\nParking is available, but in summer it is always overcrowded. Rather opt for a bus.\nDuring the summer season at least 1 truck is parking at the beach with icecream and cold drinks (no coffee though 😢)\nThere is also a hiking/cycling route around the lake.
