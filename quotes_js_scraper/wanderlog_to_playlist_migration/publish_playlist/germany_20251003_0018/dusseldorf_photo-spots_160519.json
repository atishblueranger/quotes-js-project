It took about 30 minutes to get up to the observation deck, including waiting time and the elevator ride, which wasn't too bad at all.\n\nOnce we got to the top, the view was absolutely worth it. You can see the entire city of Düsseldorf from up there, including the Rhine River, old town, and beyond. It wasn't too crowded when we went, which made the experience more relaxing and enjoyable. We had plenty of space to take photos and enjoy the scenery without feeling rushed or overwhelmed.\n\nThere's also a nice restaurant and bar at the top. The atmosphere was calm and modern, and it's a great spot if you want to enjoy a drink or snack while admiring the view. Prices are a bit higher, as expected for a tourist spot, but the experience makes up for it.\n\nOverall, visiting the Rhine Tower was a highlight of our trip. I definitely recommend it for anyone spending time in Düsseldorf.",

Just the view is worth every penny. I consider the drink and housemade cake a free throw-in.",

The gardens surrounding the castle are stunning and very well maintained, and the best part is they are free to enter. There's a lovely café nearby that serves excellent coffee and delicious cakes, perfect for a relaxing break.\n\nI highly recommend purchasing your tickets online - not only is it more convenient, but they're also a euro cheaper than buying them at the ticket counter. It's also a good idea to arrive an hour or two earlier than your ticket time so you can take a leisurely stroll through the gardens. The area is peaceful, with plenty of birds to watch - a real treat for nature lovers.\n\nThe ticket also includes access to two nearby museums: the Museum of Garden Styles and another dedicated to the region's flora and fauna. Overall, it's a fantastic day out, blending history, nature, and a bit of culture. Highly recommend!",
