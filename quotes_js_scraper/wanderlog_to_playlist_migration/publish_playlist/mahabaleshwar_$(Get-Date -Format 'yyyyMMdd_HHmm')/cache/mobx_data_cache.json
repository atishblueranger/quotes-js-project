We went during May end , so the evening breeze by the lake was so soothing. Gets extremely crowded during peak tourist season. There are ample parking spots, but due to the rush of tourists, it is very difficult to find a parking spot nearby. I have seen families walk a considerable distance from their parking area to reach the lake. It all depends upon whether you get a parking or not , if you have a driver, they may drop you at a distance. Apart from this, the lake vicinity has different activities like boat riding , horse riding, etc, and way too many fast food joints selling all kinds of food and drinks. There are fruit vendors , toy vendors , and so many shop keepers all around. If you just want to sit by the lake and watch the sunset amidst all the cacophony , come a bit early and sit a little away from the main entrance point."

If you’re visiting with just two people and want to go for a boat ride, I highly recommend opting for a speedboat, which costs around ₹800 for 6 people and 1 child for 30 minutes. The price is fixed regardless of whether you’re 2, 3, or 6 people. Be cautious of scammers in the area – they may offer to arrange for 3-4 other people to join, but they’ll charge more than the actual price and won’t provide tickets. Remember, when you buy tickets, insurance is included, so if there’s any accident , the boat service management won’t be held responsible."

The lush greenery and long distance landscape for taking pictures is what makes this point photographers paradise. Make sure you come before 5pm otherwise tourist cars flock this place and you wont be able to get parking. Though if you have driver than you can ask him to park car away and recall after visiting this point. Overall a very chilling place in evening to end you day with calm and peace and the wind blows out of proportion during monsoon, so be careful with kids."

The place is Serene and lush green. It gets bit difficult to reach this place as Google maps shows a path which goeas through a private property which ends going further. So better to follow sign boards available on the road.\nIf you want to spot a perfect location to view sunrise better reach the place by 6:15.

But all the fun is spoiled because of the extremely narrow road leading to the point (up to the parking area that barely accommodates 10 cars, beyond which you must walk). The cement road is narrow and elevated about a foot from ground. You have to drive carefully to avoid either to stop the left wheel from going off the road into the ditch, or rubbing the vehicles coming from the other side. If you are traveling in an expensive car, it's best to avoid this place."

If you love being at a little crowded place and enjoy the sunset. This is a place for you. But if you love to enjoy sunset at silence this might not be the ideal spot for it. For that you need to stop your car at a random place where you get the perfect view away from the crowd. Cheers!!"

From the point where there is a sign board and tarred road ends, just trek down straight for around 2kms through a jungle like trail. You will reach an open space, from where you can have a very beautiful panoramic view of the vast expanse around. Chinaman waterfalls, a beautiful cascading falls can be seen from here better with the help of Binoculars or can be snapped elegantly by a camera with telephoto lens."

Thanks to continuous rainfall, the path is often covered with algae, making the walk slightly slippery but also thrilling—especially for nature lovers. Early mornings are the best time to visit, as the cool breeze and peaceful ambiance create the perfect setting for watching the sunrise.\n\nWhile the view during other times of the day may not be as captivating, the surrounding landscape of rolling green hills still offers a refreshing break from city life.\n\nEntry is completely free, and there’s no charge for parking, though space is quite limited. The location is approximately 8 kilometers from the town, making it a quick and scenic getaway."

Very yummy and delicious 😋 food.\nRecommend Order: Makkai cheese Frankie, Fresh strawberry with toppings.\n\nBagicha Corner in Mahabaleshwar offers a delightful culinary experience amidst a charming garden setting. During my visit, I savored the Makkai Cheese Frankie, Puri Bhaji, Aloo Paratha, and Makkai Sabzi with Roti. Each dish was flavorful and satisfying, with the Makkai Cheese Frankie standing out for its perfect blend of spices and cheesy goodness.\n\nFor dessert, I indulged in fresh strawberries with cream and a strawberry milkshake. The strawberries were fresh and sweet, complemented by the rich cream, making for a refreshing treat. The strawberry milkshake was equally delightful, capturing the essence of Mahabaleshwar's renowned strawberry produce.\n\nThe café's ambiance is enhanced by its beautiful garden, featuring a variety of flowers and strawberry plants in pots, creating a serene and picturesque environment. This natural setting adds to the overall dining experience, making it a must-visit spot for both food enthusiasts and nature lovers.\n\nBagicha Corner is also known for its strawberry-based desserts, which are a highlight for many visitors. The combination of delectable food and a tranquil garden setting makes it a memorable destination in Mahabaleshwar."

But as soon as we reached… the rain just disappeared! Not even a single drop! It was like the rain said, “Okay, my job is done. You guys take care now.”\n\nInstead, we were welcomed by thick clouds everywhere. Couldn’t see much ahead while driving – the fog was like “peekaboo!” every few minutes. But honestly, the cloudy weather made the whole place look magical. The valleys, trees, and hills covered in clouds looked straight out of a movie scene.\n\nWe missed the rain, but the cool weather and peaceful vibes made up for it. Sitting on a hilltop with hot chai and roasted corn in that fog… pure bliss. It felt like the clouds came just to give us a cozy hug.\n\nSo yeah, Mahabaleshwar didn’t give us rain, but it gave us something better — quiet, calm, and some unforgettable views. Highly recommend going there if you want a break from all the city noise. Just… don’t chase the rain. It’s faster than it looks!"

At the Mahad Toll Booth we have to take the left turn going downhill and the grounds are located about 1 km from the junction. The grounds are good for horse riding practice, trekking and bicycling. Many tourists bring their car here to teach their kids or friends driving as well. There is a helipad here too. Generally avoidable in the monsoon as the grounds become slushy. More local people play cricket here early in the morning. Polo is not so popular these days."
