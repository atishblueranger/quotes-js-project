But as soon as we reached… the rain just disappeared! Not even a single drop! It was like the rain said, “Okay, my job is done. You guys take care now.”\n\nInstead, we were welcomed by thick clouds everywhere. Couldn't see much ahead while driving – the fog was like “peekaboo!” every few minutes. But honestly, the cloudy weather made the whole place look magical. The valleys, trees, and hills covered in clouds looked straight out of a movie scene.\n\nWe missed the rain, but the cool weather and peaceful vibes made up for it. Sitting on a hilltop with hot chai and roasted corn in that fog… pure bliss. It felt like the clouds came just to give us a cozy hug.\n\nSo yeah, Mahabaleshwar didn't give us rain, but it gave us something better - quiet, calm, and some unforgettable views. Highly recommend going there if you want a break from all the city noise. Just… don't chase the rain. It's faster than it looks!",

We went during May end , so the evening breeze by the lake was so soothing. Gets extremely crowded during peak tourist season. There are ample parking spots, but due to the rush of tourists, it is very difficult to find a parking spot nearby. I have seen families walk a considerable distance from their parking area to reach the lake. It all depends upon whether you get a parking or not , if you have a driver, they may drop you at a distance. Apart from this, the lake vicinity has different activities like boat riding , horse riding, etc, and way too many fast food joints selling all kinds of food and drinks. There are fruit vendors , toy vendors , and so many shop keepers all around. If you just want to sit by the lake and watch the sunset amidst all the cacophony , come a bit early and sit a little away from the main entrance point.",

Many tourists bring their car here to teach their kids or friends driving as well. There is a helipad here too. Generally avoidable in the monsoon as the grounds become slushy.
