Be aware for someone in wheelchair.\nInside, we saw old paintings, wooden windows, and traditional rooms. There's also an exhibition room, and theatre room for film projection about the history of the venue.\nIt was a peaceful and special place to visit. Took many nice photos. A must-see in Leh!",

It's important because it was home to Ladakh's kings long ago. I loved walking through the dark rooms, imagining old stories.\nThe view of Leh from the Palace's roof was just breathtaking 🥹😇 and I felt so calm roaming through this palace.\nIt should be the first place on your list when you visit Leh.. Highly recommend it👍🏻👍🏻\nAmple Parking is there. You need to buy tickets from ticket counter situated at the entrance.",
