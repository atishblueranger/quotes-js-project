It’s important because it was home to Ladakh’s kings long ago. I loved walking through the dark rooms, imagining old stories.\nThe view of Leh from the Palace's roof was just breathtaking 🥹😇 and I felt so calm roaming through this palace.\nIt should be the first place on your list when you visit Leh.. Highly recommend it👍🏻👍🏻\nAmple Parking is there. You need to buy tickets from ticket counter situated at the entrance."

Several informative tables help to understand the history of the building, but they are terribly lit. The steps to the 9th floor are blocked. The audio visual hall is helpful. The small shrine is amazing."

              "reviewText": "Walking through Leh Palace felt like flipping through the pages of Ladakh’s royal past. The architecture is raw and rugged — more like a fortress than a palace — but there’s a quiet grandeur in its simplicity.\n\nAs you climb up through the narrow, wooden staircases, the views keep getting better. By the time I reached the top floor, the entire Leh town stretched out below, framed by snow-dusted mountains. The light was soft when I visited in the late afternoon — perfect for photos, especially if you enjoy playing with shadows and textures.\n\nThere’s not much inside in terms of decor, but if you pause and imagine what these walls have seen over centuries, it hits different. It’s more about the atmosphere than the interiors.\n\nTip: Combine your visit with sunset — the golden light on the palace walls and surrounding peaks is something else.\n\nA must-visit if you enjoy places that hold stories in their silence."

It gives you many chances to capture good shots on the way. We didn't go inside the palace but I am sure there will be much more to capture inside the palace. And from the top of the palace there will be an amazing view of leh city. Please keep the place clean when you visit 🙏"

              "reviewText": "Situated on a hilltop, Shanti Stupa offers a serene and breathtaking experience. The panoramic views are absolutely mesmerizing, making it the perfect spot to unwind and soak in nature’s beauty. The peaceful atmosphere is ideal for a quiet escape from the noise of everyday life.\n\nVisit during sunset—it’s less crowded, and the golden light creates a magical glow that’s perfect for photos. The stupa itself is beautifully maintained and exudes a calming presence. As the sun dips behind the mountains, the sky lights up with stunning colors, making the moment truly unforgettable. Whether you’re looking for a place to reflect or just want to enjoy a scenic view, Shanti Stupa delivers on both. The short climb up is worth it for the tranquility and the amazing clicks you’ll get. A must-visit spot for anyone looking to experience peace and natural beauty all in one place."

There’s free parking and a small ₹30 entry fee, and the person at the counter was genuinely kind. The souvenir shops near the entrance were helpful and sweet too.\n\nThere’s a clean, free washroom before the climb and resting spots along the way, which I really appreciated (I needed a few breaks 😅). The climb is gentle, no stairs, and the view at the top is stunning—so worth it.\n\nThe Shanti Stupa Café is beautiful, with friendly staff and no touristy overcharging—even for bottled water!\n\nSuch a peaceful place with a calm vibe all around.\n100/10 would recommend. :)"

              "reviewText": "I recently visited Shanti Stupa in Leh and had a truly memorable experience. The site, perched high on a hill, offered a serene atmosphere with very few tourists around, making it peaceful and uncrowded. This made it easy to capture beautiful, tranquil photos without crowds in the background—especially during sunset, which is the best time to visit for breathtaking views of Leh Valley and the glowing mountains.\n\nThe panoramic view from the stupa at sunset is absolutely stunning, with the changing hues of the sky casting a magical glow over the valley and stupa itself. The climb up is rewarding, but do arrive at least 30–45 minutes before sunset for the best light and plenty of time to enjoy the scenery."

There are benches all the way to take break during the hike. Not too much to hike but still tiring.\nOn top its beautiful with clear blue sky(we visited in the month of August) view is beautiful from top.\nIn Ladakh you feel the nature .\nEntry fee is 30/- Rs which is used in improving the place."

From the top, Leh lay quiet and still below, surrounded by layers of rugged mountains.\n\nThe climb up the stairs was a bit of a breath-tester at this altitude, but totally worth it. It’s one of those places where you don’t just take photos — you pause, breathe, and feel the silence.\n\nHighly recommended — go early, take your time, and let the place speak for itself."

The narrow streets are lined with cafes, souvenir shops, and Tibetan stalls.

You will find everything in this market starting from Tibetan food, ladakhi cuisine, and even north and south Indian food. People from different parts of India also come here to run shops taken on rent. Apart from food, you will find souvenir shops, clothing stores famous for Pashmina wool, Yak wool, Angora wool, silver ornaments and various other items. In fact, you will find a separate silver market here as Ladakhi people love to wear silver ornaments and a variety of stones. You will find ladies selling vegetables in front of the shops while sitting and knitting caps, socks, mufflers, scarfs and small toys. The market gets closed by 7:30 in winters, however during summers they close around 10:00 Ladakhi people are religious, and you will find people mostly following Buddhism, and Islam. There are various German Bakeries too, which are a must try. Tourists are sometimes looted for money while buying Pashmina products, therefore it's necessary that you have a previous knowledge about the quality and price or find a shop that sells you authentic goods at a reasonable and correct price. Rest if you love to see snowfall and snow covered mountains March possibly could be the best time, otherwise Leh tourism by default starts from April end or May first week. You can find wood fired pizzas here, also there are outlets of Nathus, and Karim's. And coming onto the Bank, you can find almost every Bank branch within the Leh Market. Overall, the place is sorted, and you only need to take care of the cold weather and the timings."

It’s a mix of the old and new — monks in maroon robes walking past cafés with acoustic music, locals selling handwoven pashminas beside shops offering momos and apple pies.\n\nI strolled through in the evening when the lights start to glow and the mountains turn blue in the background. The vibe? Laid-back, earthy, and a bit magical.\n\nPicked up some souvenirs — prayer flags, turquoise jewellery, and a handmade diary I’ll probably never write in but had to have. The food joints around the market are also worth checking out — try the butter tea if you’re feeling adventurous.\n\nIt’s not just a place to shop, but to linger, watch people, and soak in the rhythm of Leh."

It is peaceful if you wish to sit here for a while and refresh your soul and contemplate. There is a humongous kali goddess's statue, multi-armed, alongwith other deities, all with faces covered. The veils are removed only for two days during the local festival. Photography inside the temple is prohibited."
