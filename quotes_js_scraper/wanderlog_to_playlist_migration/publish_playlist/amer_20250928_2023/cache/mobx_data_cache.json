Built in the 17th century by Maharaja Man Singh I, this gate holds historical and spiritual significance.\n\nThe Ganesh Pol is named after the Hindu deity Lord Ganesh, who is revered as the remover of obstacles. The gate's name reflects its role in symbolically cleansing and purifying individuals before entering the Diwan-e-Khas, which served as a private audience hall for the king.\n\nThe gate is adorned with intricate frescoes, ornate carvings, and delicate lattice work, showcasing the exceptional craftsmanship of that era. Its architectural features include elephant trunks, lotus petals, and motifs of gods and goddesses, all intricately crafted in red sandstone and marble.\n\nThe Ganesh Pol not only served as a functional gateway but also as a visual representation of the ruler's power and grandeur. It's a stunning example of the fusion of Mughal and Rajput architectural styles, reflecting the cultural richness of the time.\n\nAs you pass through the Ganesh Pol, you step into a realm where history, artistry, and spirituality converge. The gate provides a glimpse into the opulence and sophistication of the Mughal and Rajput courts, offering a mesmerizing experience that lingers in the hearts of visitors.\n\n#GaneshPol #AmerFort #ArchitecturalSplendor #CulturalHeritage"

              "reviewText": "Sheesh Mahal (Mirror Palace) inside Amber Fort is truly a jewel of Jaipur’s royal heritage. The moment you step into this part of the fort, you’re greeted by a dazzling sight — walls and ceilings covered in thousands of tiny convex mirrors, intricate glass mosaics, and floral patterns inlaid with precious stones. Even a single candle or ray of sunlight transforms the whole hall into a shimmering galaxy of reflections.\n\nBuilt during the reign of Maharaja Man Singh in the 16th century and further enhanced by later rulers, Sheesh Mahal was used as a royal reception hall and private chamber for the queens. One of its most fascinating features is its ability to illuminate with minimal light — a single flame could create the effect of a starry night sky, allowing the royals to enjoy beauty and warmth without open flames.\n\nThe craftsmanship here is beyond words. Every mirror piece is hand-cut, and every floral motif is painted with natural colors, showing the unmatched skill of artisans from centuries ago. It’s not just architecture; it’s poetry in glass and stone.\n\nPhotography here is an absolute delight, but nothing compares to seeing it with your own eyes — the way light dances across the walls feels almost magical. The area is well-maintained, though due to preservation efforts, some parts are restricted for visitors, which is understandable given its delicate nature.\n\nIf you’re visiting Amber Fort, Sheesh Mahal is the heart of the experience. Take your time here, look closely at the details, and imagine the royal gatherings, music, and laughter that once filled this sparkling hall.\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"

Built in the 17th century by Mirza Raja Jai Singh, this magnificent structure was designed with a specific purpose: to allow the queen to experience a starry night sky without having to sleep in the open.\n​Its most striking feature is the intricate mirror work that covers the walls and ceilings.  Thousands of tiny, convex mirrors and colored glass pieces are meticulously arranged in complex floral and geometric patterns. This design creates a breathtaking effect where a single ray of light or the flame of a single candle is reflected countless times, illuminating the entire hall in a dazzling, star-like glow.\n​The exquisite craftsmanship is a testament to the skill of the artisans of that time, who painstakingly hand-cut and inlaid each piece. The architectural details, including the use of white marble and the blend of Islamic and Rajasthani motifs, demonstrate a sophisticated fusion of styles. This fusion makes the Sheesh Mahal a unique and captivating part of the Amer Fort complex.\n​While entry to the inner chamber is now restricted to preserve the delicate artwork, visitors can still admire its splendor from the outside. The Sheesh Mahal stands as a symbol of royal opulence, artistic excellence, and a king's profound love, making it a truly unforgettable sight."

The show was not as expected. It's very very basic. The coloured lighting is normal and the show is just like switching on and off lights and some shades of different lights with sound effects narrating a story. They can switch to laser based lights with effects to give a real feel to the audience. The ticket costs Rs 250 per head, can be booked through bookmyshow. The timing is 7-8 PM in English and 8-9 PM in Hindi. My overall experience is Rs 250 is not worth the show they present."

As you explore its majestic courtyards, intricate carvings, and mirror-studded halls, you can feel the grandeur of Rajput architecture. The blend of Hindu and Mughal styles is captivating, and the elephant rides or jeep rides up to the fort add to the adventure. Amer Fort is a must-visit for anyone who wants to experience Rajasthan’s regal history and culture."

As the sun set, we wandered into this beautiful mandir and were welcomed by local children, the priest, and the temple keepers. The energy here was profound,  it resonated with a mother’s love.\n\nThe temple itself was built in the early 1600s by Queen Kanakavati in memory of her son Jagat Singh. Dedicated to Krishna, Vishnu, and Meera Bai, it feels both intimate and timeless. The stone artistry is absolutely breathtaking, with carved details that seem alive in the evening light.\n\nThis temple resonates with the soul of place, a place to sink into and feel with your heart as you connect to all. One of the most meaningful discoveries of our Amber walk."

Built between 1599 and 1608 AD by Queen Kanakwati in memory of her son Jagat Singh, the temple holds historical and spiritual significance. It houses the same idol of Lord Krishna worshiped by Meera Bai, a devoted saint and poet, over 600 years ago. This idol was saved from destruction during the Mughal war with Mewar state and later brought to Amer.\n\nWhat makes this temple unique is that it is the only one in the world where idols of Lord Krishna and Meera Bai are worshiped together. Meera Bai considered Lord Krishna her spiritual husband, and the temple reflects their special bond. With its rich history and spiritual value, the Jagat Shiromani Temple is a monument of national importance and an essential part of Amer's heritage.\n\nThe Jagat Shiromani Temple is a masterpiece of Rajasthani architecture, with intricate carvings and stunning designs that transport you to a world of divine beauty. Its majestic structure, adorned with sculptures of trumpeting elephants and horses, seems to come alive with stories from mythological texts. The temple's strategic location on a small hill adds to its grandeur, making it a breathtaking sight to behold. As you step inside, the serene atmosphere and exquisite craftsmanship will leave you spellbound, making it a must-visit destination for anyone who appreciates art, history, and spirituality."

I highly recommend going early in the morning – the temperature is pleasant, and the crowd is minimal, making it perfect to explore the fort peacefully and click great photos without much disturbance.\n\nA small tip: do not book a jeep to reach the fort entrance. It’s completely unnecessary. The walk uphill is hardly 200-300 meters and very manageable, even in casual footwear.\n\nHiring a guide is a must if you want to understand the rich history and architectural details of the fort. The official guide charges are ₹400 for a group of 1-4 people and ₹600 for a group of 6-14. It’s definitely worth it for the added insight.\n\nOne important caution: avoid buying souvenirs from the shops inside the fort. They are extremely overpriced – you can find the same items outside the fort or in the local markets for 4-5 times cheaper.\n\nOverall, Amber Fort is stunning and offers a great start to your Jaipur trip if you plan wisely!"

The Sheesh Mahal is simply magical........the tiny mirrors sparkle beautifully, even in the faintest light.\nI’d highly recommend taking a local guide........they share fascinating stories, little-known facts, and bring the fort’s past to life in a way that signboards never can. The architecture is stunning........with a perfect blend of Rajput charm and Mughal elegance, and the views of Maota Lake from the top are picture-perfect.\nIf you can........arrive early to enjoy the elephant ride up to the fort........it’s a unique, royal touch to the experience. For a different vibe........there’s also a light and sound show in the evening that tells the fort’s history beautifully.\nAmber Fort isn’t just a sightseeing spot........it’s a walk through Rajasthan’s glorious past........and honestly........it’s one of Jaipur’s must-visits."

It’s highly recommended to hire a government-certified guide (around ₹400), as they give you a real understanding of the fort’s history and also help with the best photo spots. Exploring the fort takes about 1–2 hours including photo sessions.\n\nTo avoid the rush, reach by 10–11 am — on weekends, parking queues can stretch up to an hour. If you’re in a cab with a guide, they’ll usually take you through the village shortcut and park at the top, saving you a lot of time. Walking through the fort makes you appreciate how such massive structures were built centuries ago without modern machinery. An unforgettable experience and one of the highlights of Jaipur! If you want to save time, skip the ticket queue by booking through the OBMS app — it’s quick and hassle-free."

              "reviewText": "Hawa Mahal, or the “Palace of Winds,” is one of the most iconic landmarks in Jaipur. Built in 1799, this beautiful five-story palace made of red and pink sandstone is known for its 953 small windows, called jharokhas, designed to let cool air flow through the building.\n\nThe front of Hawa Mahal looks like a honeycomb or crown and is especially beautiful in the early morning light. Many people love taking photos from across the street, where several rooftop cafés offer the best views. From there, you can capture the full front of the palace—but please note, most cafés only allow photography if you buy something, like a cup of coffee or a snack. It’s a small price for a great experience and view.\n\nHawa Mahal was originally built so royal women could watch street life and festivals without being seen. Today, you can go inside and walk up the narrow ramps to enjoy beautiful views of the old city and nearby landmarks like Jantar Mantar.\n\nInside the palace, there are breezy passages, quiet courtyards, and a small museum. It doesn’t take much time to visit, but it’s full of charm and history.\n\nPlease also remember not to write or scratch on the walls. It’s a historic site, and we should help protect its beauty.\n\nHawa Mahal is a must-see in Jaipur—perfect for photography, culture, and a quick coffee with a royal view."

It’s not just a monument; it’s a breath, a glimpse into royal lives, and a haven of artistry.\nI’d recommend going early—beat the heat, catch the gentle light, and let yourself be still for a moment. Let the wind, the pink walls, and the stairs carry you a little away from today and into something tender and timeless."

Travel up the steep roadway in jeeps and then enter the main parade ground to see majestic elephants strolling round the perimeter. Through into the next huge open space to the hall of mirrors  and the gardens for the audience chamber. As you pass into the next area you move from one timescale into an earlier one which is less opulent and more defensive. You can spend hours there as there is so much to see, and the views from the top are fabulous."

The fort is easily reachable by bike with a smooth road and a short ride through scenic hills. The views from the top are just stunning especially during sunset when you can see the whole city of Jaipur. The fort itself has beautiful old architecture and a peaceful vibe. There are a few cafes inside to relax and enjoy snacks. The area is clean and well maintained"

The fort is open from 9:00 AM to 9:30 PM, giving you plenty of time to explore at your own pace.\n\nWe booked our own bike to get there — cost about ₹50 for parking, which is also fair considering the location and security.\n\nThe views from the top are absolutely stunning, especially during sunset. The fort itself is well-maintained and offers a mix of history, architecture, and panoramic city views. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Jaipur!\n\nWould recommend bringing water and wearing comfortable shoes, especially if you plan to walk around a lot. Overall, a memorable and budget-friendly experience. 👍"

The day view is breathtaking, but the night view with sparkling city lights is simply unforgettable.\nThe place does get hot during the day, so the best time to visit is from mid-August to February.\n\nA small tip: you’ll find monkeys around in the evening. Avoid carrying water bottles in your hand or teasing them – I had one snatch mine! Bring some extra water for them instead.\n\nOverall, an amazing spot for photography and one of the best city views I’ve ever seen. Highly recommend!"

The lake contains an island in the center, named Kesar Kyari Bagh. The island has a saffron garden, whose plants are said to have been planted by a Maharaja in the 15th century. The Dil-Aaram Bagh is situated on the northern end of the lake. There is no fee to visit the lake, but there is a fee to traverse upward (or ride an elephant) to enter the Amber Fort above.\n\nThe lake collects rain water flowing down from the nearby hills and was the main source of water for the Amber Fort and common people.

Its plans were based on his extensive knowledge of  cannons gleaned on his Kabul campaign in the 16th century as commander of Akbar’s army. It covers an area of  about 9000 square feet. The furnace and the drilling complex are its two major parts.The furnace its self is of the dimensions of 24 X 12 X 10 feet. It is an open hearth furnace where very high temperatures of about 1000 to 1200 degree Celsius can be attained.There are two charging windows and three chimneys.The hearth of the furnace is oval and made of fire bricks and clay.There are two opening in its ceiling which open into the chimneys above.The hearth has a small 2X2 feet window which opens into the pit outside so that the molten metal can fall into the mould and take its shape. A 72 feet long tunnel in the lower part of the furnace worked as a wind tunnel.\n\nThe Drilling Complex is an octagonal room with the ceiling at the height of 31 feet where the barrels of cannons moulded in the foundry were bored.  Four pairs of oxen were used to turn the levers of the machine which bored the barrel of a cannon in the making."

Built in 1799, this beautiful five-story palace made of red and pink sandstone is known for its 953 small windows, called jharokhas, designed to let cool air flow through the building.\n\nThe front of Hawa Mahal looks like a honeycomb or crown and is especially beautiful in the early morning light. Many people love taking photos from across the street, where several rooftop cafés offer the best views. From there, you can capture the full front of the palace—but please note, most cafés only allow photography if you buy something, like a cup of coffee or a snack. It’s a small price for a great experience and view.\n\nHawa Mahal was originally built so royal women could watch street life and festivals without being seen. Today, you can go inside and walk up the narrow ramps to enjoy beautiful views of the old city and nearby landmarks like Jantar Mantar.\n\nInside the palace, there are breezy passages, quiet courtyards, and a small museum. It doesn’t take much time to visit, but it’s full of charm and history.\n\nPlease also remember not to write or scratch on the walls. It’s a historic site, and we should help protect its beauty.\n\nHawa Mahal is a must-see in Jaipur—perfect for photography, culture, and a quick coffee with a royal view."

But if you really want to see it at its best, I recommend visiting after evening. When the lights turn on, Hawa Mahal looks even more stunning and magical. The whole place lights up and feels much more lively. Daytime visit is nice, but the evening view is definitely more special."

Although there were a few areas under construction, the overall ambiance was impressive.\n\nHowever, one thing that bothered me was the ticket pricing. The charges are quite high, with separate fees for different sections and museums inside the palace, which can be frustrating. Considering it’s a historical site, it would be great if the ticket prices were kept more affordable so everyone can appreciate and learn from this heritage."

The symmetrical steps and geometric design are truly fascinating — it's a great spot for photography and soaking in some quiet history. It's not as crowded as other tourist sites, which makes the experience even more peaceful.\n\nSome interesting stories about its historical use for water conservation and as a community gathering spot, especially for women in earlier times. You can't go down the steps anymore (as per current rules), but even from the top, the view is stunning.\n\nIn front of the kund, there’s an ancient temple that adds to the charm and spiritual feel of the place. It’s a small but beautifully carved temple, and visiting it makes the whole experience even more special. The peaceful atmosphere around both the stepwell and the temple gives a glimpse into the cultural and architectural richness of Rajasthan.\n\nIf you're in Jaipur, definitely make time for this — it's just a short drive from the Amer Fort!"

The fort is open from 9:00 AM to 9:30 PM, giving you plenty of time to explore at your own pace.\n\nWe booked our own bike to get there — cost about ₹50 for parking, which is also fair considering the location and security.\n\nThe views from the top are absolutely stunning, especially during sunset. The fort itself is well-maintained and offers a mix of history, architecture, and panoramic city views. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Jaipur!\n\nWould recommend bringing water and wearing comfortable shoes, especially if you plan to walk around a lot. Overall, a memorable and budget-friendly experience. 👍"

Avoid carrying water bottles in your hand or teasing them – I had one snatch mine! Bring some extra water for them instead.\n\nOverall, an amazing spot for photography and one of the best city views I’ve ever seen. Highly recommend!"

The architecture is stunning — a grand, beautifully detailed building that stands out in the heart of Jaipur.

The courtyards are stunning and the grounds are very clean. Cool tunnels to go up and lookout, and tunnels that lead to other forts (which are prohibited). We took the elephant ride up to the top, which was not the most comfortable ride but I feel like one has to do it. What’s really annoying, and unenjoyable is the constant hawkers. They start when you arrive, while you get on the elephant, and the ENTIRE trip up to the top-not taking NO for an answer!  Once at the top, we tipped our mahout and apparently that was not good enough for him-even tho a big sign said “no tipping”.  Stay away and say no to the photographers, they hounded us from the exit all the way to our car and even in our car!! We even had one show up the the restaurant when we walked out-simply RIDICULOUS!  All in all, the fort is beautiful and spacious and clean, it was the extraneous bits that were extremely annoying!"

The elephant ride is a part of the charm for sure and they are beautifully decorated. The hawkers are plentiful and super aggressive but if you don’t make eye contact they do leave you alone. We saw a few others engage in angry conversations so unless you have intent to buy, I’d suggest not looking or speaking to them. There are 120 working elephants here and it seemed like most of the visitors used them to climb to the fort. I think you can walk up but I’m not sure. Even on the way up the hawkers are shouting at you and part way there are a ton of photographers trying to get you to pose so they can harass you at the top to buy. The elephant drivers start reminding you to tip as soon as you enter the courtyard and just a few rupees will suffice. The complex is huge and we would recommend a guide to understand what you are seeing. The section of mirrored walls is spectacular and there are many spots throughout the complex where amazing pictures can be taken. Our guide also suggested we peek into the keyholes of a few sections that were closed off and we did see some amazing things in these areas not currently open.  Lots to see here and I’m sure the 1.5 hours we spent just scratched the surface. Student charges is just 10 INR."

We were served by Mr. Pankaj. He is very polite and friendly. And the best part is he is an excellent photographer\nThe food is delectable. We ordered honey chilli potato , Mojiti and Cafe Latte and enjoyed our evening at the roof top.\n\nA must visit if you want some great food and beautiful pictures."

So if you are looking for a good view of Hawa Mahal and take some nice photos, this is the ideal place. The food is good and tasty but a bit pricey due to the fact for the amazing view 😜. There could be a waiting time during peak season so be prepared for it. The service is a bit slow. The staff are nice and polite but it seems they have less staff to manage the peak crowd. If you visit Jaipur for vacation then this place can be on your bucket list for a relaxed lunch with an amazing view of Hawa Mahal."

I stumbled upon it while exploring the area and was instantly drawn in by the rooftop seating and the scenic view and let me tell you, it did not disappoint. Sitting on the terrace with a direct view of Hawa Mahal was surreal. Whether you're there during the golden hours of sunset or at night, the view is breathtaking.\n\nBeyond the view, the cafe has a chilled-out vibe with quirky decor and a laid-back atmosphere that makes it a great spot to relax. The staff were friendly and attentive, and the service was smooth. As for the food, it was genuinely good. I tried some Chinese and Indian items, and everything tasted fresh and flavorful. The portion sizes were generous, and the pricing was reasonable considering the location. It's the kind of place where you can spend hours—whether you're catching up with friends, or just soaking in the Jaipur charm. If you are in the city, especially around the old town, Tattoo Cafe is definitely worth a stop. It’s not just a cafe, it’s an experience with a view."

We had heard about the great view of the Hawa Mahal, and it absolutely lived up to the hype.\n\nTo reach the café, you climb a number of stairs lined with small shops on either side, spread across different levels. Just before the final staircase, there's someone at the entrance charging a small fee, which is redeemable as a voucher for food and drinks—so it felt totally fair.\n\nThe café is spread over two levels: the first floor is indoors, offering a cool retreat from the sun, while the rooftop terrace on the second floor is where the magic happens. With parasols for shade and an unbeatable view of the Hawa Mahal right across the street, it’s a great spot to relax and soak in the city’s energy from above.\n\nWe liked it so much, we ended up going twice. Between us, we tried the coffee, masala chai, pancakes, and naan—all were solid and hit the spot, though the view is definitely the highlight.\n\nA cozy, atmospheric place to rest your feet, grab a bite, and enjoy one of Jaipur’s most iconic views."

They do charge a cover fee of 250 rupees per person which is redeemed against your order- I think this is completely fair as otherwise it would be overrun with tourists wanting a photo.  Our waiter, Pankaj, was very polite, attentive and friendly, as well as being a great photographer! He kindly took photos for us at the end of our meal.  The food was lovely.  We had such an enjoyable experience in this gem of a cafe.\nThe following day I visited and the staff helped me with a little problem- thank you so much!

I highly recommend going early in the morning – the temperature is pleasant, and the crowd is minimal, making it perfect to explore the fort peacefully and click great photos without much disturbance.\n\nA small tip: do not book a jeep to reach the fort entrance. It’s completely unnecessary. The walk uphill is hardly 200-300 meters and very manageable, even in casual footwear.\n\nHiring a guide is a must if you want to understand the rich history and architectural details of the fort. The official guide charges are ₹400 for a group of 1-4 people and ₹600 for a group of 6-14. It’s definitely worth it for the added insight.\n\nOne important caution: avoid buying souvenirs from the shops inside the fort. They are extremely overpriced – you can find the same items outside the fort or in the local markets for 4-5 times cheaper.\n\nOverall, Amber Fort is stunning and offers a great start to your Jaipur trip if you plan wisely!"

The Sheesh Mahal is simply magical........the tiny mirrors sparkle beautifully, even in the faintest light.\nI’d highly recommend taking a local guide........they share fascinating stories, little-known facts, and bring the fort’s past to life in a way that signboards never can. The architecture is stunning........with a perfect blend of Rajput charm and Mughal elegance, and the views of Maota Lake from the top are picture-perfect.\nIf you can........arrive early to enjoy the elephant ride up to the fort........it’s a unique, royal touch to the experience. For a different vibe........there’s also a light and sound show in the evening that tells the fort’s history beautifully.\nAmber Fort isn’t just a sightseeing spot........it’s a walk through Rajasthan’s glorious past........and honestly........it’s one of Jaipur’s must-visits."

It’s highly recommended to hire a government-certified guide (around ₹400), as they give you a real understanding of the fort’s history and also help with the best photo spots. Exploring the fort takes about 1–2 hours including photo sessions.\n\nTo avoid the rush, reach by 10–11 am — on weekends, parking queues can stretch up to an hour. If you’re in a cab with a guide, they’ll usually take you through the village shortcut and park at the top, saving you a lot of time. Walking through the fort makes you appreciate how such massive structures were built centuries ago without modern machinery. An unforgettable experience and one of the highlights of Jaipur! If you want to save time, skip the ticket queue by booking through the OBMS app — it’s quick and hassle-free."

Visiting Khole Ke Hanumanji offers not just divine blessings but also a beautiful escape from the city’s hustle. The atmosphere is calm. Don’t miss walking a little further uphill to the Vaishno Devi Mandir. It's a perfect spot for those who enjoy devotion and nature both.\nAnother special thing here is that many devotees organise Dal Baati Churma bhandaras. If you're lucky, you might get to enjoy a delicious Rajasthani meal after your darshan."

The massive Hanuman idol here exudes a powerful presence, and devotees often speak of a deep sense of peace after darshan.\n\nA major highlight is the cleanliness and systematic management of the premises, despite being a popular religious spot.

While it was lovely to see all of the monkeys roaming around, for a popular tourist attraction the temple was not well looked after and there was trash everywhere, arguably the most littered temple I’ve been to so far in India. Quite sad to see all of the monkeys and other animals eating the rubbish that was in the river, which ruined the entire experience. The people that work here are only there to get your money, they commented that the rubbish situation was awful but had no incentive to clear up. There were no bins anywhere either, which would have significantly helped. There is an additional charge to take pictures, which costs more than the entrance ticket and is an outright scam!. Hope someone with authority sees this comment and decides to take action. Very disappointing."

We were the only tourists and it was a magnificent sight. The sunrise was beautiful and the swarm of monkeys that suddenly came was cool. The monkeys were adorable and very playful. I can recommend this place to anyone that want a great experience!\nThe cost is 50 INR for each camera you bring. Same price for foreigners as for locals.\nWord of warning: The locals will try to get you into their shrines there is scattered around and then pressure you for money."
