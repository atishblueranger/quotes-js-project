            "text": "Hawa Mahal, or the “Palace of Winds,” is one of the most iconic landmarks in Jaipur. Built in 1799, this beautiful five-story palace made of red and pink sandstone is known for its 953 small windows, called jharokhas, designed to let cool air flow through the building.\n\nThe front of Hawa Mahal looks like a honeycomb or crown and is especially beautiful in the early morning light. Many people love taking photos from across the street, where several rooftop cafés offer the best views. From there, you can capture the full front of the palace-but please note, most cafés only allow photography if you buy something, like a cup of coffee or a snack. It's a small price for a great experience and view.\n\nHawa Mahal was originally built so royal women could watch street life and festivals without being seen. Today, you can go inside and walk up the narrow ramps to enjoy beautiful views of the old city and nearby landmarks like Jantar Mantar.\n\nInside the palace, there are breezy passages, quiet courtyards, and a small museum. It doesn't take much time to visit, but it's full of charm and history.\n\nPlease also remember not to write or scratch on the walls. It's a historic site, and we should help protect its beauty.\n\nHawa Mahal is a must-see in Jaipur-perfect for photography, culture, and a quick coffee with a royal view.",

I highly recommend going early in the morning – the temperature is pleasant, and the crowd is minimal, making it perfect to explore the fort peacefully and click great photos without much disturbance.\n\nA small tip: do not book a jeep to reach the fort entrance. It's completely unnecessary. The walk uphill is hardly 200-300 meters and very manageable, even in casual footwear.\n\nHiring a guide is a must if you want to understand the rich history and architectural details of the fort. The official guide charges are ₹400 for a group of 1-4 people and ₹600 for a group of 6-14. It's definitely worth it for the added insight.\n\nOne important caution: avoid buying souvenirs from the shops inside the fort. They are extremely overpriced – you can find the same items outside the fort or in the local markets for 4-5 times cheaper.\n\nOverall, Amber Fort is stunning and offers a great start to your Jaipur trip if you plan wisely!",

The architecture is stunning........with a perfect blend of Rajput charm and Mughal elegance, and the views of Maota Lake from the top are picture-perfect.\nIf you can........arrive early to enjoy the elephant ride up to the fort........it's a unique, royal touch to the experience.

The fort itself is well-maintained and offers a mix of history, architecture, and panoramic city views. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Jaipur!\n\nWould recommend bringing water and wearing comfortable shoes, especially if you plan to walk around a lot.

The courtyards are stunning and the grounds are very clean. Cool tunnels to go up and lookout, and tunnels that lead to other forts (which are prohibited). We took the elephant ride up to the top, which was not the most comfortable ride but I feel like one has to do it. What's really annoying, and unenjoyable is the constant hawkers. They start when you arrive, while you get on the elephant, and the ENTIRE trip up to the top-not taking NO for an answer!  Once at the top, we tipped our mahout and apparently that was not good enough for him-even tho a big sign said “no tipping”.  Stay away and say no to the photographers, they hounded us from the exit all the way to our car and even in our car!! We even had one show up the the restaurant when we walked out-simply RIDICULOUS!
