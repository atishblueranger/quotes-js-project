Tucked away on a hilltop, this small yet charming temple dedicated to Lord Ganesha isn't just a place of worship—it’s a window to the heavens.\n\nThe first thing that strikes you as you arrive is the sheer beauty of the surroundings. The atmosphere is peaceful, the air crisp and clean, and the views—absolutely mesmerizing. From here, you get a panoramic view of the lush green hills and valleys that define the landscape of Gangtok. But what truly sets Ganesh Tok apart is the majestic view of Mount Kanchenjunga, the third-highest peak in the world. When the sky is clear and the early morning sun begins to rise, the snow-capped peaks of Kanchenjunga glow in golden hues, creating a picture-perfect moment that stays etched in your memory forever.\n\nThe best time to visit Ganesh Tok is between March and June, especially during the early morning hours of 7 AM to 9 AM. During this time, the skies are generally clear, and the light is perfect for photography. The serenity of the place, combined with the soft chants from the temple and the cool mountain breeze, creates a truly spiritual and calming experience.\n\nApart from the views, the area around the temple is well-maintained and offers a peaceful vibe."

This sacred stupa is one of the most significant landmarks of Buddhist culture in the region and offers a deeply spiritual and serene experience.\n\nAs I approached the stupa, I was immediately struck by the peaceful and positive atmosphere that surrounds the area. The chorten (stupa) is beautifully maintained, and its golden dome shines gracefully against the backdrop of Sikkim’s natural beauty. The place is surrounded by 108 prayer wheels, which visitors can spin while walking around the structure—a meditative and calming activity that added to the overall spiritual vibe.\n\nThe surroundings are very clean, quiet, and well-organized, creating a sense of peace and tranquility. You can really feel the spiritual energy of the place, making it ideal not only for followers of Buddhism but for anyone seeking a moment of calm and reflection.\n\nDo Drul Chorten is a must-visit if you're in Gangtok. It’s not just a tourist spot, but a place where you can genuinely connect with inner peace and take in the positive energy that flows throughout the area. I left feeling refreshed, grounded, and grateful for the experience."

Nestled on a hilltop, this spot offers a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding mountains and valleys, making it a perfect place to relax and soak in the beauty of Sikkim.\nAs we reached the viewpoint, we were welcomed by a cool breeze and clear skies. The view was absolutely mesmerizing – the lush green hills, scattered clouds, and distant mountain peaks made it feel like a dream. We took our time clicking photos, trying to capture the incredible scenery and moments together.\nOne of the most fun parts of our visit was dressing up in the traditional Sikkimese attire available at the viewpoint. Wearing the vibrant local dress and taking pictures gave us a sense of the local culture and made the experience even more memorable. It was exciting to see ourselves in colorful traditional clothing against such a beautiful backdrop.\nThe place had a peaceful vibe, and though it was a popular spot, it didn’t feel overcrowded. We enjoyed spending time together, laughing, taking photos, and just enjoying the moment. Tashi View Point is a must-visit during a trip to Gangtok, especially if you love nature and scenic views. It offered us a perfect blend of culture, fun, and stunning natural beauty. Visiting with friends made it even more special – a day I’ll always remember fondly"

My experience was nothing short of extraordinary, and I felt deeply connected to the divine.\n\nAs I climbed the stairs leading to the temple, I felt a sense of serenity wash over me. The temple's serene ambiance, coupled with the stunning natural beauty of the surrounding hills, created a sense of tranquility that was hard to ignore.\n\nThe temple itself is a beautiful structure that exudes a sense of peace and calm. The idol of Lord Hanuman, the revered deity, is imposing yet benevolent, and I felt a deep sense of connection to the divine as I offered my prayers.\n\nWhat struck me most about Hanuman Tok was the sense of community that pervaded the temple premises. Devotees from all walks of life had gathered to offer their prayers, and the sense of camaraderie was palpable.\n\nAs I stood there, taking in the breathtaking views of the Himalayas, I felt grateful for the experience. Hanuman Tok is more than just a temple - it's a spiritual haven that offers a sense of peace, calm, and connection to the divine.\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Gangtok, I highly recommend a visit to Hanuman Tok.

Nestled at an altitude of about 7,200 feet, Hanuman Tok is not just a temple—it’s a peaceful haven that offers breathtaking views of the surrounding Himalayan ranges and a serene atmosphere for inner reflection.\nI visited with my friends, and together we spent around two hours there, soaking in the divine energy and scenic beauty. The drive up to the temple was beautiful, with winding roads surrounded by lush greenery and crisp mountain air. Upon reaching, we were greeted by the majestic statue of Lord Hanuman, standing tall and powerful, instilling a deep sense of peace and devotion.\nThe temple complex is immaculately maintained by the Indian Army, which adds to its charm and sanctity. The panoramic view of Gangtok city from the temple grounds is absolutely stunning, and the quiet environment made it perfect for prayer and meditation. We spent our time exploring the temple, offering prayers, and simply sitting in silence to feel the divine connection.\nBeing there was an emotional and uplifting experience for me. As a big devotee of Lord Hanuman, I felt truly blessed and spiritually recharged. It was a memorable journey shared with close friends, and Hanuman Tok now holds a special place in my heart. I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking peace, devotion, and natural beauty."

              "reviewText": "During our trip to Gangtok, my friends and I visited the serene Enchey Monastery, a peaceful and spiritually enriching experience nestled amid the hills. The monastery, which belongs to the Nyingma order of Vajrayana Buddhism, exudes a calm atmosphere with its vibrant prayer flags, intricate murals, and the soft hum of chants in the background. Surrounded by lush greenery and offering panoramic views of Gangtok, the location itself feels sacred and removed from the hustle of the town.\nThe main prayer hall is beautifully adorned with traditional Tibetan Buddhist art and statues, providing a glimpse into the region’s rich spiritual heritage. The monks were respectful and welcoming, allowing us to quietly observe their rituals without intrusion.\nOutside the monastery, there were several food stalls and small eateries catering to tourists. While the food options were decent—ranging from local momos and thukpa to more common snacks like noodles and tea—the prices were slightly on the higher side, likely due to the remote location and tourist traffic. However, the taste and freshness of the food made up for the cost to some extent.\nOverall, Enchey Monastery is a must-visit spot in Gangtok, especially for those seeking a spiritual retreat or an opportunity to experience Sikkimese culture."

A good amount of walking was required but it only enhanced the vibe. There is one thing though, the initial walk till the parking is actually too much so I would suggest that you take your vehicle till the parking and walk the rest. The ride from the main entry to the parking is extremely aesthetic and fun. I wouldn’t say that it’s a must visit, however I would recommend it to anyone looking for a short trek which gives a very natural essence. Lastly, I actually experienced some hail fall along side the rain. Even though it hindered my visit to the Zoo, it was fun indeed."

At the entrance, you can find local vendors for a quick snack. Local dress for rentals for amazing photo sessions. Zoo is quite widespread and you will need to walk and climb quite a bit, so be prepared beforehand for a mini hike. Animal collection is wonderful, which mostly includes endangered species. Most difficult animal to capture on camera is definitely the wolf, unlucky for 4 times. White tiger and the red pandas are the gems of this zoo. You have a sightseeing tower near the top for amazing views and selfies. You can also get snacks at certain points. Overall a great experience."

You can also buy some seeds, wear a traditional dress on rent and take some pictures. But, most importantly, very few people come here, which will give a calm experience. Great place for nature lovers. ❤️"

Tucked away in a beautifully forested area, this place felt like a slice of peace and power combined. As soon as I entered, I could hear the distant roar of the waterfall—it instantly made me excited.\nThe entry fee is ₹50 per person, which I found very affordable for what the place offers. There's also parking available right near the entrance—convenient and spacious. The exact parking fee might depend on the vehicle, but it was reasonably priced i e ₹20-50\nBefore even entering the main waterfall area, there are several small shops and food stalls. I found some really good local snacks and souvenirs here, which added to the experience. It's perfect if you're looking to grab a bite or shop a little before heading in. Inside, the area is very well maintained. There are man-made walkways, charming bridges, and statues representing Sikkimese shamanic traditions—which made the place both cultural and educational. The waterfall itself was absolutely breathtaking. Standing near it, feeling the mist on my face, was so refreshing. It’s also a great photo spot, with greenery all around and the powerful water cascading down. Overall, I had a fantastic time at Ban Jhakri Waterfall. It’s a perfect mix of nature, culture, and relaxation—ideal for families, couples, or solo travelers. I’d definitely recommend including it in your Gangtok itinerary."

As we stepped inside, the air resonated with the deep, rhythmic chanting of monks, their voices weaving a tranquil mantra that instantly calmed the soul. Among them were young novice monks, their presence adding a touching innocence to the sacred atmosphere. The spacious premises, surprisingly expansive for a hilltop setting, exuded warmth and harmony, inviting visitors to linger and reflect.The view from the monastery was breathtaking, with rolling landscapes stretching far below, offering a perfect backdrop for contemplation. A massive flag stood proudly at the center of the courtyard, fluttering gently in the breeze, symbolizing resilience and unity. The architecture blended simplicity with grandeur, creating an environment that felt both humble and awe-inspiring.Spending time here was rejuvenating—whether meditating, strolling the grounds, or simply soaking in the serene vibes.

The ride offers stunning aerial views of Gangtok city, lush valleys, and on a clear day, even glimpses of the majestic Kanchenjunga. It's a short but memorable 15–20 minute round trip, connecting three stations with spacious cable cars. The experience is peaceful and perfect for both families and solo travelers. Go early to avoid long queues and don’t forget your camera—every moment is photo-worthy! Highly recommended for anyone visiting Gangtok."

It's a view to behold from a cable car, and so it's an opportunity indeed. However the path chosen is rather too far from the view that you'd probably need a professional camera to capture the beauty that extends till the curtain of fog."

There was even a monthly pass option, while I just took a one way ride.\n\nThe boarding process is a bit unusual. everyone waits at ground level first, then again at the ropeway station.\n\nBut the view from up here is absolutely stunning. Riding slowly uphill along the steep slopes of Gangtok, Can enjoy a unique view of the busy streets and lush green forests. A beautiful experience."

As a tourist, this is a great way to get a bird’s-eye view of the city and the surrounding hills. The ride isn’t very long (about 10–15 minutes round trip), but the views are totally worth it — you get to see Gangtok town, the flowing river below, and on a clear day, even the snow-covered peaks in the distance.\n\nThe ropeway has three stations, but most people do the round trip from the middle station. It does get a bit crowded, especially in peak season, so be prepared for a short wait. The cabins can feel a bit cramped, but the overall ride is smooth and safe.\n\nTicket prices are reasonable, and it’s a great photo opportunity. I’d recommend going around late afternoon — the light is perfect and the city looks beautiful from above.\n\nA nice, quick addition to your Gangtok sightseeing list!"

              "reviewText": "Too many people in a single mountain cable car ride. It looks like you are in Mumbai local train during rush hour.....Ropeway operators should take few people in a ride, so that the actual feel of the ropeway ride can be experienced or if possible to them, the other way is to have small 3-4 cars on a single rope. With these small cars the total passenger capacity will be the same as that of in a big car and the load on the rope will be the same. Switching the side while returning so that we will get other side view is not a good option. Though the views are better seen from mountain cable car, but you can't get 360 degree view in a car as it is totally packed with people. You will get only one side view. This is disappointing as a tourist."

It has a “ I ♥️BRO”(Border Road Organisation) structure as well, which definitely looks like a tourist attraction. However, when it comes to waterfalls I think there a places that a definitely better than this and I wouldn’t recommend anyone to solely visit this place. If it’s coming on the way to somewhere then surely have a look and enjoy the place. 😇"

The waterfall isn't massive but makes up for it with its cool mountain freshness and photogenic cascades. The viewing area is well-maintained with railings for safety, though the steps can get slippery.\n\nGood for: A 30-minute stop to stretch your legs, enjoy the mist, and snap some pictures. Best visited en route to other attractions"

              "reviewText": "Tucked away just a few kilometers from the chaos (read: charm) of Gangtok, the Bakthang Waterfall* is like that soft-spoken friend at a party who doesn’t say much… but steals the spotlight anyway. Unlike the thundering drama of its flashier cousin Ban Jhakri, Bakthang whispers its way down a mossy cliff, offering serenity with a splash and a side of misty magic.\n\nFirst Things First – Where Are We?\nLocated along the North Sikkim Highway, a breezy 3–4 km from Gangtok city center, Bakthang is often the first stop on the North Sikkim tour circuit. And trust me, it's a stellar opening act. The name \"Bakthang\" comes from the Lepcha words: \"Bak\" (forest) and \"Thang\" (field) – so yes, it’s literally a field of forest, and it looks every bit as enchanting.\n\nThe Scene – Water, Weaves, and Wow!\nThe waterfall, while not towering in height, is wide and graceful – think chiffon saree in a wind tunnel. Cascading down a rocky wall blanketed with ferns, it lands in a shallow basin, perfect for a quick foot dip or an impromptu dance number (yes, people *do* that).\n\nLocal adventure lovers also run a zipline across the face of the falls. If you’ve ever wanted to channel your inner Tarzan with a GoPro, this is your moment.\n\nAnd guess what? Right near the falls, locals offer traditional Sikkimese attire photoshoots. Get dressed like royalty from the mountains and click pics with the falls as your royal backdrop – 100% filmy, 200% fun.\n\nFun-Sized Facts:\n- Bakthang is fed by the Ratey Chu river, which also supplies water to much of Gangtok.\n- The waterfall is not too crowded, which makes it perfect for those looking to dodge touristy chaos.\n- It’s accessible even for senior citizens or folks who don’t want to trek a mile just to see a splash.\n\nMy Personal Verdict:\nBakthang isn’t about grandeur. It’s about grace. A serene, postcard-worthy pitstop that offers a mix of culture, calm, and quirky photo-ops."

While walking down the MG Marg of Gangtok, I was suddenly attracted by the colours and size of this huge temple and hence I decided to pay a visit. At first I thought that the entrance was by the Pizza Hut side, but the actual entrance is towards the MG Marg road side. The main temple is upstairs. On the ground floor there are a few more temples of Shiva, Jagannath and others. Highly recommended to visit while exploring Gangtok.🙏🏻"

The property is stunning—peaceful, beautifully maintained, and full of charm. But what truly made our stay special was the incredible hospitality of the staff.\n\nAfter we checked out, I realized I had forgotten one of my shoes in the room. I called the hotel, and they responded immediately. To my surprise, they had found it and promptly couriered it to me, perfectly packed. I received it today, and they didn’t even ask for any extra payment for the courier. That level of care and service is rare!\n\nThank you, Mayfair team, for your warmth, professionalism, and thoughtful gesture. Highly recommend this place to anyone visiting Gangtok!"

              "reviewText": "A Mixed Experience at a Promising Property\n\nAs a seasoned traveler with a keen eye for detail and service quality, I recently stayed at this luxury hotel near Gangtok. While the property shows significant potential in terms of infrastructure and location, several service-related issues made the experience less than ideal. Below is a detailed breakdown for fellow travelers considering this hotel.\n\n⸻\n\nPros:\n\n1. Room Quality:\nThe rooms were exceptional — spacious, spotlessly clean, and elegantly furnished. The bed was comfortable, and the in-room amenities reflected the standards expected of a premium property. Housekeeping was consistent and professional throughout the stay.\n\n2. Location:\nThe hotel is located approximately 10 kilometers from Gangtok city, which may not be ideal for those seeking close proximity to the town center. However, the location itself is peaceful, scenic, and secure — offering a welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle.\n\n3. Food (Buffet Options):\nThe buffet spread was extensive and well-curated with multiple choices catering to varied tastes. The quality and taste of the food met expectations for a luxury stay, and special mention goes to the live counters and local dishes on offer.\n\n4. Amenities:\nThe property features a well-maintained swimming pool and a relaxing spa, both of which enhanced the stay. Facilities were clean and met the expectations of a high-end resort.\n\n⸻\n\nCons:\n\n1. Service & Staff Behaviour:\nUnfortunately, the most disappointing aspect of the stay was the service, particularly at the reception. The staff were unprofessional and inconsistent — with different personnel providing conflicting information about check-in procedures and hotel policies. Requests were met with indifference, and responsiveness was severely lacking. For a luxury hotel, such lapses in guest service are unacceptable and reflect poorly on management.\n\n2. Buffet Service Staff:\nWhile the food itself was impressive, the service at the buffet was chaotic and inattentive. Repeated requests to refill empty buffet items were ignored. The lack of proactive service was frustrating, especially during peak meal times. Only one staff member, Govardhan, stood out for his courteous and efficient attitude — the rest of the team appeared disengaged and indifferent.\n\n3. Value for Money:\nIn terms of infrastructure, room quality, and amenities, the hotel does justify its price point. However, when factoring in the poor staff behavior and lack of responsive service, the overall value proposition diminishes significantly. A luxury property must consistently deliver on service to justify premium rates — something this hotel currently fails to do.\n\n⸻\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nThis property holds strong potential with its elegant rooms, tranquil location, and good food. However, the lack of professional, guest-oriented service significantly mars the overall experience. For travelers prioritizing comfort and amenities, it may still be a viable choice — but those who value consistent and courteous service may find themselves disappointed.\n\nRating: 3/5 — Great property, poorly managed."

We placed an order almost 2 hours ago, and despite multiple follow-ups, we still haven’t received anything. When we finally called to check on the delay, the response we got was, “We are a bit busy.”\nThis kind of casual attitude towards guest service is unacceptable, especially from a reputed hotel. We understand that things can get hectic, but guests should at least be informed and treated with courtesy. Sadly, this poor service overshadowed our stay."

Known for its Tibetan specialties like momos, shyaphale, and thukpa (or thumpa), it’s a cozy spot that draws both tourists and locals.\n\nWe tried a few of their signature dishes. The momos were decent but didn’t quite live up to the hype — they lacked the punch of flavor we were expecting. However, the thumpa completely won us over with its rich and comforting taste — perfect for the chilly weather. The shyaphale was another highlight: crispy and well-fried on the outside with a generous, flavorful chicken stuffing inside.\n\nOverall, Taste of Tibet is a good place to stop by if you’re exploring MG Marg and craving some Tibetan comfort food. It's definitely worth a visit for the thumpa and shyaphale!"

I ordered fried rice, chicken momos, and a chicken item – everything was delicious and freshly made. The momos were juicy and full of flavour, and the spicy carrot pickle on the side added a perfect kick. The fried rice was well-seasoned and filling.\n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was casual and lively. It’s located right on the main MG Road, so it’s always buzzing with people. Inside, the place had a simple, no-fuss setup but felt warm and welcoming. It had that local, authentic feel which made the eating experience even better. Service was quick, and the staff were polite, even during the busy hours.\n\nDefinitely a great spot to enjoy some tasty Tibetan-style food while soaking in the local vibe of Gangtok."

But after surveying the market, we got to know that vehicle is available and we arranged by our own.\nAnd today was our final check out and we made the due payment yesterday night.\nThey were supposed to provide Innova for today's NJP drop (which I have already made the payment) and they told that they arranged the car and it'll come for pick up at today 7 am.\nBut from 6 am, the manager (Rony) of the hotel was unavailable and was not receiving calls. We waited till 9 am. Then we arranged car by our own.\n\nSo, be alert from these fraud people."

              "reviewText": "I recently had the misfortune of staying at Bamboo grove Retreat, and I must say it was one of the worst hotel experiences I have ever had. From the moment we checked in until the time we left, our stay was marred by the poor construction of the hotel, particularly on the second floor where our room was located.\n\nThe entire hotel is built with flimsy structures, which becomes abundantly clear once you step foot on the second floor. The moment someone walks on the third floor, it feels as if the entire ceiling is about to collapse. The incessant shaking and creaking of the floor above made it impossible to relax or get a good night's sleep. I felt like I was constantly on edge, fearing that the whole floor might come crashing down at any moment.\n\nNot only did the shaky construction make our stay incredibly uncomfortable, but it also affected the overall ambiance of the hotel. The constant noise from the creaking floors and walls created a distracting and unpleasant atmosphere, disrupting any chance of tranquility or relaxation. It was impossible to escape the feeling that the hotel was simply not safe or structurally sound.\n\nAdditionally, the management's response to our concerns was less than satisfactory. When we brought up the issue of the shaky construction, the staff seemed dismissive and uninterested in addressing our complaints. It felt as if they were aware of the problem but had no intention of rectifying it. Such indifference and lack of concern for guest satisfaction is simply unacceptable.\n\nMoreover, the problems with the construction were not limited to the noise and instability. The room itself had various issues, including outdated furnishings, uncomfortable beds, and a lack of basic amenities. The cleanliness of the room was also questionable, with stains on the carpet and a musty odor that lingered throughout our stay.\n\nOverall, my experience at Bamboo Retreat was incredibly disappointing. The poorly constructed wooden building, especially on the second floor, made for an uncomfortable and nerve-wracking stay. The lackluster response from the management and the overall subpar condition of the room only added to our dissatisfaction. I would strongly advise against staying at this hotel unless you enjoy sleepless nights and a constant sense of unease."

The hotel's service, location, and room quality surpassed all my expectations.\n\nFirst and foremost, the hotel's location near MG MARG was perfect. It was conveniently situated in the heart of the city, making it easy for me to explore the local attractions, restaurants, and shops. I didn't have to travel far to experience the vibrant energy of the area.\n\nThe room at VSTM Bamboo Grove was exceptionally clean and spacious. The attention to detail in maintaining cleanliness was evident throughout my stay. The room was tastefully decorated and provided ample space for relaxation and comfort.\n\nBut what truly made my stay memorable was the remarkable service provided by the hotel staff, especially Tanmay da, Pritam da, and the rest of the team. Their warm and friendly demeanor made me feel welcome from the moment I stepped into the hotel. They were always available to assist with any requests or inquiries I had, going above and beyond to ensure my stay was enjoyable.\n\nTheir professionalism and genuine care for the guests were evident in every interaction. Their recommendations for local attractions and dining options were spot-on, allowing me to make the most of my time in the city.\n\nI highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a memorable and comfortable stay in Gangtok."

And it took  me  other half an hour for the soup that i too had to ask for it . Although im fine waiting and i literally dont mind it.To me when it comes to delicious  food\nI would wait and i know the place does serves the best . But they placed me a longitudnal cracked soup bowl and on top of it had a black  flake wich looked like a stains of a sticky pan.\nAnd when i said it to the manager he just smiled. And so thinking about nothing i moved on but later i had forgotten my sweater out there but when i reached out there to get it back it was thrown under the table n was my sweater was all dusty. Didnt know what to do so just said thanks and left the place. Anyways the foods great ."

We also had Pork Momos  which was really good but took a long time coming since they said they make it fresh to order. We wanted a second plate but would have to wait again. The momos  unlike other pork momos  in Gangtok are thin skinned with less fat slivers and more or red mince meat which was to my liking.\nOf course the hot momo chutney and broth was there as accompaniment.\nThe fresh lime soda was soothing and was beautifully decorated but the beer we ordered was room temperature even though we had asked for a chilled one. The waiter just opened it without letting us check the same!\nThe window seats offer a beautiful breezy view of the Ranka area but the seats further inside could get stuffy as there was no fan and we had visited on a humid July afternoon.\n\nThe service is a tad slow but the staff generally polite and courteous. Overall a fair to good experience dining here though I wouldn't visit it again. It is located in Deorali a lot further from the city centre so unless you have some work there or have come specifically to eat at Porky's it seems a bit out of the way.\nAlso parking would be an issue here so its recommended to take a shared taxi."

The sight of the dish sizzling away, accompanied by the sound of the savory juices bubbling, creates an anticipation that is unmatched.\n\nIn conclusion, Porky's sizzler plates are a must-try for anyone looking to indulge in a culinary sensation.

The staff cannot be appreciated enough as they were so helpful with our luggage. One requirement in the future would be a bigger bathroom.

You can buy groceries from shops nearby. If you have your own vehicle, parking may be difficult. They can arrange food for you as well. Clean and neat rooms with clean bathrooms, but don,t expect luxury. Owner is very helpful. Power back up is not there, but the owner helped us by bringing a candle when the power went off. But for the money we paid, this guest was very nice."

This charming guest house, tucked away in an unconventional location, offers a delightful combination of comfortable rooms, excellent staff behavior, and a unique, tranquil setting.\n\n#### Location\nShayar Sikkimese Guest House is situated a bit off the beaten path, requiring a brief walk from the main road. While the location may seem a bit unusual, it contributes to the guest house’s peaceful ambiance, away from the hustle and bustle of the city center. The guest house is perched on a hillside, offering stunning views of the surrounding valleys and mountains. This slightly remote location is ideal for those seeking a serene retreat amidst nature.\n\n#### Rooms\nThe rooms at Shayar Sikkimese Guest House are well-appointed and cozy, providing a perfect blend of comfort and local charm. Each room is tastefully decorated with traditional Sikkimese elements, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The beds are comfortable, and the bathrooms are clean and equipped with modern amenities. Despite being a guest house, the quality of the rooms rivals that of many higher-end accommodations.\n\n#### Staff Behavior\nOne of the most commendable aspects of Shayar Sikkimese Guest House is the behavior of the staff. From the moment I arrived, the staff members were exceptionally welcoming and attentive. They were always ready to assist with any requests, whether it was arranging transportation, offering local recommendations, or ensuring that my stay was comfortable. Their genuine hospitality and friendly demeanor made my experience truly enjoyable.\n\n#### Amenities\nWhile Shayar Sikkimese Guest House does not offer a wide range of luxury amenities, it provides everything necessary for a comfortable stay. The guest house has a small dining area where guests can enjoy home-cooked Sikkimese meals, which were delicious and reasonably priced. The complimentary breakfast, featuring local dishes, was a highlight of my mornings. Additionally, the guest house offers free Wi-Fi, which was reliable during my stay.\n\n#### Overall Experience\nShayar Sikkimese Guest House is a hidden gem in Gangtok, offering excellent value for money. Its slightly offbeat location adds to the charm, providing a peaceful and scenic environment. The combination of well-maintained rooms, exceptional staff behavior, and a tranquil setting makes it an ideal choice for travelers seeking a cozy and affordable stay in Gangtok.\n\nIn conclusion, Shayar Sikkimese Guest House stands out for its warm hospitality, comfortable accommodations, and unique location. If you’re looking for a quiet and charming place to stay in Gangtok, away from the usual tourist spots, Shayar Sikkimese Guest House is definitely worth considering."

There was only one person who was managing the whole hotel including, housekeeping and kitchen and cause of that the breakfast was not good at all. Got served burnt toast. No dinner too so we had to go sll the way to mg marg just to have dinner. I think the hotel needs more staff to run the hotel other than that its a very nice property and the stay was very peaceful."

From the moment we entered our assigned room, we were met with an unbearable and pervasive foul odor, seemingly originating from a \"mat potty\" present in the room. This stench permeated the entire floor and made our stay immediately unpleasant.\nBeyond the overwhelming smell, the general condition of the room was appalling. Everything felt old, worn, and neglected. The bedsheets and pillows were visibly dirty, raising serious hygiene concerns and making us question the overall cleanliness of the establishment. Adding to the misery, there was active leakage on the room wall, a clear indication of significant disrepair and lack of maintenance.\nThe issues didn't end with the room. The food served was unhygienic and of very low quality, further compounding our negative experience.\nBased on the unacceptable state of our room, the pervasive odors, the lack of cleanliness, and the poor quality of the food, we can unequivocally say that this hotel does not meet the standards of a 3-star establishment. Our stay was truly unpleasant, and we would strongly advise others to avoid this hotel to prevent a similarly disappointing experience."

This was the most disgusting and disturbing hotel experience I’ve ever had.\n\nThe room was in a horrifying condition – filthy bedsheets, foul smell, spider webs all over the walls and ceiling, and to top it off, actual human potty on the bathroom door mat. That’s not just dirty, that’s inhumane. It’s clear they do not clean or even inspect the rooms before handing them over.\n\nThe bathroom was moldy and stinking, clearly untouched for days. The food was just as bad – unhygienic, tasteless, and made me feel sick. Nothing about this hotel is safe or comfortable. The staff was rude and completely unbothered when we complained.\n\nThis is not a hotel – it’s a health hazard. Staying here was a huge mistake. If you value your health and peace of mind, stay far away from this place. I genuinely believe this hotel should be shut down by authorities."

The food here is decent and hygienic. The breakfast spread was delicious. However, some curries ordered alacarte for dinner were a bit oily. Could improve on that. Lastly, tarrif wise, this place is light on the pocket. Overall, it is a value for money hotel with great service that I would recommend to people looking for hotels in Gangtok."

We had previously stayed at another hotel but did not like it, so we looked into this one.  Rooms are reasonably priced and exceptionally clean.  One thing about the owner: he's incredibly nice and humble.  All of the hotel staff were excellent.  Our five-day visit in Sikkim was unforgettable. I will recommend everyone to go there."

From the moment we arrived, we felt less like hotel guests and more like welcomed visitors in a family home.\n\nCloseness Towards Guests: The hosts at The Shire, particularly Karma and his family, are consistently praised for their friendly and helpful nature. They go above and beyond to ensure guests feel comfortable and at home. The personal touch and willingness to engage with guests truly stood out. For instance, though the meals were not included in the stay, Karma and his mother communicated to ask whether we required meals from time to time, and also though there was less parking place available, Karma gladly accomodated our Isuzu MUX.  The height in embracing the guests with personal touch was that Karma and his family kept the same room we check in on first day available for us while we returned, kept our excessive luggage and car fridge with them until we returned and also gladly accepted our request to reshuffle return arrival days which happened because of bad climatic conditions in North Sikkim.\n\nServices: The services provided were commendable. The rooms are generally described as clean and cozy, with daily housekeeping ensuring a comfortable stay and are well-maintained and equipped with necessary amenities like electric kettles etc. The availability of free Wi-Fi was also a plus. We enjoyed the delicious and wholesome food served even Sikkimese Cuisine at times, often featuring local flavors.  We particularly enjoyed the breakfast, which offered a good mix of options.\n\nSurroundings: We experienced The Shire as a green and peaceful oasis where one can enjoy gardens with blooming flowers and the sight of butterflies with home created garden.\n\nIn summary, The Shire offers a peaceful retreat with a strong emphasis on making guests feel welcome and importantly cared for.

It has a beautiful garden with good views and brightens up the mornings.\nThey also provide some authentic wholesome home cooked meals and the service is excellent.\nIt is at around 15 mins walking distance from mg road but the walk is quite steep. However there are shared taxis available if needed and you could enquire about the same."

The hosts were incredibly warm, welcoming, and attentive to every detail, making me feel right at home from the moment I arrived. The room was clean, cozy, and thoughtfully decorated, with all the amenities I needed for a comfortable stay.\n\nThe highlight was definitely the beautifully maintained garden filled with vibrant flowers — it created such a peaceful and refreshing atmosphere. The surroundings were calm and scenic, perfect for relaxing and enjoying nature.\n\nAunty’s home-cooked food was absolutely delicious — made with love and care, just like how a family would cook for you. Every meal felt comforting and reminded me of home. The hosts treated me like one of their own, always making sure I was comfortable and well taken care of.\n\nIf you’re looking for a quiet, cozy place with beautiful surroundings and a warm, welcoming atmosphere, this is the perfect homestay. I’ll definitely come back again!"

They have a lovely garden open to sky with a view of Gangtok city. The host and his mother did everything to make our stay memorable and the conversations around their culture, traditions and lifestyle were interesting. A must visit homestay if you want to experience hospitality at its best."

The look and feel of this homestay is as good as any 5 star hotel, mostly because of the opulent furniture, cutlery, paintings and the plants. We paid a reasonable amount for all this and the owner was kind enough to accommodate us in the deluxe room despite the standard room booking. (PS - it may not happen during peak season) we had a beautiful view from our room and the icing on the cake was the K2 view right from their lawn!! They serve very good English breakfast at affordable prices. The only thing  we felt was the dinner could have been of little less cost. One thing to be noted, they serve simple and tasty organic meals and be very mindful to eat light as it will keep you going in your hectic drives to north sikkim. Last point, the location is little down in Arithang area of Gangtok, so that may bother you unless you are a fitness freak like me :) I absolutely loved my stay here, the family is doing an amazing job at maintaining this place 😊 save sometime for this peaceful homestay tucked in a cozy corner of Gangtok. They have a nice.lobby with a mini library. You can't get enough of this place!! Thank you for my wonderful time here 😊😊😊"
