Apart from the breath taking waterfall that blows cool wind on your entire body, you can zip line/ traverse two rope bridge right in front of it. There is also a proper rock climbing facility that is so much better than others in a similar class. Many picturesque spots, the more you explore the more you are mesmerized by the beauty of this place. You can also do a boat ride and the food is also really amazing. Definitely recommend visiting this place, if possible then at sundown.",

Tucked away in a beautifully forested area, this place felt like a slice of peace and power combined. As soon as I entered, I could hear the distant roar of the waterfall-it instantly made me excited.\nThe entry fee is ₹50 per person, which I found very affordable for what the place offers. There's also parking available right near the entrance-convenient and spacious. The exact parking fee might depend on the vehicle, but it was reasonably priced i e ₹20-50\nBefore even entering the main waterfall area, there are several small shops and food stalls. I found some really good local snacks and souvenirs here, which added to the experience. It's perfect if you're looking to grab a bite or shop a little before heading in. Inside, the area is very well maintained. There are man-made walkways, charming bridges, and statues representing Sikkimese shamanic traditions-which made the place both cultural and educational. The waterfall itself was absolutely breathtaking. Standing near it, feeling the mist on my face, was so refreshing. It's also a great photo spot, with greenery all around and the powerful water cascading down. Overall, I had a fantastic time at Ban Jhakri Waterfall. It's a perfect mix of nature, culture, and relaxation-ideal for families, couples, or solo travelers. I'd definitely recommend including it in your Gangtok itinerary.",

My experience was nothing short of extraordinary, and I felt deeply connected to the divine.\n\nAs I climbed the stairs leading to the temple, I felt a sense of serenity wash over me. The temple's serene ambiance, coupled with the stunning natural beauty of the surrounding hills, created a sense of tranquility that was hard to ignore.\n\nThe temple itself is a beautiful structure that exudes a sense of peace and calm. The idol of Lord Hanuman, the revered deity, is imposing yet benevolent, and I felt a deep sense of connection to the divine as I offered my prayers.\n\nWhat struck me most about Hanuman Tok was the sense of community that pervaded the temple premises. Devotees from all walks of life had gathered to offer their prayers, and the sense of camaraderie was palpable.\n\nAs I stood there, taking in the breathtaking views of the Himalayas, I felt grateful for the experience. Hanuman Tok is more than just a temple - it's a spiritual haven that offers a sense of peace, calm, and connection to the divine.\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Gangtok, I highly recommend a visit to Hanuman Tok.

Nestled at an altitude of about 7,200 feet, Hanuman Tok is not just a temple-it's a peaceful haven that offers breathtaking views of the surrounding Himalayan ranges and a serene atmosphere for inner reflection.\nI visited with my friends, and together we spent around two hours there, soaking in the divine energy and scenic beauty. The drive up to the temple was beautiful, with winding roads surrounded by lush greenery and crisp mountain air. Upon reaching, we were greeted by the majestic statue of Lord Hanuman, standing tall and powerful, instilling a deep sense of peace and devotion.\nThe temple complex is immaculately maintained by the Indian Army, which adds to its charm and sanctity. The panoramic view of Gangtok city from the temple grounds is absolutely stunning, and the quiet environment made it perfect for prayer and meditation. We spent our time exploring the temple, offering prayers, and simply sitting in silence to feel the divine connection.\nBeing there was an emotional and uplifting experience for me. As a big devotee of Lord Hanuman, I felt truly blessed and spiritually recharged. It was a memorable journey shared with close friends, and Hanuman Tok now holds a special place in my heart. I would highly recommend it to anyone seeking peace, devotion, and natural beauty.",

The atmosphere is peaceful, the air crisp and clean, and the views-absolutely mesmerizing. From here, you get a panoramic view of the lush green hills and valleys that define the landscape of Gangtok. But what truly sets Ganesh Tok apart is the majestic view of Mount Kanchenjunga, the third-highest peak in the world. When the sky is clear and the early morning sun begins to rise, the snow-capped peaks of Kanchenjunga glow in golden hues, creating a picture-perfect moment that stays etched in your memory forever.\n\nThe best time to visit Ganesh Tok is between March and June, especially during the early morning hours of 7 AM to 9 AM. During this time, the skies are generally clear, and the light is perfect for photography. The serenity of the place, combined with the soft chants from the temple and the cool mountain breeze, creates a truly spiritual and calming experience.\n\nApart from the views, the area around the temple is well-maintained and offers a peaceful vibe.",

The NIT is meticulously maintained and the staff are very friendly. Admission is 25 Rs and well worth it. The exhibits are very well preserved and displayed with an explanation in English placed next to each artefact. A wonderful showcase of Buddhism faith and culture. Well worth the visit\n\nis an important reference centre in the world of Buddhist scholarship. It houses a museum, a Tibetan library and a general reference and research centre on Tibet, Sikkim and the Himalayas.\nThe Institute is located in Deorali, to the south of central Gangtok. The opening hours are from 10 am to 4:30 pm from Monday to Saturday. It is closed on Sundays and on official government holidays.\nEntrance fee to the museum and the libraries is Rs. 25/-.\nThe Institute is located in beautiful sylvan surroundings and extensive grounds. Close by the main premises of the NIT lies a memorial park in honour of the last king of Sikkim. Amidst the beautiful surroundings stands the bronze statue of Chogyal Palden Thondup Namgyal of Sikkim.",

The institute houses a fascinating museum with rare artifacts, ancient manuscripts, thangka paintings, and Buddhist relics that provide deep insights into Tibetan heritage. The library is a treasure trove of books on religion, philosophy, and Tibetan studies.\n\nThe serene surroundings and traditional Tibetan-style architecture add to its charm, making it a peaceful place for learning and reflection. The institute plays a crucial role in preserving and promoting Tibetan culture.\n\nWhile the museum is small, it is well-curated, and a visit here can be completed in about an hour. However, photography is not allowed inside. Overall, it's a great place for history buffs, culture enthusiasts, and anyone looking to understand Tibetan Buddhism better.\n\nPros: Rich collection of artifacts, peaceful ambiance, well-maintained.\nCons: No photography inside, limited exhibit space.",

A good amount of walking was required but it only enhanced the vibe. There is one thing though, the initial walk till the parking is actually too much so I would suggest that you take your vehicle till the parking and walk the rest. The ride from the main entry to the parking is extremely aesthetic and fun. I wouldn't say that it's a must visit, however I would recommend it to anyone looking for a short trek which gives a very natural essence. Lastly, I actually experienced some hail fall along side the rain. Even though it hindered my visit to the Zoo, it was fun indeed.",
