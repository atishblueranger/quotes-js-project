        "detail_description": "If you tire of Shanghai's incessant quest for modernity, this tiny town is only a hop, skip and metro ride away. An ancient settlement that prospered during the Ming and Qing dynasties, it is littered with traditional historic architecture, threaded by small, busy alleyways and cut by a picturesque canal. If you can somehow blot out the crowds, Qibao brings you the flavours of old China. When you exit the station, head down Minzhu Rd and follow the signs to the Old Street.\nThere are nine official sights included in the through ticket, though you can also skip the ticket and just pay ¥7 to ¥15 per sight as you go. The best of the bunch include the Cotton Textile Mill, the Shadow Puppet Museum (performances from 1pm to 3pm Wednesday and Sunday) and Zhou's Miniature Carving House. Half-hour boat rides along the canal slowly ferry passengers from Number One Bridge to Dongtangtan (东塘滩, Dōngtángtān) and back. Also worth ferreting out is the Catholic Church, adjacent to a convent off Qibao Nanjie, south of the canal.Wander along Bei Dajie north of the canal for souvenirs. South of the canal, Nan Dajie is full of snacks and small eateries, such as No 14, which sells sweet tāngyuán dumplings, and No 19, which is a rarely seen traditional teahouse."

        "detail_description": "China’s tallest building dramatically twists skywards from its footing in Lujiazui. The 121-storey, 632m-tall, Gensler-designed Shanghai Tower topped out in August 2013 and opened in mid-2016. The spiral-shaped tower houses office space, entertainment venues, shops, a conference centre, a luxury hotel and ‘sky lobbies’. The gently corkscrewing form – its nine interior cylindrical units wrapped in two glass skins – is the world’s second-tallest building at the time of writing. The observation deck on the 118th floor is the world's highest.\nThe twist is introduced by the outer skin of glass that swivels through 120 degrees as it rises, while atrium ‘sky gardens’ in the vertical spaces sandwiched between the two layers of glass open up a large volume of the tower to public use. The tower is sustainably designed: as well as providing insulation, the huge area of glass vastly reduces electrical consumption through the use of sunlight. The tower’s shape furthermore reduces wind loads by 24%, which generated a saving of US$58m in construction costs. Before the tower even went up, engineers were faced with building a 61,000-cu-metre concrete mat that would support its colossal mass in the boggy land of Pudong.Uppermost floors of the tower are reserved for that obligatory Shanghai attraction – the world’s highest skydeck above ground level – with passengers ferried skywards in the world’s fastest lifts (64km/h), designed by Mitsubishi (and the world’s tallest single-lift elevator). Visitors can gaze down on both the Jinmao Tower and Shanghai World Financial Center below. A six-level luxury retail podium fills the base of the tower."

        "detail_description": "One of Shanghai’s few active Buddhist monasteries, this temple was built between 1918 and 1928. The highlight is a transcendent Buddha crafted from pure jade, one of five shipped back to China by the monk Hui Gen at the turn of the 20th century. It's a popular stopover for tour buses, so be prepared for crowds. During the Lunar New Year (usually February), the temple is very busy, as some 20,000 Chinese Buddhists throng to pray for prosperity.\nThe first temple on your immediate left upon entering is the Hall of Heavenly Kings, holding the statues of the Four Heavenly Kings who look upon the four cardinal points. Directly opposite is the twin-eaved Grand Hall, the temple's most significant building, where worshippers pray to the past, present and future Buddhas. Also within the Grand Hall are splendidly carved luóhàn (arhats), lashed to the walls with wires, and a copper-coloured statue of Guanyin at the rear. Passing through the Grand Hall you'll reach a gated tranquil courtyard, where stairs lead up to the Jade Buddha Hall. The absolute centrepiece of the temple is the 1.9m-high pale-green jade Buddha, seated upstairs and carved from one piece. Photographs are not permitted. Further into the complex is the Reclining Budda Hall, which contains a small reclining white jade Buddha from Burma that's displayed in a glass cabinet. The Mahavira Hall was renovated and reopened in 2019; it was raised by a metre and now stands at 18.2m tall and weighs in at 1000 tonnes.To get here, take either Changshou metro station exit 5 and walk along Anyuan Rd, or get off at Jiangning Rd metro and walk south along Jiangning Rd. There's a vegetarian restaurant within the temple complex."

        "detail_description": "With the original temple dating back to AD 1216, the much-restored Jing'an Temple was here well before all the audacious skyscrapers and glitzy shopping malls. Today it stands like a shimmering mirage in defiance of West Nanjing Rd’s soaring modern architecture: a sacred portal to the Buddhist world that partially, at least, underpins this metropolis of 24 million souls.\nWhile the tinkle of wind chimes and burning of incense can't compete with the blaring horns outside, the temple still emits an air of reverence.Constructed largely of Burmese teak, the temple has some impressive statues, including a massive 8.8m-high, 15-tonne silver Buddha in the main Mahavira Hall with 46 pillars; a 3.87m-high Burmese white-jade Sakyamuni in the side halls; and a five-tonne Guanyin statue in the Guanyin Hall, carved from a 1000-year-old camphor tree. It still rattles away to the sounds of construction, while in the bunker beneath the main hall is an unfinished space, housing 18 glittering luóhàn (arhats), but little else. The complex has been designed to incorporate shops and restaurants around its perimeter – including a fantastic vegetarian restaurant at the rear – which stretches around the block, and the metro runs right underneath. The ¥50 admission charge is steep, however, for such a modest and thoroughly modern place of worship.Khi Vehdu, who ran Jing'an Temple in the 1930s, was one of the most remarkable figures of the time. The nearly 2m-tall abbot had a large following as well as seven concubines, each of whom had a house and a car. During the Cultural Revolution, the temple was stripped of its Buddhist statues and transformed into a plastics factory before burning to the ground in 1972.Good times to visit include the Festival of Bathing Buddha (on the eighth day of the fourth lunar month) and at the full moon."

The forward-thinking, provocative and downright entertaining island6 focuses on collaborative works created in a studio behind the gallery. Budding photographers should absolutely pop into DN Club, with its classes using vintage SLRs and a dark room for developing prints.Most galleries are open from 10am to 6pm, with the majority closed Mondays."

There are three observation decks – on levels 94, 97 and 100 – with altitude-adjusted ticket prices and wow-factor lifts thrown in.A clear, smog-free day is imperative, so check the weather and pollution index beforehand.\nThe top two decks (at the bottom and top of the trapezoid) are known as Sky Walks. It’s debatable whether the top Sky Walk (474m) is the best spot for Shang-high views, though. The hexagonal space is bright and futuristic, and some of the floor is transparent glass, but the lack of a 360-degree sweep – windows only face west or east – detracts somewhat. But you get to look down on the top of the Jinmao Tower, which might be worth the ticket price alone.Access to the observation deck is on the west side of the building off Dongtai Rd; access to the Park Hyatt is on the south side of the building. If you want to make a meal (or a cocktail) of it, or if lines are long, you can sashay into the Park Hyatt's restaurant/bar 100 Century Avenue on the 91st floor instead."

Exhibitions span diverse ecologies, humankind and geology, the treasures of earth and the way of evolution.Dinosaur fossils are well represented (including the indigenous Yunnanese 'Lufeng lizard'); these are interspersed with impressive life-like mechanical dinosaurs that move and roar.The building's exterior spirals like a nautilus shell topped by a curved lawn embankment, Chinese-inspired water garden and vertical garden wall. Within, the main architectural feature is a 30m-high glass atrium, with a conical molecular-shaped glass 'cell wall' that floods the building with natural light. Symbolic of the living organisms within, its transparent core holds a tranquil courtyard garden with a pond full of plants, trickling waterfalls and rocky outcrops."

The much-renovated temple is said to date from the 10th century.\nThe main halls to visit on the complex are Mile Dian (Maitreya Hall), Tianwang Dian (Hall of Heavenly Kings), Daxiongbao Dian (Grand Hall of the Great Sage), Sansheng Dian (Three Sages Hall) and the Laughing Buddha Hall; note the four huge Heavenly Kings, each in charge of a compass point. The temple is particularly famed for its 6500kg bell, cast in 1894.A large effigy of Shakyamuni seated on a lotus flower resides within the main hall (Daxiongbao Dian), while the Sansheng Dian holds a golden trinity of Buddhist statues. Also on the complex is the Thousand Luohan Hall, sheltering a huge legion of glittering arhat.Opposite the temple entrance rises the seven-storey, 44m-high Longhua Pagoda, originally built in AD 977. Visitors are not allowed to climb it, but may recognise it from Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun.The best time to visit is during the Longhua Temple Fair, in the third month of the lunar calendar (usually during April or May); entry may be more expensive during festivities."

If visiting during spring there's plenty to explore, from peony, conifer, magnolia, fern and rose gardens to a Chinese cymbidium garden. The colours and volume of flowers are staggering and the routes are very pleasant to walk. The northern side of the gardens has a dusty memorial temple, originally built in 1728. It’s dedicated to Huang Daopo, said to have kick-started Shanghai’s cotton industry by bringing the knowledge of spinning and weaving to the region from Hainan. It's a 20-minute walk from Shilong Rd metro stop."

You'll need a day to properly experience the sights, which include both original and re-created paifang archways, courtyards, bridges, pagodas, plus several museums. Highlights include the Underground Pottery Museum, filled with 500 pieces excavated from the local area (spanning from 5000 BC to 907 BC) and the Guangfulin Culture Museum.\nThe latter is set in an impressive modern building that appears to rise out of the lake; it tells the story of the Neolithic period up to the present day, but prepare to queue to get in. Visitors can bang massive drums on their way around the Mooning Gallery of National Musical Instruments exhibition. For a break from the museums, head to the Duoyun Bookstore. Set in an Anhui-style building, it contains calligraphy displays and gifts, as well as a cafe. Dining options in the park are all good.Bring sunscreen and a hat, as there's not much shade in the summer months. It's a 10-minute bus ride (¥1, Nos 15 or 24) or five-minute taxi ride (around ¥20) from Songjiang University Town. At the time of research, a new science museum was due to open inside the park, as were three hotels."

        "detail_description": "It’s hard not to be impressed by the beautiful shíkùmén architecture of Zhang Garden, down Taixing Rd, off West Nanjing Rd and west of Shimen No 1 Rd. What you see here today – mainly shíkùmén housing, a mix of two- and three-bay villas with tall entryways, handsome windows and hanging balcony pavilions – is merely a small portion of the former site. What survives is a sign of the wealth of its pre-1949 occupants.\nFormerly known as Arcadia Hall, the site was first built in 1878 by a European merchant as a fairground for foreigners. It was acquired in 1882 by Zhang Shuhe, a wealthy Wuxi businessman, who later opened it up to the public. There was a huge garden, a dance hall, meeting rooms, a theatre for Chinese opera, a photography studio, a teahouse and restaurants. It later served as a location for political meetings and rallies against the Qing government.Today a single shíkùmén villa can house 20 or even 40 families, a mix of Shanghainese residents and migrant families from neighbouring provinces. It's easy to get lost in the alleys, but don't worry – you'll find your way back to the main boulevard eventually. In the evening, security guards for the nearby Tap House prevent visitors from wandering around the lanes; architecture fans should come in the morning before their shift starts."

The Catholics taught orphans the techniques of Western art: one of the first things you see as you enter the museum is a small, exquisite and exact copy of the Tianning Pagoda in Beijing and a magnificent wooden páilou (decorative arch), the Tushanwan Archway, carved in 1913.\nThere’s a wealth of objects either produced or relating to the orphanage, from religious ornaments to Jesuit literature. Woodcraft in particular was produced at the orphanage, so some splendid items can be admired; look out for the expertly carved Li Kui and His Double, fashioned from boxwood, and the Madonna from the 1920s. Filling out the rest of the fascinating collection are paintings and stained glass. Audio tours are available (a deposit of ¥100 or ID is required)."
