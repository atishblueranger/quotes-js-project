    "detail_description": "Turbulent waters carve a path through this craggy glacier gorge. A footpath weaves through tunnels hacked into cliffs veined with pink and green marble. It’s justifiably a popular spot for canyon and bungee-jumping expeditions. The gorge is a half-hour walk south from Grindelwald or take bus 2 from the train station.\n"
