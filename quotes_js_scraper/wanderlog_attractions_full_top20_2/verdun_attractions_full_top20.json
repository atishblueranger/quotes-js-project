Despite being partially destroyed during the battle of Verdun in 1916, some parts of the cathedral still bear scars from the devastation. Visitors can admire its beautiful facade and witness the remnants of war on its exterior walls. The interior offers a serene atmosphere for prayer and reflection.",
