The waterfall's striking golden color comes from the minerals deposited in the riverbed, creating a beautiful contrast with the lush green surroundings. This cascade appears to glow with a yellow hue due to its high mineral content, including sulfur, arsenic, and copper ore flowing down from the mountain above.",
