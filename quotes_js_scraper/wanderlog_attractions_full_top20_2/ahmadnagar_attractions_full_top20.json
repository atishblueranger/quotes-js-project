The temple houses a black stone representing the Hindu God symbolizing the planet Saturn and is believed to be Swayambhu, emerging in this form to bless devotees. The village where the temple stands is unique as none of its houses have doors and locks, as people trust Lord Shani to protect their belongings from theft.",
