While some visitors preferred other nearby beaches like Playa del Moro, this beach still received positive feedback for its pleasant atmosphere. It's considered a chillout secret in Bahia Ream and although it may not be anything extraordinary, it's still quite nice and worth considering for a relaxing day by the sea.",
