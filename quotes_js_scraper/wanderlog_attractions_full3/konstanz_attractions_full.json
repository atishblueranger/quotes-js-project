The circular route on the island offered a delightful experience with its enchanting theme of fairy tales. Thanks to Lake Constance, the weather was exceptionally enjoyable, making the entire journey even more pleasant. The highlight of the event was undoubtedly the stunning light show, which I highly recommend attending.",
