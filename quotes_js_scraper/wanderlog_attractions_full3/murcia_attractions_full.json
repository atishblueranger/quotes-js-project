They had an incredible time and successfully completed the challenge of the camping-themed room. Alessandra, one of the staff members, was fantastic with the children and made their experience even more enjoyable. We highly recommend Escape Play as it exceeded our expectations. We will definitely be returning for future events or visits to this exceptional venue.",
