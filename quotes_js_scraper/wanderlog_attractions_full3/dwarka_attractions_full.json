This pristine location offers a peaceful atmosphere for relaxation, making it an ideal break from sightseeing. The 500-meter-long ghat stretches along the Gomti bank, providing refreshing bathing experiences during high tide. Despite its beauty, the area lacks separate facilities for men and women and can be marred by stray cows.",
