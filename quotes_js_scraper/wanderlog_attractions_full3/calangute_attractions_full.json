        "detail_description": "The Church of St Alex in Calangute is an architectural marvel with its two towers, magnificent dome, and ornate altars. It stands out from other churches due to its appealing design and striking features. In 1996, the village celebrated the fourth centenary of this parish church. Although I couldn't enter the church during my visit, I was able to admire its beauty from outside. The stunning architecture and serene surroundings make it a must-see attraction in Calangute.",
