The standout dish was the egg kutto rotti, which resembled the flavorful fried carrot cake from Singapore but with added ingredients. The cheese rotti also impressed as they were generous with their usage of a cheese reminiscent of laughing cow cheese. However, the chicken fried rice left something to be desired as the portion of chicken was almost insignificant.",
