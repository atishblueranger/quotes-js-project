        "detail_description": "The Three Sisters Lamp is a historic landmark located near Prince William St. in Saint John Harbour. These three red gas lamps were used by sea captains to navigate safely into the harbor at night, visible up to three miles out to sea. Restored in 1967 and replaced in 1997, these lamps have been guiding mariners since 1848. Visitors can enjoy the view of the Bay of Fundy and watch ships coming and going from this picturesque spot with a rich maritime history.",
