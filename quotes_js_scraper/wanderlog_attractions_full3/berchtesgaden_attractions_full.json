Fortunately, the lack of crowds makes the wait bearable. However, there is a mid-way cart switch that can be confusing as there is no staff present to inform passengers. Nevertheless, the ride offers breathtaking views and a refreshing atmosphere. The short 5-10 minute journey from the base station to the middle stop proves worthwhile.",
