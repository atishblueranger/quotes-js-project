There are also educational programs available for visitors to learn about the different species. The zoo has a large area for walking and an internal bus service at a reasonable price. Food options are available along the sidewalk and there is even a small playground for children. However, the zoo requires further development and attention from local government to strengthen its facilities with better renovations and more animal variants.",
