Initially considered a sanctuary, it holds appreciable heritage such as the baptismal font. The history of the Sanctuary dates back to 1421 when the image of Lady of Africa was sent to Ceuta by Don Enrique the Navigator. The primitive temple is believed to be identified with the head of the current Sanctuary, featuring baroque architecture.",
