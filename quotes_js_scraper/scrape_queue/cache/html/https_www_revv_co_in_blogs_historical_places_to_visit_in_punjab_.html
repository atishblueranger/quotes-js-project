Apart from all these, something that will attract not only the history buffs, but other tourists as well is the number of historical Places to visit in Punjab. There are several forts, monuments, palaces, and museums in Punjab that were built thousands years ago and which will take you to the days of the past. So, let us check the places that we can visit once we are in Punjab.

1. Golden Temple

Golden Temple or Sri Harmandir Sahib is the holiest place for the Sikh community. The Golden Temple witnesses millions of tourists and devotees all round the year. The temple was constructed in the 16th century and ever since then it is surrounded by a beautiful lake. The holy texts of the community were introduced in this temple itself. The upper floor of the temple was actually made of pure gold. 


Timings: Open 24 hours


Entry Fee: Free


Travel Tip: Visit early morning or at night to see the temple beautifully lit.


Car Rental Tip: Rent a self-drive car in Amritsar to explore other local attractions like the Partition Museum, Durgiana Temple, and Gobindgarh Fort at your own pace.


2. Jallianwala Bagh

A popular patriotic historical place in Punjab, Jallianwala Bagh is located at a very close proximity to the Golden Temple. When you visit Jallianwala Bagh, you can still find the well in which thousands of people jumped in to save themselves from the firing that was opened by the Army of General Dyer in 1919. You can also see the blood stains and marks of bullets on the walls in the garden.


Timings: 6:30 AM – 7:30 PM


Entry Fee: Free


Travel Tip: Don’t miss the evening light and sound show.


Car Rental Tip: A car rental allows easy travel from here to Wagah Border and other nearby museums.


3. Maharaja Ranjit Singh Museum

 
Located in the middle of Ram Bagh Garden in Amritsar, Maharaja Ranjit Singh Museum was the summer palace of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, the first king of the Sikh empire. You will find much information about the life of first Sikh king, and also art, architecture, and history of the Sikh community between 18th and 19th century. The palace was converted into a museum in 1977. This is one of the nearby famous places from Golden Temple and is just 4 km away.


Timings: 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM (Closed on Mondays)


Entry Fee: ₹10 – ₹40


Travel Tip: Combine this with a picnic in the nearby Ram Bagh Garden.


Car Rental Tip: Ideal to include in a cultural day tour around Amritsar with your rental car.


4. Wagah Border

Wagah Border is one of the attractions that no tourist should miss while on their trip to Punjab. Located at a distance of 28 km from Amritsar, this is the place where boundaries between India and Pakistan are marked. The flag ceremony in Wagah Border has been conducting since 1959 by both the Indian Border Security Force and Pakistan Rangers. The ceremony includes closing the international gates every single day and lowering the flags of the respective countries. Every day before the sunset, soldiers from the Army of both the countries meet at this gate and display military camaraderie for 30 minutes. Tourists from across the country visit Wagah Border all through the year. 


Timings: Ceremony starts around 4:15 PM (Winter) / 5:15 PM (Summer)


Entry Fee: Free


Travel Tip: Arrive at least 1–1.5 hours early for good seats.


Car Rental Tip: Since the border is about 30 km from Amritsar, a self-drive rental ensures a stress-free trip.


5. Maharaja Ranjit Singh War Museum

Located in Ludhiana, Maharaja Ranjit Singh War Museum has over twelve galleries with memoirs from ancient history to Kargil War.


Timings: 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM (Closed on Mondays)


Entry Fee: ₹30–₹50


Travel Tip: Interactive exhibits and light & sound shows available.

6. Khair-ud-Din Masjid

Most famous historical place in Punjab, Khair-ud-Din Masjid was established by Mohammed Khairuddin in 1876 CE. The mosque is popular for its spectacular architecture. This is precisely the place where Tootie-e-Hind, Shah Attaullah Bukhari had announced the call for waging war to loot the British rulers.


Timings: 5:00 AM – 8:00 PM


Entry Fee: Free


Travel Tip: Dress modestly; photography may be restricted inside.


Car Rental Tip: Located in the heart of Amritsar, easily reachable by rental car if you’re exploring heritage trails.


7. Gurudwara Mata Kaulan

As you enter Golden Temple, you will see Gurudwara Mata Kaulan on the west side of the temple. The gurudwara was named after a Muslim woman, Bibi Kaulan, who was a devotee of Guru Har Gobind. Her kirtans were admired by many and till date remembered by the older members of the Sikh community. The sarovar that you will see next to Gurudwara Mata Kaulan is called Kaulsar Sahib or Sarovar and is one of the five holy tanks in the city.


Timings: 5:00 AM – 10:00 PM


Entry Fee: Free


Travel Tip: Ideal for a quiet spiritual reflection.


Car Rental Tip: Combine with nearby Gurudwaras and heritage sites for a day-long circuit.


8. Guru Ke Mahal

Guru Ke Mahal was established in 1573 by Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh guru. Back then it was a little cottage that sheltered the great gurus of the Sikhs. You can still find the Granth Sahib in Guru Ke Mahal.


Timings: 5:00 AM – 9:00 PM


Entry Fee: Free


Travel Tip: A hidden gem not many tourists know about—ideal for history buffs.


Car Rental Tip: Explore alongside other lesser-known gurudwaras in Amritsar with a car rental.


9. Lodhi Fort

Lodhi Fort, also called as Purana Qila or Old Fort was a grand structure of which you can now only find ruins. This fort was once the pride of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, and also served as the gateway of Sikander Lodhi’s empire.


Timings: 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM


Entry Fee: Free


Travel Tip: Carry water and sun protection — the site is open and large.


Car Rental Tip: Best accessed via car rental, as it’s a bit off mainstream tourist routes.



10. Sheesh Mahal

Sheesh Mahal or Palace of Mirrors was constructed in the 19th century. It is a part of the Old Moti Bagh Palace. You can still witness various frescos, which were made during the period of Maharaja Narinder Singh.


Timings: 10:00 AM – 5:00 PM (Closed Mondays)


Entry Fee: ₹10–₹50
