The garden is decent for a casual visit if you're already exploring nearby places like Chashme Shahi or Pari Mahal. It has a peaceful atmosphere and some variety of trees and plants, though it doesn't feel very well-maintained in parts. The layout is simple, and there are open green spaces which are good for a relaxed walk or a short break.

There isn’t much in terms of rare botanical attractions, and if you’ve seen other well-known gardens in Srinagar, like Shalimar or Nishat, this one may feel a bit underwhelming. Still, it's a calm place to unwind for a while, especially if you're looking for some quiet time away from the crowds.Jitendra P — Google reviewThis garden has a mountain view and many seasonal flowers.

Dal Lake is a major tourist attraction in Srinagar, drawing visitors from around the world.

Dal Lake in Srinagar is also famous for its picturesque beauty, unique houseboats and shikaras, and vibrant floating gardens. It's often called the "Jewel in the crown of Kashmir" due to its stunning scenery and the unique lifestyle it supports.

Nishat Bagh is one of Srinagar’s most renowned and historic gardens, and it was high on our list of places to visit. Situated along the scenic Boulevard Road near Nishat Ghat, this beautifully maintained Mughal garden offers an expansive and serene setting for visitors.

The garden is terraced across three levels, with each level offering a unique perspective of the surrounding landscape. A moderate walk to the top rewards visitors with stunning panoramic views of the iconic Dal Lake—a truly picturesque sight.

One of the standout features of the garden is the stream that flows gracefully through its center. This natural watercourse is said to be fed by the melting snow of the Himalayas, adding both charm and a refreshing ambiance to the setting.

Visitor Tips:

Allocate at least 1 to 2 hours to fully explore and appreciate the garden.

Carry a water bottle and an umbrella, as sudden rain showers are common in the region.

Reaching the upper levels of the garden may be challenging for young children or elderly visitors due to the incline.

If you plan to sit and relax, consider bringing a waterproof mat, as the grass often remains damp from recent rainfall.

Nishat Bagh is a perfect blend of natural beauty, historical significance, and architectural elegance—a must-visit for anyone exploring Srinagar.Mustaque M — Google reviewVisited Nishat Garden in Kashmir in May 2024. It is a really beautiful garden on the east side of Dal Lake. It is the second biggest garden in Kashmir, after Shalimar Bagh. The garden has twelve terraces rising gently from the Dal Lake towards the Zabaran Mountains. A stream of water runs through the middle, with fountains and small waterfalls. This makes the garden look and feel very peaceful. From the garden, you get amazing views of Dal Lake and the snowy mountains behind it. There are tall Chinar and Cypress trees all around, and lots of colorful flowers. It is a very pretty and happy place.
Tourists love to take lots of pictures here with their family and friends. Kids of all ages enjoy it too. They play, run around, and even splash in the water channel. When we visited in May 2024, there were many tourists having a good time in the garden. You need to buy a ticket to enter the garden. There is parking available inside and also along the street. It is good to check with the garden authorities or recent visitors beforehand to understand  wheelchair accessibility. Nearby, you can find many small shops selling quick food, ice cream, fresh drinks, and snacks.

The market happens after early morning prayers, so need to reach the area around 5.30AM. After sunrise there will be no market here.Sajeev T — Google reviewIt’s a part of dal lake but pretty deep inside. It’s an off beat destination and should be reached before sunrise so you can see the whole market bustling in full energy. They have vegetables, flowers, kahwa, goodies, handcrafted items, imitation jewellery, clothes and artistic items for sale during the morning. Reach there before sunrise and ask your shikara boatman to guide you through the places I’m between. Trust me, this is one of the best experiences I’ve had in Kashmir!Sai S — Google reviewThe Floating Vegetable Market on Dal Lake in Srinagar is a unique and captivating experience, highly recommended by most visitors. Here's a breakdown of what makes it so special:
What to Expect & Experience:
* Unique Cultural Insight: It's a living testament to Kashmiri culture and the traditional way of life on Dal Lake. You'll see local farmers and vendors conducting their wholesale business from their Shikara boats.
* Vibrant and Bustling Atmosphere: Despite starting early, the market is a hub of activity. Boats laden with fresh vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers, water chestnuts, lotus stems, etc.), fruits, and even flowers create a colorful spectacle against the serene backdrop of the lake.
* Photographer's Paradise: The morning light, the colorful boats, the reflections on the still water, and the friendly interactions between vendors and buyers make for incredible photography opportunities. Many reviews highlight this as a prime reason to visit.
* Authentic Interactions: While it's becoming a tourist attraction, it's primarily a local wholesale market. You'll witness friendly haggling and a strong community spirit among the traders. Some vendors also cater to tourists, selling saffron, cookies, and handicrafts.
* Peaceful Shikara Ride: The journey to the market itself is an experience. You'll glide through the tranquil waters, passing by houseboats and local residences, offering a glimpse into the daily life of the lake dwellers.
Best Time to Visit:
* Early Morning is Crucial: The market starts very early, typically between 4:00 AM and 5:00 AM, and is largely over by 7:00 AM. To witness the full hustle and bustle, arriving before sunrise is essential.
* Peak Seasons: The months of March to October are generally considered the best time to visit Dal Lake and the floating market, as the weather is pleasant. Summer (April to November) offers warm weather and mild temperatures, making the early morning ride comfortable

* Dress Appropriately: While not explicitly mentioned for the market itself, it's generally good to carry a scarf and warm clothes, especially in the early morning, as Dal Lake can be windy.
* Limited Facilities: As it's a floating market, expect limited facilities like restrooms.
* Observe and Absorb: While you can buy items, a significant part of the experience is simply observing the unique local life and the vibrant exchange.
The Dal Lake Floating Vegetable Market is a truly memorable and worthwhile experience. It offers a unique cultural immersion, stunning photographic opportunities, and a glimpse into a traditional way of life that is fast disappearing.Syed Q — Google reviewThe amazing FLOATING VEGETABLE AND FLOWERS MARKET in Dal Lake, Srinagar Kashmir

Srinagar's Dal Lake is famous the world over for its scenic location, for its Shikaras (boats) that float on it and for the promotion of aqua sports like water skiing. The Dal Lake is also famous for its 'floating vegetable market', the only one of its kind in India and only the second in the world, the other being the rowing shops along the backwaters of the Mekong Delta in Vietnam.

Floating vegetable vendors are a prime tourist attraction in the Kashmir Valley, and this is reflected in the sales and annual turnover, estimated to be in the range of Rs. 35 crores. There are no permanent shops on the lake. The floating market first attracted international attention in 1960, when a Japanese photographer featured it in a tourist guide that was published out of Japan.

Around 10,000 kanals (around 1,250 acres) of land along the Dal Lake is being used for the cultivation of vegetables, "This is a very old market where the sale and the purchase of vegetables take place between 5 am. and to 7 am. everyday. Most of the vegetables are grown on the lakeside and retrieved from the lake before being sold in just 2 hours. Any vegetables left over are taken to street markets. This market is famous. Many tourists come here just to take photographs of it. Dal Lake is home to vast stretches of lotus plant. Lotus flowers not only balance the wetland ecosystem, but also lend a special kind of beauty to the lake.Bilal P — Google reviewAmazing place in the middle of Dal lake where you can see local vendors doing business for fresh organic vegetables.

The Sabji Bazaar (meaning vegetable market) is the prime fascination for tourists in the valleys of Kashmir. It is an unorganized market where individual sellers gather in the center of the lake at the break of day and wrap up just as the sunlight touches the water.This market doesn't encourage selective or partial selling of items; it focuses instead on selling wholesale. The items for sale include tomatoes, carrots, turnips, leafy vegetables, and the famous nadru (lotus roots, a delicacy in the Kashmir Valley), all sown in the rich ecosystem of this wetland. The popular Kashmir flowers are also produced and sold in this market.Ansars P — Google reviewA unique experience. We were surprised to see very few tourists. Vegetables, flowers, Kashmiri roti (bread) and of course the items which are for sale to tourists.

No prior intimation was put up on their website leading to disappointment. We got an opportunity to see only the animal rescue centre where we saw a few Himalayan black bears and 2 leopards.BHAGYALAKSHMI I — Google reviewDachigam Park is a nice place to visit, especially if you enjoy nature and peaceful surroundings. It’s a good spot for a walk, with fresh air and scenic views.

In terms of wildlife, the park mainly houses Brown Bears, Black Bears, and Leopards, along with a fish farm. While it’s interesting, the variety of animals is quite limited.

Overall, it’s a good place to explore, though not the most exciting if you’re expecting a wide range of wildlife. Still, it’s worth a visit for the natural beauty and quiet atmosphere.Numan K — Google reviewLocated on outskirts of Srinagar city, Dachigam covers an area of around 141 square kilometers, it is best known for its population of the endangered Hangul deer, but you will be lucky to spot one. It is mostly visited for few caged bears and Leopard and a large Trout fish farm. My recommendation is keep a full day for this place.

.IRSHAD I — Google review"Achabal Garden is an absolutely beautiful spot adorned with vibrant flowers and towering Chinar trees. The garden’s charm is enhanced by the serene spring water that flows throughout in three streams, creating a peaceful atmosphere. The presence of old Mughal structures adds a historical touch, reminding visitors that this garden was built by Mughal Empress Nur Jahan in 1620. It's truly an incredible place to relax and appreciate nature. However, the only downside is the lack of dustbins across the garden. There should be dustbins on each tier to maintain cleanliness."Bilal S — Google review**“Achabal Garden is an absolutely beautiful spot adorned with vibrant flowers and towering Chinar trees.

It turned out to be one of the most breathtaking autumn experiences I’ve ever had.Tabrez A — Google reviewSpend ur last day of Pahalgam by visiting
here. U will love the place.  Calm yet lively. Natural and beautiful.  The loudness of water streams makes stones of the park alive. It’s not the noise of water but the voice of the garden.  Garden made in 4 steps as represents Mughal architecture.   Waterways devide  the entire garden very sophistically. Best thing is that u will not find any tourist here.  Most of the locals visit this place.  Waterways have swift water flow so be careful for ur children and for urself. And don’t be in hurry else u will not be able to have a conversation with Theo’s beautiful garden. Please keeep it clean.Ankur K — Google reviewAchbal Garden, located in the lush region of Kashmir, is a historical garden that epitomizes the elegance and serenity typical of Mughal horticultural design.
