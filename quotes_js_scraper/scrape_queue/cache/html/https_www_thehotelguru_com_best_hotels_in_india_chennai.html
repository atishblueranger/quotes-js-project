About Chennai

Known as the ‘Capital of the South’, Chennai is the capital of Tamil Nadu. After lagging behind for some years it has finally caught up with its megalopolis rivals and is now something of a cosmopolitan business hub boasting the big name hotels, restaurants and bars that soon follow. Formerly known as Madras, it was once a primary trading post of the East India Trading Company. Today it is an intoxicating blend of chai stalls, bustling traffic with cows meandering alongside, sprawling shopping malls, five star hotels and clubs that are open until the small hours. The Hotel Guru's pick of the best places to stay in Chennai combine the best in modern and traditional.
A walk along the winding streets of George Town is an exciting experience. Built in 1644 and the historic heart of the city, it is home to St. George’s Fort which now houses a museum detailing the city’s turbulent history.
The Kapaleeshwarar Temple, with incredible carved and painted gods, exhibits some impressive craftsmanship and St. Mary’s church some pioneering architecture.
If you prefer something a little more low key, relax with a leisurely stroll along the Marina Beach overlooking the Bay of Bengal.
For the best in South Indian cuisine head to Dakshin. Flute and tabla musicians accompany your food and there is an extensive wine and whisky list. The fish curries are a speciality.
With temperatures in the 30s and upwards almost all year round, the most forgiving months to visit Chennai are between December and February when you may just get away with highs in the late twenties.
What not to miss:


Visit the Kapaleeshwarar Temple, with its incredible carved and painted gods.


Walk along the winding streets of George Town and get a glimpse of city life.


Spend an afternoon at the Theosophical Society Gardens.


Take a heritage walk through Madras High Court.
