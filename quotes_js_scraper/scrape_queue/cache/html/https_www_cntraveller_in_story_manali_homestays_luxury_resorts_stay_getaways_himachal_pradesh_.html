The picturesque hill station of Manali has loads to offer through the seasons, and now is the best time to experience the destination in all its glory. We've rounded up a list of resorts, hotels and homestays in and around Manali for your next getaway.Best places to stay in ManaliVastiMohit SrivastavaVasti means ‘home’ in Sanskrit, and that is an apt name for host Mayuri Sinha’s charming homestay in the quiet village of Bathar, sandwiched between Manali and Naggar. The red-and-orange roofed cottage set against the mountains is a safe space for travellers to experience slow, deliberate living in the hills. “We want this place to feel like a home. We do not operate like a typical business. Our homestay is only listed on Airbnb and we are also selective about who we allow into our space,” says Sinha, adding that women travellers and families are prioritised. Set amidst apple orchards, Vasti is located about 11kms away from the Mall Road in Manali in Bathar village. Sinha wanted a space that wasn't too far from Manali and yet offered an escape from the crowds. The two-storeyed wood and stone structure has three guest bedrooms, a living room and dining space, a kitchen garden, and a studio where travellers can dabble in pottery or paint on canvas. On the lower floor is a room that Sinha generally lets out to women travellers during off-season months, as the host herself lives in the same space. The cuisine is largely homestyle, with both vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis on offer. There's also an option to sample Pahadi cuisine with siddu (steamed bun with walnut filling), madra (a yoghurt-based curry) and Pahadi-style veggies or meat. There are several walking trails and hikes, ranging from easy 20-minute strolls to hour-and-a-half walks to gurgling forest streams. For an immersion in Himachali culture, walk through the Bathar village and have lunch at a local’s home. -Geetika SachdevDoubles from Rs7,000*/night inclusive of taxes (for the room on the lower floor); Rs 20,000*/night inclusive of taxes for the entire cottage. Minimum stay two nights.plan your stayHunzuruYash JainSituated in Pangan, a hamlet within Manali but distanced from the town's more crowded areas, Hunzuru is a consciously designed homestay built out of mud and stone. The five-bedroom homestay is built with the wabi-sabi philosophy that celebrates imperfections. Expect stone walls, handcrafted furniture, and muted natural colours across the 3,500sqft space that’s spread across three levels. Large windows open to panoramic mountain views throughout the house. There’s plenty to do in and around the homestay. Drive through the Atal Tunnel to Sissu or to the busier parts of Manali for some shopping or cute cafés, enjoy hikes to nearby waterfalls and villages, or take a day trip to Naggar.Doubles from Rs6,299plan your stayHygge HouseThe quaint four-bedroom cottage—solely for exclusive bookings—sits in the serene setting of Raison, steeped in the pastoral charm of the surrounding fruit farm and a cluster of villages on the banks of the Beas River, about 27km (an hour’s drive) from Manali. When you enter, you immediately notice the array of panoramic windows throughout the home, which might as well be postcards, framing the picturesque Pir Panjal range of the Lower Himalayas from ample angles; the mountains whispering for you to unwind in this kind cradle of pristine nature. The two-storey cottage is rustic, yet it is imbued with a healthy dash of understated elegance in its open-plan living and dining rooms, floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the orchard and mountains, and a wrap-around verandah and an open-air sit-out surrounded by fruit trees. The bedrooms feature unique touches that distinguish them, and each is named after a flower that grows on the property: Tulip and Iris are on the ground level, while Daffodil and Bluebell are on the first floor. Breakfast is complimentary and lunch and dinner are served on request. Highlights from Hygge House’s food offerings are the egg masala curry, kadai chicken, bhature served with bhaji, kadhi pakora, rajma chawal, matar paneer, and the Himachali dham. Guests can explore the surrounding villages and towns or relax at the property with books and board games. Spend your time spotting birds like red-billed blue magpies or Himalayan bulbul at the property, tour the orchard, or enjoy a lazy picnic lunch by the river. Pallavi MehraHygge House is only rented out in its entirety. The tariff per night is Rs30,000 for up to six guests and Rs36,000 for eight guests.Sitara HimalayaHimanshu Lakhwani Ever the creative, Anita Lal, founder of India’s iconic lifestyle brand Good Earth, channelled her alchemist’s heart into a new 10-bedroom garden retreat immersed in the spiritual magnitude of the Himalayas last year. Sitara Himalaya is located at an altitude of 8,200 feet, 13km (about a 90-minute drive) from Manali, on the way to the ancient Buddhist valleys of Lahaul and Spiti. Ten spacious bedrooms (five downstairs, five upstairs) are covered in varying shades of a hand-spun Banarasi silk wallpaper depicting a sacred Buddhist motif of a Himalayan cloud. Up in the clouds is where guests sleep. Opening the curtains to a view of snow-capped peaks and the purity of light and air is an immediate uplift. Don’t expect room service menus, mini-bars, or TVs. Instead, there’s a dedicated library space, painted in teal and sky blue with red accents in homage to Buddhist monasteries. One gets the feeling you could settle into a new way of life here. Read a little more, sleep a little more, dream a little more, do nothing a little more.
