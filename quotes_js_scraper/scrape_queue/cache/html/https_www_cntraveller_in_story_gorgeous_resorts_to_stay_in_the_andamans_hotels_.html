But a beach holiday on an island is even better. With white sand beaches, mangroves and lush tropical rainforests, the Andamans provide the perfect escape. Water babies will appreciate the opportunities to dive—the Andamans have some of the best dive sites in the country—and those who prefer staying on the shores will enjoy the pristine sands of Radhanagar Beach.What’s the best time to visit the Andamans?The tropical island has just two seasons: summer and monsoon, so don’t expect cool weather at any point of the year. The best time to visit the Andamans is between October and April. During this time, weather fluctuations tend to be at their lowest and skies are relatively clear. While October to April is peak season, November to January are the best months to visit for pleasant sunny days, without excess heat or humidity. There’s plenty to do in the popular island of Havelock, from cool intertidal walks with a marine life expert at Radhanagar Beach to jungle trails where you can make friends with the neon green Andaman day gecko or the golden-eyed Andaman Hawk Owl.

Tucked within the fold of banana trees and lily ponds, accommodations are spread across double-storey units of four rooms each, with thatched roofs and private balconies overlooking the palm-lined pool, or offering glimpses of the sea through the trees. The breezy dining space opens out into the canopy of a mango tree, and features a menu of Indian and Continental staples with a focus on seafood.
