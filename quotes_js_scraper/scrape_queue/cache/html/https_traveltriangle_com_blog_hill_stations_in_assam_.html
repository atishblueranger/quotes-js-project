Best Time To Visit Assam 


 Summer season,  which runs from April to June is the best time to visit Assam. These months are extremely pleasant and refreshing to travel. The climate is also ideal for  wildlife safari in Kaziranga National Park  (UNESCO World Heritage Site) and hill stations like Haflong, Diphu, and Maibang.
Assam is located on the Brahmaputra valley, which is prone to torrential rain and devastating floods, so  monsoon season  from July to September must be avoided.
Winter months  in Assam from October to March are comfortable and perfect for a romantic vacation. One can enjoy festivals like Bihu—harvest festival in January— or visit the Orchids in the hills and enjoy the chilling weather.
