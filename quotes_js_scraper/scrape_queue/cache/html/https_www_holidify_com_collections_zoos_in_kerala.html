 5. Abhayaranyam Zoo, Ernakulam 






 Often known for Elephants in the state, the Abhayaranyam mini zoo is located at Kaprikkad village in Ernakulam district. The zoo is part of an ecotourism project which aims at rehabilitation of Elephants from the Kodanad Elephant Training center due to lack of space for accommodating the increased number of animals. Apart from elephants, there are other animals as well, which are housed in the zoo, which is going to be maintained like a wildlife safari, ensuring that the animals are left to their natural habitat.
