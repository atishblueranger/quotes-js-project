The grand two-storey home was the Secretariat when Lord Auckland was Governor General. It saw the British sign the Simla Manifesto in 1838 to reinstate the deposed king of Kabul. Hundred years later, Raja Charanjit Singh of Kapurthala bought and refurbished the stone building as his summer home. His grandson Ratanjit "Reggie" Singh, now the owner, says that there has been no renovation since. Chapslee has the mind-bending qualities of a time machine—though it's only a short walk from the city centre. A stunning blood-red Murano chandelier fills your vision as you enter. Old hunting trophies, weapons and family portraits line the walls. Elegant powder rooms flank four-poster beds with gleaming fireplaces. Meals are equally a production with silver service and liveried staff. And there's always time for a spot of croquet on the lawns, watched over by Chapslee's affable dogs; doubles from Rs12,200, including breakfast.Make a reservationSanjiv's Aira Holme Retreat, Chotta ShimlaSanjiv's Aira Holme Retreat, Chotta ShimlaAn idyllic pocket of charm in Chotta Shimla, Sanjiv's Aira Holme Retreat is a 10min drive from the city centre.
