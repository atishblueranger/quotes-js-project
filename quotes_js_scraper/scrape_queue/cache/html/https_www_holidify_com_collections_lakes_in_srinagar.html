 Lakes in Srinagar 














Here is the list of 4 Lakes in Srinagar



 1. Dal Lake, Srinagar

 The Jewel of Srinagar, the Dal Lake is synonymous to a visit to Srinagar and is almost a visual definition of the town. Spread over 15 kms, it is the second-largest lake in Jammu & Kashmir. The mirror-like Dal Lake reflects the snow-dusted peaks of the Pir Panjal mountains while the colourful shikaras (gondolas) float around. The houseboats and shikaras are its main attractions.

 2. Wular Lake, Srinagar

 Wular Lake is the largest freshwater lake in India, spread across 200 sq km. Located in the Bandipora district of Srinagar, the lake's basin was formed as a result of tectonic activity, due to which the area covered by the lake varies throughout the year, a phenomenon which is unique to this destination. Wular Lake is popular for boating, water sports and water skiing and is a popular sunset point.

 3. Nigeen Lake, Srinagar 





4.2
 /5



 Considered a part of Dal Lake and connected to it via a narrow strait, the Nigeen Lake of Srinagar is a mildly eutrophic lake. It offers a peaceful and mesmerizing experience and is known for activities like diving, swimming, and boating. The mirror-like image of polar and willow trees in Nigeen Lake is simply breathtaking. 









 4. Manasbal Lake, Srinagar 







 Manasbal Lake, situated in the picturesque Ganderbal District of Jammu and Kashmir, derives its name from the revered Lake Manasarovar. Encircled by the villages of Jarokbal, Kondabal, and Ganderbal, it claims the title of India's deepest lake, with a depth of 13 meters. The Mughal garden, Jaroka, built by Nur Jahan, adds to the lake's allure, offering a stunning view of its clear waters.
