But what makes this place truly magical is the way it transforms with the changing light of the day. From the first rays of the sun that paint the sky in golden hues to the last glimmers of the twilight that cast a soft glow on the hills, Meghalaya offers some of the most stunning views of scarlet sunrise and sunset. Whether you wish to be hiking all the way up with your partner to witness a mesmerizing sunrise or drowning all your worries down with a dreamy sunset, you will always find a spot that matches your mood in Meghalaya. And it's true - the best things in life come in small packages. Just like watching a crimson sun with your sweetheart in the heavenly abode of clouds makes the dopamine level soar tenfold… So, here's a list of all the best sunset &amp;amp; sunrise spots to witness the dawn and dusk in Meghalaya. Have a look! Sunrise Spots 1. Nongjrong This is a newly explored place in Meghalaya, just 60 km from Shillong. It is best known for its breathtaking view of the sunrise over the clouds and hills. You can also see the Bangladesh plains from here. 2. Laitlum Canyon This is a hidden gem in Meghalaya, located about 25 km from Shillong. It is a vast valley that is covered with mist and fog most of the time, offering a breathtaking view of the rolling hills, rocky cliffs, and winding streams. You can also see the small village of Rasong at the bottom of the valley, which is accessible only by foot. The canyon is a perfect place to enjoy some solitude and peace. Visit it during sunrise, when the mist clears up and reveals the beauty of the landscape. 3. Shillong Peak This is the highest point in Meghalaya, located about 10 km from Shillong city. It offers a panoramic view of the entire city and the plains of Bangladesh. You can also see the Himalayan peaks on a clear day. The best time to visit is during sunrise, when the city lights up and the horizon glows with different shades. 4. Mawlynnong This is the cleanest village in Asia, where you can experience the rural life of Meghalaya. The village is surrounded by greenery and flowers and has a watchtower that offers a splendid view of the sunrise overlooking the plains of Bangladesh. 5. Mawphanlur This is a hidden gem in Meghalaya, where you can find seven lakes and rolling hills. The place is serene and peaceful, and the sunrise here is magical. You can also camp here and enjoy the starry night sky. Meghalaya Waterfall Hopping: A 3-Day Guide To The Most Stunning Cascades In The Abode Of Clouds Sunset Spots 1. Umiam Lake, Meghalaya This is a large man-made lake that is surrounded by lush green hills. It is a popular destination for boating, kayaking, and fishing. But the best time to visit this lake is during sunset, when the water reflects the colours of the sky and creates a mesmerizing sight. You can also enjoy a picnic or a bonfire by the lake shore and soak in the serene atmosphere. 2. Elephant Falls This is a three-tiered waterfall near Shillong, where you can admire the beauty and power of nature. The waterfall is especially stunning during sunset, when the sun rays create a rainbow effect on the spray. 3. Seven Sisters Falls This is a spectacular waterfall in Cherrapunji, where you can see seven streams of water falling from a height of over 300 meters. The waterfall is also known as Nohsngithiang Falls, and is best viewed during sunset, when the sun casts a golden glow on the water. 4. Dawki River This is a small town on the border of India and Bangladesh, located about 80 km from Shillong. It is famous for its crystal clear river Umngot, which flows through a deep gorge. The river is so transparent that you can see the bottom of it and the boats floating on it look like they are flying in mid-air. Visit it during sunset, when the river sparkles with light and creates a magical effect. 5. Garo Hills This is a range of hills in the western part of Meghalaya, where you can find diverse flora and fauna, rich culture and heritage, and stunning landscapes. The sunset here is amazing, as you can see the sun setting behind the hills and creating a dramatic effect on the sky. So, what about you?
