We have put together some of the highlights of the town below, but we suggest that you check out our complete guide to Pondicherry before visiting. You can also book a private sightseeing tour of Pondicherry here.

The Promenade Beach, also called Rock Beach, is perfect for a long romantic walk. Experience a breathtaking sunset while you indulge in a delectable cup of coffee by the beach at Le Café or dine at the Bay of Buddha beachfront restaurant.
The boat ride to Paradise Island Beach offers a mesmerizing view of scenic landscapes that leaves you wanting more. The best way to get there is by taking the ferry or motorboat service from the Chunnambar Boat House.
Experience French culture at its best as you walk down the cobbled streets of White Town. Marvel at the colorful French styled-villas, get some Insta-worthy pictures and enjoy the authentic cuisine at courtyard restaurants and cafes such as the Celine’s Kitchen and Coromandel Cafe. Their wood-fired pizzas are definitely worth a try. And before you leave Pondicherry, enjoy a traditional French breakfast at Baker Street with mouth-watering croissants, quiches, baguettes, macarons and many more.
One of the greatest spiritual destinations, the Sri Aurobindo Ashram attracts spiritual seekers worldwide for its peaceful, meditative environment. Amongst its many departments, the ashram has a library where you can read all of Sri Aurobindo’s works and a publication department from where you can buy them. Timings: 8 am – 12 pm and 2 pm – 6 pm.
The church of Sacred Heart Basilica in South Boulevard is a marvelous display of Gothic architecture that appeals to all art lovers. You can visit it on all days between 5 am and 8 pm.
A trip to Pondicherry is not complete until you visit the quaint, soulful town of Auroville, established by people from 50 countries in pursuit of peace and harmony. Its streets display small boutique shops selling casual, bohemian attire and Ayurvedic wellness products. Auroville’s quaint eateries are also a must-visit. The main attractions of Auroville include the Matrimandir, Auroville Bakery, and the Sound Garden.
Let your trip include a quick temple run to the 500-year-old Arulmigu Manakula Vinayagar Temple located in White Town. The main attractions of this vibrant pilgrimage site are the temple’s gold laminated pillars and the chariot of Lord Ganesha which is built of teak wood and about 7.5 kg of gold! 
Shop for hip outfits, accessories and decor at Mission Street and the many local boutiques.

TWT tip: Regardless of the season, Pondicherry weather before sunset can be quite sultry and humid. So consume a lot of liquids to keep yourself hydrated and hire a bike if you want to avoid long walks during the day.
