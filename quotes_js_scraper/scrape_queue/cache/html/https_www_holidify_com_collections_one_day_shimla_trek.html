The trek starts from Narkanda, which is 63 km away from Shimla and ends at Hatu Mata Temple that is perched upon the top of the hill, making a fitting finale to the trek. For a more immersive experience, trekkers can camp for the night near the peak.Difficulty Level: Easy to ModerateTotal Distance: 7 km
