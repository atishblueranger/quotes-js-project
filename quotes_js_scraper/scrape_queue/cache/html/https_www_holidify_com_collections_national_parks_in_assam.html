 Beautiful National Parks in Assam 

    
         A hotspot for biodiversity, it is only natural that some of India's most important national parks are in Assam. Two-thirds of the world's population of one-horned rhinoceros are found at the famous K (Read More)aziranga National Park while Manas National Park is a tiger and elephant reserve, both landing on UNESCO's list of World Heritage Sites. The National Parks of Assam like Dibru Saikhowa and Nameri showcase the beautifully preserved exotic wildlife of the Himalayas and the North Eastern Valley. The best time to visit the national parks in Assam is anywhere from November to April. Since the whole of Assam receives a major rainfall in the monsoon and the pre-monsoon time of the year, the national parks tend to flood in the months of June, July and August. The water starts receding in September and October and the place is open to tourism from November again. 













Here is the list of 8 National Parks in Assam You Must Visit
