The service is outstanding, food is flavorful, and the rooms are beautifully designed. The peaceful ambiance makes it ideal for relaxation. It’s also a great place to explore the local culture and enjoy a royal experience.Abhishek S — Google reviewThank you for sharing your wonderful experience! We're glad to hear that you found the triple room outstanding and that our front desk staff were supportive during the heavy downpour. It's great to know you enjoyed the complimentary breakfast as well. We appreciate your warm wishes and hope to welcome you back soon! Safe travels!

Kind Regards,

Grande InnAravind M — Google reviewWe had a lovely central room no balcony (lots of pigeons on the balconies it seemed to us). The facilities and room were all Oberoi luxury but what always separates out Oberoi is the sheer attention to great service.
The bar isn’t really separate from the lobby and neither comfortable nor atmospheric whereas the sitting room on the other side is both - we took our cocktails to go and went to our room with its peerless view of the Taj.
The breakfast room is a wee bit crowded but the food good (melon not ripe enough) and the egg and Indian dishes we had were top notch.
It has one of the nicest pools we have ever seen with the trickling of water and fountains with gorgeously pretty umbrellas. The service at the pool, as elsewhere was impeccable.
Nowhere better to stay for the Taj.Cas A — Google reviewWhat a place. The food was amazing. The setting so impressive. The service and welcoming staff made the stay so special. The grounds are wonderful. Looking out over the trees and seeing the Taj Mahal is something else!Mike P — Google reviewIndeed this could be a very Wonderful place if they improve there workplace behaviour, the behavior of one of there main entry gate staff members during my recent visit to the hotel on 16 AUGUST . Despite the hotel's reputation for exceptional service, I encountered an unfortunate incident that left a negative impression.

During my visit I was met with an unprofessional and argumentative attitude. The staff member's behavior was not only unhelpful but also confrontational, and I was shocked when they threatened to involve local authorities and issue a challan for settling my family in car on gate.

I understand that mistakes can happen, but the staff member's demeanor and tone were unacceptable. As a guest, I expect a certain level of respect and courtesy, which was lacking in this interaction.

I would appreciate it if they could look into this matter and take necessary steps .Muhammad D — Google reviewWe stayed at this beautiful hotel for a night, their service was amazing overall.
We booked a stay including breakfast and dinner, however the staff at the dinner restaurant charged us. I was not sure at that time about my booking was including dinner, so I paid the fee.
Next morning, I reached to concierge, then she told me they’ll refund our dinner which is we paid double.
Restaurant manager apologized us and he said refund would be completed within 14 days.
However, it’s already over one month past, I still didn’t get the refund yet.

It's a shame that their dishonesty response made my nice memory of India into a bad one.A — Google reviewOur stay had some lovely moments.
- Stunning views and a truly exceptional Taj Mahal guide
- Staff were genuinely trying their best especially Stanley the driver from the airport.
- Some delicious food (desserts were a highlight!)
Definitely the hotel to stay in if your visiting the Taj Mahal.Victoria G — Google reviewThis is to convey my sincere appreciation for the outstanding hospitality extended to us during our recent stay at The Oberoi Amarvilas.

From the moment we arrived, every detail — from the warm welcome to the impeccable service — reflected the highest standards of excellence that The Oberoi Group is renowned for. The entire staff was courteous, attentive, and ensured that our experience was truly memorable.

I would especially like to extend my heartfelt thanks to Mr. Aiswarya, whose professionalism, grace, and personal attention to every aspect of our stay truly stood out. His thoughtful gestures and proactive approach made us feel genuinely cared for when we missed our flight, and elevated our overall experience immensely. It is rare to witness such dedication and hospitality, and Mr. Aiswarya is a remarkable ambassador of your brand. Surely in future I will look out for Oberoi first to whichever place we travel.

Please convey our gratitude to the entire team. We will always remember our time at The Oberoi Amarvilas with fondness and look forward to visiting again.Veeru S — Google reviewTaj East Gate Rd, Paktola, Tajganj, Agra, Uttar Pradesh 282001, India•https://www.oberoihotels.com/hotels-in-agra-amarvilas-resort/?ut…•+91 562 223 1515•Tips and more reviews for The Oberoi Amarvilas, Agra2Hotel Clarks Shiraz, AgraSave4.2(9120)•Mentioned on +7 other lists HotelHotel Clarks Shiraz in Agra is a luxurious five-star hotel located just 2 km from the iconic Taj Mahal. With 237 well-appointed rooms, it caters to both business and leisure travelers. The hotel offers top-notch hospitality, delectable cuisine, and a coffee shop. Guests can enjoy an outdoor pool, spa facilities, and various indoor games.Our recent stay at Hotel Clarks Shiraz was an excellent experience. Located conveniently near the Taj Mahal, the hotel offers a luxurious yet comfortable experience ideal for both families and couples.

From the moment we arrived, the hospitality of the staff stood out. The front desk team was warm, welcoming, and quick with check-in. Special thanks to Mr Sonu Sharma and his team who were always courteous and ready to assist with any request — whether it was arranging transport, managing luggage, or providing local guidance.

The rooms were spacious, clean, and well-appointed, offering a great view and a peaceful ambiance. The swimming pool area was well-maintained and perfect for a relaxing afternoon. The hotel also follows proper hygiene protocols, which made us feel very safe and cared for.

Food at the in-house restaurants was another highlight. The buffet spread offered a wide variety of Indian and continental dishes, all delicious and freshly prepared. The restaurant staff were attentive and ensured we were well looked after.

Overall, Clarks Shiraz combines old-world charm with modern comfort and exceptional service. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Agra, especially for those looking to relax in a premium setting after sightseeing.Javed R — Google reviewDisappointing Experience – Definitely Not a 5-Star Hotel

Checked in this afternoon (5/3/25) at Clarks Shiraz Agra, and I genuinely question how this hotel has been categorized as 5-star. From the moment we arrived, the experience was underwhelming. The reception staff showed little to no genuine interest, making for an unwelcoming first impression.

The room itself was disappointing—basic amenities, only one side of the bed had a side table, and the shower was not properly cleaned. Even worse, the wash basin had stagnant water, which is completely unacceptable for a hotel of this standard.

Room service was also below par. Our order arrived 13 minutes late with no apology, and the tray mat was old and dirty, further adding to the poor experience.

The buffet breakfast at Checkers was, without a doubt, the worst we’ve ever had in a 4-5 star hotel. The food quality, variety, and overall experience were far below expectations, making it a major disappointment.

Unfortunately, I cannot find anything positive about this stay. The hotel is nowhere near the 5-star standard it claims to be. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a true luxury experience.Ajith C — Google reviewThis place is amazing especially their food, extremely tasty. They have game rooms and pools which are nice to have as well as a gym that's basic but works. The service as well is top notch.Jay V — Google reviewHotel rooms nice enough. A little tired.
Went to breakfast buffet after Taj Mahal visit. Was good selection but little left (10 am). Tables were not being cleaned and cutlery not being replaced.
What annoyed me most was the shops inside hotel. I didn’t expect to be heckled to buy something. Bad enough outside without having to deal with it inside. Would not stay here again.Chris F — Google reviewThe hotel is set in beautiful, expansive grounds with an impressive and elegant building. The common areas are well-designed and stylish, fitting for a five-star establishment. Our room was comfortable and nicely appointed, but it could benefit from an upgrade to include power outlets on both sides of the bed, rather than just one.

Unfortunately, our experience at the Checkers buffet significantly impacted our stay. The ambiance was lacking, with outdated decor and a poorly thought-out layout. The food was merely adequate and did not meet the quality expected from a five-star hotel, especially compared to similar establishments I have visited.

Additionally, hygiene concerns were apparent as flies were spotted settling on food, which was quite off-putting. The staff appeared overstretched and disengaged, with tables often missing basic items like crockery and cutlery. The overall experience at the buffet was disappointing and certainly not up to the standards expected at a luxury hotel.

While the setting and design of the hotel are commendable, improvements to dining quality, hygiene, and staff attentiveness are necessary to justify its five-star rating.SearchEX T — Google reviewWorst 5 star hotel.. dont go here....no variety in food .....my brother wedding happened here... rooms r very congested... foul smell from foods.  No variety in desserts also.....i don't know why they call themselves 5 star.  Services like 1 starDharampal M — Google reviewGood fine dine option in Agra.
Excellent service. Mr Ramu was courteous and polite. Good ambience and love music, accompanied by excellent cuisine.Shah A — Google reviewIts the worst hotel I have experienced. Last in december we had our 1st wedding at home.
My reviews regard Clarks Shiraz are-
1. Room sizes are small.
2. Worst communication between staff                and even their managers.
3. The main point of all which everyone should consider is that the food, they have zero taste in food even the food from a punjabi dhaba is better than theirs.
4. Their lift always had technical issues
and the foremost thing is that their technicians also don’t know how to fix it.
5. They didn’t even work as per agreement and the reason they mentioned that “ Our team forgot to do that” 😂😂.

Conclusion: I personally do not recommend to have ur wedding ceremonies here because its once in a lifetime event so think before booking. U can visit different hotel in same area “ Fatehabad” and i asure u will have better or even best option than Clark Shiraz.Yuvvraj K — Google review54, Taj Rd, Agra Cantt, Idgah Colony, Agra, Uttar Pradesh 282001, India•http://www.hotelclarksshiraz.com/•+91 562 222 6120•Tips and more reviews for Hotel Clarks Shiraz, AgraNeed a place to stay?WhereWhen9/23–9/24Navigate forward to interact with the calendar and select a date.

Breakfast buffet was varied and had multiple options for Continental as well as Indian, as well as healthy options. Facilities were also good. Rooms are spacious. Will visit again.Mithila M — Google reviewWe were there to attend a wedding. The hotel was great and we were greeted very warmly. Rooms were also nice and spacious with all the basic amenities. The day we checked in , we were provided with lunch and then evening snacks which were not matching like 5 star food. It was very ok ok. Infact even the food served at the time of wedding was also very below average and we couldn't digest that we are in 5star hotel. Even the staff who were serving were not trained enough and doesn't look likes a hotel parmanent employee.For e.g.For Soup, I just asked for pepper powder but they couldn't understand,  and they didn't even bothered to take care of my request.
On contrary breakfast was just next to awesome with highly trained staff serving us. The breakfast buffet was vast and it was delicious just like you expect it with standards. In fact I would rate it better than other 5 stars hotel breakfast buffet.
One more good point is about there kids room which was really better.
I would still recommend this hotel as my family had great time there plus there security and child friendly ambience was good.
So looks like for wedding package they have outsourced catering it, which is totally my assumption. If not so then Hotel need to work on their wedding staff and quality of food.Neetika K — Google reviewExtremely Disappointed – Worst Experience Ever

This was by far the worst service I’ve encountered. The staff was completely unprofessional and lacked basic hospitality etiquette. Despite being present at the dinner table, we were ignored multiple times and had to keep calling for attention—only to be met with indifference.

There was no sense of coordination among the team. No one seemed to know what they were doing, and there was absolutely no management oversight. Basic requests took ages, and when they did arrive, the attitude was careless.

It felt like we were doing them a favor by being there, not the other way around. Truly a waste of time, money, and expectations. I would strongly advise others to think twice before visiting. A complete letdown.Harkirat L — Google reviewWe had excellent time in this hotel...Rooms.. services are very good. The hotel is well maintained. Everyone is very helpful over there, each and every one is behaved very well, special mention about Ms. Juli, nice and very helpful girl. Food is also tasty.. Great experience!Sushmaa S — Google reviewDuring dinner, I noticed that all the tourists (from other countries) were given different water, while the locals received the free one.
Of course, we paid for it, it’s not about the money, but the discrimination.
The buffet dinner is really worth it; you can try a variety of flavors. The hotel also offered discount for this.
The staff is very kind, but unfortunately, they forgot things, so we were disturbed in our room several times.
They also asked if we wanted to upgrade our room for an additional fee.
We declined the offer, but about an hour later, we were informed that they had upgraded us for free.
Most likely, they no longer had the type of room we originally booked available.
I hope it was just a coincidence that they first asked if we wanted to pay for the more expensive room, which we ended up getting for free.
Overall, it's a quiet and clean hotel.Bernadett K — Google reviewWe had a very nice stay here, the rooms are clean and the staff are very friendly. We also enjoyed the breakfast and dinner buffet.

This hotel delivers five-star service from the moment you step onto the property. This is my fifth time staying here, and it truly gets better with each visit. The entrance gives you a real appreciation for Indian architecture and splendor. The reception staff is very focused on customer service and makes sure every detail of your stay is taken care of. I loved my room. It was spacious, elegant, and had a bathtub fit for a king. The mini fridge kept my drinks cold, and the wireless internet was strong enough for Zoom meetings without any issues. The grounds of the hotel are exceptional, with beautiful landscaping and quiet areas to relax. I used the fitness center multiple times and loved the fact that even if it is closed after hours, the staff will gladly open it for you. That flexibility made me feel truly taken care of. The pools are also clean and refreshing, perfect after a long day of sightseeing. The Executive Club Lounge is another highlight. The service is excellent, and the staff pays attention to what you like. There are so many positives about this hotel that I could keep going. From the thoughtful service to the world-class facilities, everything about the ITC Mughal stands out. It truly remains one of my favorite places to stay in the world.Raymond G — Google reviewITC Mughal is located in a very nice area, and it’s quite convenient to reach.
As soon as you arrive, you’ll find the architecture truly worthy of its name. I loved the ambience and the sense of grandeur, which beautifully complements the old-school royalty of Agra.
I visited for a weekend getaway with my family, and it was a great experience. The food was delicious and surprisingly reasonably priced, and the service was excellent.
The only thing stopping me from giving it a 5-star rating is that the main course wasn’t as impressive as the starters.
However, that’s not going to stop me from going again — in fact, we had already planned our next visit before we left.
ITC Mughal, you’ve earned a permanent visitor today!Shreesh P — Google reviewI was pretty chuffed about my 36 hour getaway to Agra and was looking forward to staying at ITC Mughal’s suite.
First off, the property is well maintained, spacious, and provides scenic views of the city and the Taj Mahal.
The food was pretty average and definitely not worth the price paid. On the other hand, the in-room dining menu had a decent amount of options, yet the bar menu did not.
Service was excellent and the staff — including our TM tour guide who didn’t bore us — was quite courteous and helpful.
Overall, a good stay, but the food and menu need to be worked upon.Samaira A — Google reviewWe had a wonderful experience at ITC Mughal, Agra. Before arriving, we requested a room upgrade and some birthday arrangements for my brother — and the team went above and beyond. Not only did they upgrade our room, but they surprised us with two cakes (one in the room and one outside with special decorations).

A truly heartwarming moment was when the chef personally came out for the cake cutting and made the celebration even more special. At checkout, the staff also took detailed feedback about our experience, which shows how much they genuinely care.

Exceptional service, warm hospitality, and thoughtful gestures throughout. Highly recommend for a special occasion or a luxurious stay in Agra.Sameer S — Google reviewJust back from the most amazing stay at ITC Mughal, Agra – it was truly too too too good! 💖

We loved the horse riding, swimming, magic show, and fun caricature art – perfect for families! The staff went above and beyond, decorating our room and even giving us a complimentary upgrade. 🥹✨

The hospitality, food, and royal vibe made it an unforgettable experience. Highly recommended! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟Kirat K — Google reviewThe biggest scam during our 3-week trip to India

The hotel is a only shadow of itself compared to pictures. From the outside - imagine a rundown corporate headquarter, this is exactly what will meet you.

Spa pool was occupied with families with small kids - no chance of relaxing, so we had to escape. Staff is very kind as always in India, but the food is overpriced and overall look&feel of the hotel only reminds you of the office you need to go back to after your holidays.

Stay away from this place and look at some of the smaller boutique hotels in town - regret we didn’t choose one of these.

After a wonderful 3 week vacation to India this hotel was supposed to wrap up our trip before going back to Europe…  but instead we tried to escape it by wandering into town, spending limiting time here.Stine K — Google reviewWe had a wonderful stay and were truly impressed by the hospitality! A special shoutout to two amazing staff members who went above and beyond — Mr Suman & Ms Pranika kindly looked after my dog while my family dined at the restaurant (since pets weren’t allowed inside), which meant the world to us. It’s rare to come across such thoughtful and dedicated service. Thank you for making our experience so smooth and memorable. Highly recommended!Yashika K — Google reviewWe had a wonderful stay at ITC Mughal, Agra, and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for luxury combined with warm hospitality. The property is absolutely stunning – a lush green, sprawling campus with well-designed infrastructure that ensures comfort even in Agra’s peak summer heat.

The hotel offers two amazing swimming pools, complete with excellent facilities like spacious changing rooms, clothes dryers, and comfortable lounging areas. There’s also a horse-riding experience, a lovely play area for kids, and an exotic food menu with an incredible variety of options in every meal – enough to delight every palate.

What truly stood out during our stay was the exceptional service from the entire team. Every staff member, at every level, was courteous, respectful, and always greeted us with a warm smile, making us feel genuinely welcome.

A special mention to Mr. Tilak Singh and Mr. Ashutosh from the hospitality team, who went above and beyond to assist us even after our stay. I had accidentally left my Milton steel water bottle near the poolside, and thanks to his prompt and thoughtful support, it was safely delivered to my address in Delhi within just 3 days. Such personal attention and care reflect the high standards ITC upholds for its guests. These thoughtful gestures truly demonstrate their commitment to creating memorable experiences.

One of the highlights was the beautifully maintained rooftop area, which featured a lovely swimming pool and offered a spectacular view of the Taj Mahal. Watching the monument from such a peaceful setting was truly memorable, especially during the early morning and evening hours. The rooftop was well-managed, clean, and designed in a way that felt both relaxing and luxurious.

The rooms were equally impressive—neatly arranged, spacious, and filled with a pleasant fragrance that made the stay even more refreshing. The large windows provided great views, allowing us to enjoy the beauty of the surroundings without even stepping outside. The overall cleanliness was remarkable; everything felt hygienic, from the bedding to the furniture.

The washrooms were spotless and well-equipped, reflecting the hotel’s commitment to guest comfort and hygiene. Attention to detail was evident in every aspect, whether it was the arrangement of amenities, the smooth check-in process, or the polite and helpful attitude of the staff.

Staff very friendly and excellent location for eating and tours options.Jason T — Google reviewI would like to share that our recent experience at your property was, unfortunately, not as good as we had hoped.

Firstly, the initial room we were given did not meet our expectations. Additionally, we were feeling unwell after our plane journey, which made it even more important to have a comfortable and welcoming environment.

The staff behavior also left us disappointed—especially in the restaurant, where one staff member was noticeably unfriendly and did not smile, creating an unwelcoming atmosphere.

On a positive note, we would like to sincerely thank Mr. Vijaya for upgrading our room to the Executive Touch category. We truly appreciate his effort to make our stay more comfortable.

While we are grateful for Mr. Vijaya’s assistance, the overall experience still fell short of what we expected.

The hotel has a warm, charming vibe, and the hospitality has been wonderful. A special mention to Max and Maya, the hotel’s adorable resident dogs—they truly add a unique and welcoming touch!

The lobby is beautiful, and we’re really enjoying the Sky Deck lounge, pool area, children’s play zone, and the restaurant. The food has been excellent with a good range of options.

The service at the hotel is amazing, with that said, there are a few small things that feel short of a true 5-star experience. While the bathrooms are clean, some fixtures are a bit worn—like chrome peeling on faucets and some visible stains. There’s also a faint musty smell in the room, likely from limited ventilation or aging interiors. The blanket is clean but feels slightly coarse and over washed , not quite the soft, high-thread-count quality you’d expect.

We checked in at 3:00 PM and noticed some mosquitoes in the room, which ideally should have been checked and addressed in advance by housekeeping.

These are relatively minor housekeeping and maintenance details, but they do make a difference at this level. That said, the overall ambiance, service, and setting are lovely—and with just a bit more attention to detail, this place could easily feel like a true 5-star stay.Divia J — Google reviewPretty great hotel, love the facilities, but mostly love the service/staff they are very friendly always saying hi especially Mr Amit, almost every single morning he sees me at breakfast and will ask me hows my day and how he could help. Big plus points for the service. Food was great for breakfast but honestly prices for the rooftop restaurant was pretty pricey. Other than that i love my stay.

Truly thank you to all the staff for making my stay a wonderful one.Abdul R — Google reviewThis place has fallen a long way from before covid. Noticeable downfall in quality. Staff quality has detoriated and food quality has detoriated (especially the breakfast and speciality restaurant). Sky deck menus had food splatters. Spa and room service were the only saving grace. Prices are completely unjustified for what you are getting.Jp K — Google reviewStayed July 25 and 26, 2025 – Day 22 and 23 in India

After a long seven-hour drive from Jim Corbett National Park, we arrived at the Taj View Hotel in Agra and were welcomed with warmth and grace. A lovely lady greeted us with a tika and refreshing drinks, which was such a thoughtful and culturally rich touch. The check-in process was seamless and efficient, and we appreciated how easy it all felt after a long day of travel.

Given the hotel’s name, I had my heart set on a room with a view of the Taj Mahal. For some reason, I had really imagined waking up to that iconic sight. So when we entered our room and realized there was no view of the Taj, I felt a bit disappointed. That said, the room itself was clean, comfortable, and perfectly adequate for our needs—nothing fancy, but it served us well.

We enjoyed the breakfast buffet on both mornings of our stay. There was a good variety, and everything was fresh and well-prepared. What really stood out to us throughout the stay was the kindness and attentiveness of the staff. They went out of their way to make us and our daughters—aged 5 and 7—feel comfortable and cared for. It really meant a lot as a traveling family.

On our second night, we initially headed to Taj Bano for dinner, but the experience didn’t go as planned. The atmosphere felt overly formal, and the service was slow and impersonal. After waiting quite a while without being acknowledged, we decided to leave and return to our hotel room instead. Back in the room, we ordered room service. Our daughters wanted burgers, so we ordered two chicken burgers for them. Unfortunately, they didn't enjoy them. My husband and I shared an order of mutton biryani, and we found it flavorful and satisfying.

Overall, it was a good stay. The service stood out, the food was enjoyable, and despite a couple of minor disappointments, we left feeling well taken care of. A solid experience that we’re grateful for.Foodieextreme F — Google reviewLovely experience with the stay . Very cordial and respectful staff , well maintained rooms and a very acceptable  breakfast spread .. a 5 star stay within the budget .
Only minor thing is that the room had a little musty smell while we first entered , plus bathroom ventilation needed an upgrade .Nirmal M — Google reviewThe hotel is easily approachable since it’s on the main highway that runs through Agra. Putting up here since Fri night/ 08 Aug 25. My experience has been nothing less than disappointing. My husband and I have stayed at a number of Taj properties and are members of their Taj Inner Circle so we expect certain standards from the group.

Rooms: Cramped. Comfortable beds as expected. No options of choosing pillows. No bathroom slippers, ironing table, shoe shiners or shoe horn provided in the room. I was in the city for a conference and of course, I needed those items (Interestingly, the hotel could not provide me with a paper bag I needed to take an item along to said conference but was informed they do not have any and I was given a LAUNDRY BAG!).

Guest services: next to nonexistent. Each time I needed anything, I have had to place multiple calls. The response time of the staff is abysmal. Expect to wait at least 30 mins to get sugar or water to your room!

Food: The same dinner menu was repeated twice over a period of three days. The choices are limited and nothing to write home about. The staff is responsive which is possibly the only good thing about the dining experience.

Redeeming feature? The property is pet-friendly and the resident pets Max and Maya make up for the lack of other features. The restriction on larger and heavier pets is what was not expected because we have a pet not featured on their list of breeds not permitted but exceeds the permissible weight who we would’ve brought along.Neikhrie L — Google reviewWe stayed at the Taj while on the trip to Agra . Honestly couldn’t be at the property for more than few hours owing to the busy travel schedule . The service was very personalized and the staff was quite attentive and warm
They went an extra mile to always ensure that the guests had a unique experience

They provided as Packed breakfast with utmost care and attention and even when tk extend of offering a great coffee on our way back to delhi

Its lush surroundings and vintage architecture make it an ideal setting for weddings. The hotel offers luxurious suites adorned with rich colors, antique furnishings, and modern amenities. Guests can enjoy picturesque views of the Taj Mahal from the terrace while savoring traditional Indian, Chinese, and continental cuisine at the on-site restaurant.A really nice hotel, I was a bit skeptical about booking this place as I only tend to go for expensive five star places, but I'm glad I stayed here. It's like an old style haveli with it's own charm.
The place is almost magical, and has a very homely and relaxed feel. It's more for us foreigners /NRIs seeking magical Indian charm, rather than Indians looking for Western ambience, if that makes sense.
The beautiful photos you can see in the hotel's website - our room was a meter or two away from the garden  (and not in some high rise tower up the lift) and one could sit there for hours gazing at the sky.
We were welcomed to the hotel with flower garlands.
Rooms could be locked using old style padlocks, which we found absolutely lovely and gave a nice traditional Indian touch to our experience.
The only negative points I could think of is that this hotel is not in the posh part of Agra and there are not many good eating places within walking distance. Other was that the portion size in the restaurant was a bit too small. E.g. dishes  served with chips had very small portion size of chips compared to what is served in Delhi or UK.
But I would still think this hotel is worth it and is 100% recommended.Priya C — Google reviewThe worst selection of hotel or any property, the management is too rude. We went for our first anniversary celebration. We talk to the incharge/manager of restaurant. He was so into his attitude, not willing to give complete details when asked about candlelight dinner. If I talk about the porter service, they took the luggage, put it in the room, did not even guide us to the way to room. Front desk gave a room number to the portal. Porter took our luggage to the room. We were not even informed about the room number. Housekeeping manager when asked, confirm the room number and guided us to the room. When we were checking out of the room, we called the front desk. We asked for a portal to be sent, mostly porters were roaming around on the floor. No one approached in our room and took the luggage. Then we ourselves carried our luggage to the front desk or you can say reception and there I gave my feedback and the person standing on the reception was saying that he’ll talk to the manager, but I am not sure what kind of management is being done. If this sort of behaviour is being followed, this property will not stand to 2 star even. Please reach out to my number which you have, this is the same email ID which I have used to book the room. Call me. I’ll give you complete details. This sort of behaviour with any guest should not be accepted. If I talk about foreigner guest, they were also not happy. I had word with a few of them when we were in the swimming pool. They were also not happy with the service. If it is a off-season, for you guys, you should still manage the services in the similar or the same way if it is a off-season, that doesn’t mean that the service will be degraded. I got to candlelight dinner, arrange in such a good hotel within Agra. It is also a five category Hotel. The management was so good. They were so helpful. They arranged a perfect dinner for us. According to me, this hotel is the worst selection that anyone could ever make until they are improving there management back. The only good thing I saw in this hotel was the swimming pool. It was quite neat and clean.Ritika J — Google reviewDespite the budget price we rather hoped we wouldn't encounter some of the issues we did. The room was frankly stunning with a good degree of opulence when we walked in. The walls were covered in padded fabric crystal glass light fittings. A private door to the swimming pool and a seating area separate from the bedroom was a great bonus. On arrival the air conditioning didn't work and it took two phone calls and hour apart to get it resolved. The bathroom had no ventilation and very quickly became a rather unpleasant place to be. This is shame as it came with a bath. The air conditioning barely cooled the room to the low 20s. This became a problem as while in the hotel we had upset stomachs and a cool room would have been welcome. We rang reception to ask for a fan but sadly none arrived. The staff were on the whole quite friendly although the bell boy was rather indiscreet in his request of a tip. The staff were friendly and helpful but some of the restaurant staff did struggle with very basic English. Also note that the Agra metro is under construction and the pile driving starts at 5am and finishes at 10pm outside the hotel. The noise may not suit everyone and I would expect this is temporary.Gemunu P — Google reviewTerrible Hospitality – Not Worth the Hype

The hotel property is large and looks good, but the hospitality is absolutely zero. The staff is extremely careless. We booked a deluxe room, and the next day we both ended up with allergies and itching all over our bodies. I complained at the reception, and while we were out, they claimed to change the mattress — but the room was still not cleaned. I insisted on changing the room, and they finally gave us a better one, but by then, our trust was already broken.

The service is extremely slow and disappointing. We waited 45 minutes just for a bottle of water. While we were at the pool, we asked a waiter for the menu — he never came back. That kind of rude and careless behavior is totally unacceptable, especially from a so-called luxury brand.

If you’re coming here expecting a relaxing vacation and good service — forget it. The only good thing is that the place is quiet, but that’s about it. The pool closes ridiculously early at 7:30 PM, which also makes no sense for a vacation spot.

They clearly don’t know how to treat guests, and overall, the hospitality is a complete failure. Not recommended at all.Melina C — Google reviewThe hotel is very large and has many facilities. It has a swimming pool in the center and a beautiful view of the pool. The rooms are quite large and the bathroom and toilet are large and beautiful. The breakfast has a variety of items.For us non-Indians, only cakes and omelettes were acceptable and I expected more from this hotel. Instead, the pool was very good, clean towels were provided and it was a good experience.Parisa S — Google reviewI visited here for one night in december. Not value for money. A bit overpriced for the services offered. The swimming pool was amazing a d is regularly maintained, I visited in Dec so couldn't use.
The rooms will get too chilly and the heaters don't really work. There is no balcony or opening window in deluxe room. The only one big window has a glass pane which doesn't open. The food is average but too costly so is a simple tea. Rather would suggest to eat from any other restaurant as the hotel is very suitably situated on main road.
May rather visit some other property next time I am in AgraVishal S — Google reviewThe Grand imperial Hotel is just a piece of classical relic.The old hotel which boasts of a legacy of 150 years and having hosted guests of  Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and Jayaprakash Narain genre and  conveying further through imminent diginataries and  like A M Maes, Mohamed Reza Pahlavi  and Farha Diba Pahlavi ,the Shah and Empress  of Iran (in 1969)  ,is still continuing as  a valued choice of visiting indian and  foreign tourists alike.

The most stunning feature is the expanse of antique furniture and vintage artefacts still preserved intact and on its array to the guests.

The management puts in commendable endurance  in maintaining and running the property with an element of personal and loving touch which is smoothly transpired into the guests and  touching them.
There's this warm feel of a homecoming and a beckon to an old world ancestral home as you check in.
The food is great and serving is with some love and caress,the staff and attendants are warm and simple and so touching and a classic cut above the pompous and showy laxuries of the five and seven star cult you see elsewhere.

The building is quite old and efforts to restore and maintain amid the beating of the weather and rain is appreciable, though not fool proof.

The garden and landscape and the decor of the hotel is quite expensive and painstaking to maintain,we felt so..

We wish this unique hotel stands tall and bold and let more of valued guests and tourists flow in and be a part of the message the management want to spread. And while doing so you are being a part of the hotels legacy...
We enjoyed two days of stay,very memorable,rooms are cozy comfortable and impeccable.The neatness of the well kempt rooms needs a special mention.

The only little inconveniences are access road due to the metro rail works happening just outside the main gate. The slowness of the connectivity in the far interior rooms despite a wi fi  and poorly connecting mobile networks may bother you if you are too concerned about them. There are civil works and maintenance which may pose inconvenience to some demanding or  fussy guests, otherwise it's a place to call it a perfectly warm home and for more of comebacks...RAFEEK K — Google reviewThey clearly don't value the guests at all. Room service is miserable. We had to call them minimum 3 times to get our order. They don't entertain guest's request. We requested them to change our room because of loud noise from DJ but they refused saying that the hotel is fully booked (in off season)! Who would believe that. When I gave them a written review of their services, they were laughing. Front office staff is unprofessional. Please don't waste your money by visiting this place. Instead pay 1000 Rs more and book your stay with Radisson or similar properties.

We had a lovely stay at Trident Hotel, Agra. The room was compact but perfect for our family of three — and for a family of four, we simply added an extra bed. The food, both at the restaurant and through room service, was consistently delicious and always served on time.

Evenings were a delight with engaging kids’ activities that our children absolutely loved. The pool was definitely the star of the show — right at the center of the resort and full of energy and fun.

The staff was courteous, well-trained, and made us feel completely at ease. The property itself is beautifully maintained and clean throughout.

Overall, we had a fantastic and relaxing family vacation — highly recommended!Sourav P — Google reviewI recently stayed at your hotel in Room 269 on Saturday and unfortunately had one of the most disappointing experiences I’ve ever had at a hotel.

The bed in the room kept sliding apart throughout the night due to unlocked wheels, making it impossible to sleep comfortably.

When I requested an extra bed, I was informed none were available. I had to resort to sleeping on a floor mattress.

At breakfast, I asked for a sunny-side-up egg but was served half an omelet instead.

The waffle I received was burnt.

The mutton Nihari served was of extremely poor quality — quite honestly the worst I’ve ever had.

During breakfast, one of the waiters even pushed my daughter, which was completely unacceptable.

There was no assistance available at the buffet for guests with small children, making the experience even more stressful.

It seemed like there were plenty of staff members present, but unfortunately, the management failed to ensure proper service and hospitality.

I hope you take this feedback seriously and address these issues promptly to prevent future guests from having a similarly poor experience. I would appreciate a response and some form of acknowledgment regarding this matter.Anindya B — Google reviewA Memorable Stay at Trident Agra – Perfect for Families!

Thank you for making our trip so comfortable and memorable. We look forward to visiting again!Kalindi D — Google reviewProbably one of the best stays I’ve had while traveling. Hotel Taj Resorts in Agra truly exceeded my expectations!

I usually go for budget hostels and hotels, but at this point in my trip I decided to book here. Surprisingly, it still fit within my budget, and I never thought I would receive such amazing treatment at this price.

Highlights:
I arrived early, and they kindly offered me an early check-in.
The Taj Mahal is just a short walk away.
All the staff, from reception to security and beyond, were very courteous.
The breakfast selection was excellent.Fredric J — Google reviewTaj East Gate Rd, Forest Colony, Tajganj, Agra, Uttar Pradesh 282001, India•http://www.hoteltajresorts.com/•+91 70601 05001•Tips and more reviews for Hotel Taj Resorts12Grand MercureSave4.3(7660)•5.0(41)•Mentioned on +2 other lists HotelCrystal Sarovar Premiere, Agra is a sophisticated 5-star hotel offering stylish bedrooms, some with views of the Taj Mahal.

The hotel offers a luxurious ambiance with elegant décor, making it a perfect venue for grand celebrations.
The banquet hall was spacious, well-decorated, and managed efficiently. The arrangements for the wedding were well-executed, with beautifully designed seating, lighting, and stage setup. The staff was courteous and attentive, ensuring that guests were comfortable.
The food was a highlight, with a wide variety of delicious dishes catering to different tastes. The outdoor areas and overall setting added to the charm of the event.
Overall, Grand Mercure Agra provided a great experience for a wedding function, offering excellent hospitality, a grand ambiance, and smooth event management.Yogesh P — Google reviewLuckily we were only booked for one night on our trip. We were on floor 3 above reception and a wedding party was in full swing till 2am. We then had lots of noise from guests being noisy and boisterous in the corridor till almost 3am. To top it all, when we got a drink from the fridge, we found the fridge was warm inside and we had no cold drinks. We eventually got to sleep at 4am. Why does the hotel put guests above the reception area if they know there is a noisy party till 2am?Rudi H — Google reviewThe hotel has a huge "wanna be" Vibe, it clearly wants to be in the big league, and the rates are reflective of that ambition, but currently it's just like a budget hotel. Untrained staff, average decor, and worst of all, a terrible chef!
Food is absolutely pathetic. Last night we ordered khichdi for dinner for our baby and made the mistake of saying "please put no chili" as in North India you never know what level of spicy is the considered ok. What we were served is a white mass of rice with small bits of almost raw carrots, forget spices they didn't even add salt. It was inedible and our daughter went to sleep on an empty stomach.
Today lunch we ordered a veg thali which had a hefty price tag of 999 Rs. Told specifically that no chili doesn't mean no spice at all. We were served this dish in the pic, they forgot to add rice, the daal was too salty to eat and had a lair of chili oil on top, the raita had chili powder sprinkled on top. Absolutely no idea why a several star hotel chef would not know how to put a regular amount of salt in a dish!
So, my advice is, don't go by the room rates, they are not justified by the service they offer, it's a budget hotel in all honesty.Swagata B — Google reviewRoom were great n service was good.

The stay was pleasant. The staff was also polite. The restaurant staff was extra caring.Aditya M — Google reviewIt's next to metro station, which also blocks Taj view from lower floors. Everything is it should be for a five star.
Overall Accor chain - you have my attention now.Aniruddha V — Google reviewThis hotel stay was undoubtedly one of the most disappointing experiences of my life. From the moment I stepped into the room, it was evident that the maintenance was severely lacking. The shower in the washroom was non-functional, and even worse, the flush was also not working. On top of that, the basin was clogged, adding to the inconvenience. The air conditioning unit in the room was also faulty, making the overall environment uncomfortable.

To make matters worse, I encountered multiple disturbances during the night with random phone calls, and the front desk failed to provide any satisfactory response or assistance. I can only assume that they have a record of such complaints, which speaks volumes about their service quality.

Although a technician was sent to our room to address the issues, they spent an extended period of time attempting to fix the problems without offering an alternative room. This lack of concern for our comfort added to the overall dissatisfaction of the experience.

In summary, my stay at this hotel can only be described as a truly horrendous and unforgettable ordeal. The multitude of problems with the facilities, combined with the lack of response and appropriate action from the staff, left me deeply disappointed.Javed A — Google reviewHad one night to stay in agra just to visit the taj Mahal and I couldn't have stayed in a better hotel.

It was my Daughter's Birthday so I just casually booked the hotel online as a surprise for her.
I called up the hotel and told them to decorate the room for her.
They decorated the room and even prepared a cake for her.
As we reached the hotel we were greeted with garlands and a welcome ice lolly.
At the reception all the staff wished her a very happy birthday ,
Then as we were going towards our room all the staff on the way wished her and made her feel sooooo special.
I didn't expect that but I was overwhelmed.
We had an awesome stay ,food was very good , pool is huge , children's play area is very good,  the pool tables and bowling alley is well kept.

The room itself was clean and comfortable, and the bed was especially cozy. I appreciated the friendly and helpful staff, who were always available to answer questions.Satheesh R — Google reviewMy recent stay at Jaypee Palace Hotel, Agra was nothing short of extraordinary. From the moment we entered the grand lobby to the moment we reluctantly checked out, every moment was filled with comfort, elegance, and warm hospitality. This is not just a hotel; it’s an experience—a perfect blend of Mughal grandeur, modern amenities, and Indian hospitality at its finest.

Location – 5/5
The hotel is perfectly located in the heart of Agra, just a short drive away from the iconic Taj Mahal, Agra Fort, and other key attractions. Despite being close to the city’s prime spots, the hotel offers an oasis of peace and serenity, away from the hustle and bustle. The convenience of reaching tourist places easily while staying in a luxurious setting is unmatched.

Hospitality – 5/5
One of the highlights of our stay was the exceptional hospitality. The staff at Jaypee Palace went above and beyond to ensure every need was met with a smile. Right from the front desk to housekeeping, and the restaurant staff to concierge services, everyone was courteous, professional, and genuinely caring. We were always greeted with warmth, and they were quick to assist with everything—be it early check-in, tour arrangements, or dietary preferences.

Property and Ambience – 5/5
Spread across acres of beautifully landscaped gardens, the property feels like a regal retreat. The architecture reflects Mughal-style splendor with domes, archways, and fountains, creating a palace-like aura. The lush greenery, walkways, lotus ponds, and open courtyards make the entire hotel feel like a royal estate. Whether you're walking through the gardens at dawn or enjoying a peaceful evening by the pool, the ambiance is serene and uplifting.

Rooms – 5/5
Our room was spacious, well-appointed, and spotlessly clean. The décor was tasteful, blending traditional touches with modern comfort. The bed was extremely comfortable, and the room had all the expected amenities—tea/coffee maker, minibar, high-speed Wi-Fi, and a luxurious bathroom with a tub. The housekeeping was prompt and thorough, ensuring our room remained a pleasant space to unwind.

Dining Experience – 5/5
Jaypee Palace offers multiple dining options, and each one impressed us. The breakfast buffet was lavish with a wide variety of Indian and continental options. The quality of food at Pavilion Café and the Paatra restaurant was outstanding. We especially loved the authentic North Indian thali and the live music in the evenings that added a cultural touch to the dining experience.

Facilities – 5/5
From the large outdoor pool, fitness center, spa, and shopping arcade to the excellent business facilities, everything is thoughtfully designed. Families, couples, and business travelers will all find something to enjoy. The lawns are also ideal for events and weddings, which explains why it's a preferred venue for grand functions.

Final Thoughts
Jaypee Palace Hotel is more than just a place to stay—it’s a destination in itself. With great location, perfect hospitality, and a gorgeous property, it offers a 5-star experience worth every rupee. I highly recommend it to anyone visiting Agra who wants to experience true Indian luxury.Shailendra G — Google reviewWonderful ambience, surrounded by garden, very luxurious well maintained.

Pros:
1. Room was spacious and clean.
2. Rooftop view and vibe is amazing due to Qairo Restaurant.
3. Location is also very convenient from all places.

Cons:
1. Overpriced prices of food items at the restaurant.
2. Slightly overpriced room rent.
3. Lights are very less in the room.
4. Had to call the staff 2-3 times for welcome drink.BHAVESH J — Google reviewI love the stay in this hotel but something which didn't go well with me are as:

1. I found no hygiene in resturant. Mosquitos were flying everywhere and they were on salad and other open food items.
2. No Central AC in common areas and lift. If you want to walk outside your room or use life, in this summer it wouldn't possible here.
3. We all know every hotel charge high for Mini Bar. But by charging 50rs. For a 20rs. Chips packet, they wants GST as well in addition.

But there were few good and noticable things as well:
1. Rooms were very near and clean. All the required amenities, they provided without asking.
2. Food is also good enough.Sumit T — Google reviewHonest Review of Fern Hotel, Agra

I recently stayed at this hotel in Agra during my rally weekend. Since we only need a place to rest for the night and leave early in the morning, we usually opt for good, budget-friendly hotels rather than five-star properties.

The hotel was decent, but the rooms did not meet my expectations. They felt quite casual, and cleanliness was a major concern. The sofa, walls, and even the balcony area had noticeable dirt and cracks, which could definitely be improved. Given that reviews help people make informed choices, I believe hotels should prioritize cleanliness for a better guest experience.

The hotel offers both indoor and outdoor parking, which is convenient. I didn’t try the food, so I can’t comment on that, but I did order tea, which was good. The staff was polite and professional, which I appreciate.

As for the location, it’s in a crowded area but surrounded by many food and shopping options. It’s also not too far from the Taj Mahal, making it a good choice for those looking for an affordable stay without spending the whole day at the hotel.

Overall, I’m giving this hotel 3 stars—not because of any major issue, but because five-star ratings should be reserved for exceptional experiences. I hope the management works on improving cleanliness, as that would make a big difference for future guests.

Would I recommend it? If you’re looking for a budget-friendly stay near the Taj with convenient amenities, this hotel could be an option.Keshavi C — Google reviewThis hotel is situated on a main road and we really love the hospitality shown by the hotel staff.
However, Its still seems to be under renovation.
I didnt see luggage carrier in the hotel and the staff were carrying the luggage on thr shoulders.
Rooms are good but walls need some more renovation. Glass on the window seems to be very dangerous and i wanted my kids to stay away from it cuz it might fall off.
Washrooms are neat and clean and hygiene is maintained.
U will find Bercos, Spa there.
They have a big sized swimming pool. Depth of the swimming starts from 2.5ft to 5.5ft
However it needs to be properly maintained. There were lot of insects, tree leaves in the swimming pool (may be cuz it rained the other day)
Breakfast menu is good but lacks Non veg snacks. I went to the Fern-Alwar and they served us Kebabs and hence i was expecting it from here aswell.
If u put the room key near to ur phn then it will be de-activated and u will have to call the reception to open ur room's door. This happened to me 2-3 times in a single day.
Overall i really had fun and will stay thr if i come to Agra again.Aman — Google reviewWe were here for visit of Taj Mahal. Rooms are noisy,  whole night without any break. Food in restaurant was tasty,  part of our group asked no spicy, but received spicy food.

With its convenient location and excellent hospitality, Grand Mercure Agra is an ideal accommodation option for those visiting Agra.We had a truly wonderful experience at Grand Mercure Agra, and I can’t thank the team enough for their outstanding hospitality. We were traveling with my elderly father and our 1-year-old son, so comfort and care were our top priorities – and the staff exceeded our expectations in every way.

A special thanks to the duty manager, who went above and beyond to ensure we had a smooth and quick check-in around 10:30 AM, understanding our situation and accommodating our early arrival without hesitation. It made a huge difference after a long journey.

Throughout our stay, the sous chef was incredibly kind and attentive during breakfast, lunch, and dinner, consistently checking in on our needs and ensuring we had everything we needed. It was a lovely personal touch that made us feel truly welcomed.

One of the most heartwarming gestures was when our little one got cranky during a meal, and the team offered him a chocolate, which instantly lifted his mood. Small details like this demonstrate how deeply the staff cares about their guests' comfort, especially families with young children.

We also received a small welcome gift, which was such a thoughtful gesture and added a special touch to our experience.

Overall, the stay was memorable not just because of the beautiful property and great location, but because of the genuinely caring and attentive people who work there. Highly recommended for families, couples, or anyone looking for a warm and welcoming stay in Agra.Riyasat A — Google reviewVery luxurious hotel for a great price.

We enjoyed everything it had to offer, although I wouldn't call it a 5 star. It is a solid 4 star property though. The food offered was good and had a twist on most things which was, again, good. But the overall downer was their italian restaurant which, really, was more like why? Just why? They could have done a lot better there.Gaurav A — Google reviewMy recent stay at the Grand Mercure Agra was, on the whole, a very positive experience, especially considering the price point. It's a hotel that offers a lot of value and is a solid choice for travelers looking for a comfortable and budget-friendly option near the city's main attractions.
​The rooms were a definite highlight. They were spacious, clean, and well-maintained, providing a comfortable sanctuary after a long day of sightseeing. The amenities were all in good working order, and the bed was very comfortable, ensuring a restful night's sleep.
​The staff were generally very helpful and friendly. They were always willing to assist with our requests and had a cheerful demeanor. There were a few minor hiccups, however. We had an issue with a room key card that wasn't properly activated upon check-in, requiring a quick trip back to the front desk. These were small, isolated incidents that didn't detract significantly from the overall experience, but they are worth mentioning.
​The morning buffet spread was extensive and well-presented. I did, however, find that the food seemed to be geared more towards international palates. Many of the dishes, particularly the Indian ones, lacked the robust spices and flavors one would expect. While everything was fresh and well-cooked, it felt a little muted for my taste. This is something to keep in mind if you're a traveler who enjoys a more authentic, spicy Indian breakfast.
​Despite these minor points, I would still highly recommend the Grand Mercure Agra. The combination of good rooms, helpful staff, and a very competitive price makes it an excellent choice for anyone visiting Agra. If you're looking for a comfortable and affordable hotel that offers great value for your money, this is a great option.Vipul G — Google review🚨 A Pathetic Experience at Grand Mercure Agra (Accor Group) – A Nightmare Stay! 🚨

Terrible Experience. Wouldn’t recommend Grand Mercure Agra even to my worst enemy.

We planned a peaceful family weekend trip (August 15th-17th) to Agra and, despite several better-priced alternatives, chose Hotel Grand Mercure Agra purely because of its online ratings on MMT & Google and the Accor brand name. Big mistake.

From the very beginning, the stay was marred by utter negligence and a shockingly casual approach towards guests:

1️⃣ Basic Requests Ignored – I had specifically booked a King Size bed, but the hotel conveniently shoved us into a twin-bedded room. Not only uncomfortable for my family (especially my son), but also a sheer disregard for customer preferences. When I asked for an upgrade, I was bluntly told no rooms were available.

2️⃣ Communication Failure at Its Peak – On the second day, I enquired at 8:30 AM with the manager for paid inclusion of lunch & dinner. His response: “I’ll get back to you.”
Well, he never did. By 1:30 PM I had to chase another manager, who gave me the same empty assurance. By then, lunch hours had passed, forcing us to eat outside. In the evening, when the damage was already done, another manager conveniently offered me a “20% discount” for dinner. Too little, too late — and I was already disgusted with their so-called service.

3️⃣ A Horrifying Incident – The final nail in the coffin was when a loud thud in the middle of the night jolted us awake. Shockingly, a portion of the false ceiling near the bathroom collapsed inside the room! Imagine the horror of this happening with a child sleeping inside. Housekeeping did rush in to fix it (kudos to them for promptness), but this blatant negligence on safety is beyond unacceptable.

👉 The biggest issue is not housekeeping, but the hotel leadership’s lackadaisical and indifferent attitude. Managers casually deflecting guest concerns, zero accountability, and absolutely no sense of urgency towards customer experience.Sapraj M — Google reviewHonestly a very good experience; the prices, room and overall services of the hotel are excellent, but what i really liked is their attention to our wishes; they gave us something to fill at the end given our accor member status, and tended to our only "fair" rating as to why it was rated like that. Really good to have the hotel as a break from the very hectic, yet interesting and beautiful city of agra.Pablo — Google reviewFatehabad Rd, Tajganj, Agra, Basai, Uttar Pradesh 282001, India•https://all.accor.com/hotel/C0W7/index.en.shtml•+91 562 711 0711•Tips and more reviews for Grand Mercure AgraI'll never travel to Agra without this trip planner againStart planningLearn moreI will never travel to Agra without this app againAvailable on the App StoreDownload now16The Coral Tree HomestaySave4.6(308)•Mentioned on +1 other list Bed & breakfastThe Coral Tree Homestay is a vibrant and colorful guesthouse with only four rooms, surrounded by lush gardens.

My recent stay at the Ramada Plaza by Wyndham Agra was a pleasant experience overall, offering comfortable accommodations and a convenient location. However, what truly elevated my stay and left a lasting positive impression was the exceptional service provided by one individual: Anil.
From the moment we arrived, Anil stood out as a genuinely friendly and helpful person. He immediately took initiative in assisting us with our luggage, ensuring a smooth and hassle-free check-in process. His warm and welcoming demeanor made us feel instantly at ease.
But Anil's helpfulness didn't stop there. When it was time for us to depart and catch our bus, he went above and beyond what was expected. He not only helped us with our luggage again but also took the initiative to arrange a reliable driver to drop us off at the bus station. This was incredibly helpful and saved us a significant amount of stress and time navigating unfamiliar transportation options.
What impressed me most about Anil was his genuine desire to assist and his proactive approach to ensuring our needs were met. He wasn't just doing his job; he was genuinely invested in making our stay as comfortable and convenient as possible. His friendly nature and willingness to go the extra mile truly made a difference.
While the hotel itself offered comfortable rooms and standard amenities, it was Anil's outstanding service that truly made our experience memorable.

Food was cold and beverages were scarce.
Location: Rasily accessible, on main road. Guards at the gate had a very casual attitude, seemed unhappy and uninterested.
Facilities: On checkin, they provided me 2 suites which were nice but the AC in both of them stopped working after 2 hours. In repeated complaints, they couldn't repair it. No one from the management talked to us. Ultimately they provided us alternative smaller rooms to sleep. This incident spoiled the whole experience and we couldn't sleep adequately that night.
Upkeep of the rooms is poor. Broken electric switches were there.

In March25, I booked this hotel in my name and my wife name through Cleartrip.com, but at first the front manager denied me the booking citing the reason that they don't have the policy to admit local Ids as my wife had the local id. Previously also we booked the hotel with the same Ids but they didn't raised any concern that time. I explained them that we are husband and wife and had our little child with us as well but still they denied to admit us and said to cancel the booking. I said to contact the owner of the hotel but the manager refused to contact him. I then said that I would complaint them to Clear trip, then after all the fight they finally admitted us. But I had to face all this harassment. I would never ever go to this hotel again and would request others as well to check with them before booking as they tend to harass their customers on reaching there.Himanshu K — Google reviewExtremely small rooms with the room door hitting bed on opening and closing in a deluxe double bed room . Two single beds joined to give a double bed  making it very uncomfortable to rest. No place to walk around in room. Highly priced food .No Laundry service provided at hotel.

Pros
1). Very affordable price and good location, close to the Taj Mahal and metro station.
2). Helpful staff which takes care of your needs quickly.
3). Our room had a huge balcony.

Cons
1). The hotel seriously needs renovation. The paint in the lobby, room, bathroom was coming out, the switches and even the furniture needed to be changed.
2). The room was dirty when we reached which was a put off.
3). The TV would not work, the intercom phone also had a problem wen we checked in.

Overall the hotel is good but I think you can get better elsewhere if you pay a bit more money.Hussain S — Google reviewWe booked 2 rooms at the property. First disappointment there was no one to help us with our luggage 🧳 and we carried our luggage by our own. Hotel Manager Mr. Gautam as soon as he saw us coming he ran away towards the restaurant and he kept avoiding us for the full day and we failed to understand this behaviour. Rooms that were given to us were dusty as if no one had stayed in those rooms for a while. The tea kettle was dirty and the floor was dusty. I would appreciate the other hotel staff who served us food and with other amenities. The food dinner was good, but breakfast had very limited options. We never complained about anything because we were aware that Mr. Gautam will not help us. As a regular guest at this property this kinda behaviour was not expected from a manager. Again at the time of exit no one helped us with our luggage 🧳.Prince K — Google reviewQuite possibly the worst hotel we've ever stayed at.

The hotel offers 5-star amenities at competitive prices, with spacious, clean rooms and a well-maintained swimming pool.

There’s a gaming room available at an extra cost, which adds a fun touch, and designated smoking areas are provided (though smoking in rooms is strictly prohibited).

The accommodation was comfortable, clean, and well-maintained, making it a perfect choice for my trip. What really stood out, though, was the exceptional service provided by Suparna. Her warm and friendly behavior made my stay even more enjoyable. She was always attentive, quick to assist with anything I needed, and truly went out of her way to make sure I had a pleasant stay. Highly recommend this hotel for both the great facilities and excellent service!Tushar P — Google reviewSaura Hotel Agra is a Club Mahindra affiliated hotel and I have stayed here before in 2021 when it was the Ramada Hotel and a club mahindra affiliate at that time too.

Talking about the experience this time, I had a few doubts as this happens to be the wedding season in Agra and I have seen wedding guests especially to be rowdy and totally oblivious to other guests’ comforts and accordingly asked a room to be allocated away from the lift and away from the wedding guests’ floor as apparently there was a huge wedding unfolding during the start of my stay.

My worst fears turned true when around 2.30 am this uncivilised group of wedding guests started creating a ruckus in the lobby of the floor, shouting, smoking narcotics or some substance as there was foul smell all over the floor which was very disconcerting if you’re staying with your family and the last thing you want is not being able to sleep because of hooliganism of others.

This is where the Hotel’s response, management and accountability comes in and I am sorry to state that this ruckus continued till about 5 am in the morning despite multiple calls to the hotel’s reception staff. It was only when I called their Manager on her phone early morning (Shraddha Mam was very helpful) and then subsequently warned the hotel’s reception staff that I would be calling the Police that they really stepped on the offending individuals and finally the disturbance subsided eventually after a good 2-3 hours.

During the morning I spoke to their Manager Ms. Shraddha and conveyed my grievances as there was one more day left for this group of buffoons stay in the Hotel and I was in no mood for my rest of the stay’s peace to be snatched away. Till this point I would have given my stay a rating of zero but this is where everything changed when I met Ms. Shraddha in person, she listened to my experience patiently and empathised and acknowledged that the resident hotel staff should have acted swiftly to control the disturbing situation.

She immediately assured me that she will try her best to relocate me to a different floor and in the process she upgraded me to a Suite (I had a suite booking later during my stay) as there was no other studio room available that was not near to the ongoing wedding guests.

My experience with the hotel reached another level from that point onwards as Shraddha Mam was at every step, handling our requests one after the other and finally I was able to sleep the night after once the room was changed.

Talking about other aspects, the gym and swimming pool is pretty handy and functions well for both your swimming and gymming sessions while you’re on a short holiday, both the facilities are not large by any stature of imagination but works well and gets the job done.

Food is fair enough and staff in general is hardworking and attentive to your needs.

The obvious call out is Ms Shraddha for her hospitality and courtesy she extended to us which made our stay from bad to full of joy, hats off to her !

Overall, I would have given a five star rating but the other staff manning the hotel has to learn to prioritise their guests convenience and security over everything else and should proactively take measures to avoid the escalation of issues I mentioned in my ordeal with that cheap wedding guests group who it turned out even stole stuff from Hotel and were later fined for it too :(Aprajit P — Google reviewAs a member this is my first time visit in this hotel.

Visiting the Taj Mahal was nothing short of magical. The moment you step through the gates and catch your first glimpse of the gleaming white marble, it feels like you've entered a dream. The symmetry, the intricate carvings, and the sheer scale of the monument are awe-inspiring.

I went early in the morning to avoid the crowds, and the soft light at sunrise made the whole place glow. It was absolutely worth it. The gardens are beautifully maintained, and the atmosphere is peaceful despite the number of visitors. Inside the mausoleum, the craftsmanship is delicate and respectful, though photography is restricted.

Tip: Wear comfortable shoes, bring water, and consider hiring a guide to truly appreciate the history and symbolism behind this masterpiece.

- No lift option available. So it could be a trouble for elderlies
- Hospitality is good here
- Overall good experience. Nice place to visitMaun S — Google reviewVery very average food. We expected some authentic dishes being such an old restaurant. The Delhi butter chicken was really bad. It tasted only tangy and there were no tint of sweetness in it. The courses were not balanced at all. Starters served with bread/ roti and were limited options to choose from. The main course had small portions but desert was bigger in portion. There were no chicken biryani available to my surprise. The risotto, Falooda, Paneer butter masala, Crab dish, Fish and chips, Mutton rara were just average. I could not identify a dish that I can say I will recommend someone.   Service is good but they did not take any out of menu orders on request. We wanted to have amritsari fish or any fish tikka. But they denied . The did have chicken tikka and other fish dish.  We visited for a late lunch so we might have observed very late service but staffs were cordial. One of the starter came with desert. The chocolate crumbs desert was okay but the Tuile was very bad with taste of old oil.Abhilasha S — Google reviewOne of the best multicuiaine three meal restaurant located in one of the best Hotel of Agra “ ITC Mughal”.

I Visited Taj Bano for a Sunday brunch and the variety was insane to say the least.

Other than regular dishes which are usually in all buffet they had a good variety of Andhra dishes, also quite a few dishes of Millet which is a great initiative under Responsible Eating.

The ambience is very pleasing and inviting. Also the service and hospitality is always been a high point whenever I visit Mughal.

We had a buffet breakfast and dinner here and could barely walk out due to the food coma. Everything was so good that you couldn’t resist the food.Jaya N — Google reviewWhile at ITC Mughal Resort & Spa, most of our meals were at Taj Bano Restaurant, an elegant restaurant with a view of the courtyard offering Indian, Western and Oriental cuisines in contemporary settings with Mughal architecture.

For our first lunch, we chose to sit in the outside area to enjoy the pleasant weather crossing the indoor area of the beautiful restaurant. It was time for zaika of ‘Agra ka swaad’ especially prepared by Chef Kavitha Unni for us. Methi ke Kabab and Matar Makhane ka Shorba were very comforting. Khurmi Paneer was stuffed with cheese and was very unique, Dal Dhungari was slow cooked in whole spices and charcoal which had an amazing flavor. The non-veg variety included Bhuna Gosht which was meat latpat cooked in spices and was simply yum. We also tasted Agre ka Gosht Pulao which was remarkable. For desserts we had a platter with Hot Jalebis with Rabri and Pethe ka Halwa which extended flavours and the taste of Agra. The rich and authentic Agre ka zaika was out of the world.

With ITC Hotels WeAssure initiative there was assurance of safe dining experience. The management is ensuring less or minimal contact between the staff and guests, Savlon hand sanitizer kept on all tables, all the crockery & cutlery are sanitized and prepacked so that there is no touchpoint between 2 people.

Our second lunch was Express Wok which is a proper meal in box known as bento-box which comes in both veg and non veg versions. Let us decode the box for you. The Vegetarian Box had Olive Fried Rice, Asian Spring Rolls (made of rice sheets and glass noodles), Stir fried Asian Greens, Okra Chilli Bean (so unique!) and Date Pancake while the Non-Vegetarian box had Kung Pao Chicken, Governors Chicken, Soy Ginger Fish, Veg Hakka Noodles and Date Pancakes. All the dishes were so yum! We loved the concept of the Bento Box which had everything from starters to main course to desserts.

Dinner was about Awadhi treat where we tried different delicacies like Hara Bhara Kebab, Murgh Kali Mirch Kebab, Subz Zafrani Shorba, Subz Miloni, Jannat-e-Numa, Dal Makhani, Maki Sarson, Gosht Awadhi Biryani and more. For desserts we had Shahi Tukda and Shahed-e-Jam. The meal was rich, authentic and flavourful and we all enjoyed it a lot. The menu was especially curated for us by Chef Ashmit Bhattacharya and Chef Kavitha Unni. A perfect meal and a perfect end!

We also had a chatpata time at the hotel. ITC Mughal ensured we don’t go back without tasting the yummiest Agra ki Chaat. Over the evening they organized a special chaat time and treated us with not just one or two specialities but with 5 yummiest chaats made in house which we relished in the confines of ITC Mughal. From Jalebi Chaat to Pakodi Chaat, Papdi Chaat, Dahi Bhalla Chaat, Motia Makai Chaat…we enjoyed our lip smacking chatpata time with these yummiest chaats.

Breakfast was about Zesty Mornings. At the buffet what was interesting was that there was a glass shield against every food item and no guest was allowed to take the food. Food was being served by servers wearing gloves and mask. The extensive menu included vada, idli, upma, parathas (paneer, matar and aloo) and much more. There was also a live counter where hot Dosas and Uttapams were being made fresh and served with all the 3 chutneys- peanut, tomato, mint & coriander. ITC Hotels have a concept known as ‘Local Love’ under which local dishes from the city is served everyday. We tried Bedmi Puri from the Local Love menu and absolutely enjoyed it.

The array of beverages included fruit juice, milk, coffee, chai etc. We met Chef Philip who specializes in South Indian cuisine. One counter which I always check out while at a breakfast buffet is Omlettes and to my delight there were fresh and live omlettes in the making and were served with a choice of white and brown bread. For desserts, there were muffins in many varieties, waffles, pancakes, cinnamon Danish pastry and many more. We enjoyed our breakfast and the lovely spread of desserts too.ChicLifeByte — Google reviewWe went for dinner at ITC Mughal on 28 November.

I recently visited this restaurant and had a wonderful experience. I ordered paneer and makhani—the paneer was slightly on the sweeter side, but the dal was absolutely fantastic.

This is a difficult place to review as for the amount of money you are paying you can't expect much. So the condition of the rooms is to be expected. 2 star rooms, bumped up to 3 due to the price.
That being said, it was clean, secure and was all you need for one night (which is all you need in Agra).

The service was great. When we asked for alcohol and an ATM they kindly directed us and allowed us to drink in the courtyard with our dinner. Speaking of which, the food was really great and had a lovely atmosphere. The chef came out to speak to us before and after, catering the meal to our spice tolerance.Joe J — Google reviewI had a wonderful stay at this hotel and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Agra. It is  budget friendly, making it a great option for travelers looking for affordability without compromising on quality.

The staff was incredibly polite and accomodating, ensuring a smooth and pleasant experience throughout our stay. The rooms were well maintained and very comfortable, reflecting the hotel's commitment to cleanliness.

One of the biggest advantages of this hotel is its proximity to the Taj Mahal, making it convenient for sightseeing. Despite being an older property, it is very well-maintained and exudes a certain charm that adds to the experience.

Additionally, we checked out a little later than the standard time, and to our surprise, they did not charge us extra, which speaks volumes about their hospitality. The hotel is also remarkably quiet, allowing for a peaceful and relaxing stay.

Overall, this hotel is a fantastic choice for those looking for comfort, affordability, and excellent service. I would definitely stay here again!Sarvottam K — Google reviewThe room is clean. The guesthouse atmosphere is quiet. The staff are happy to help. However arrange your own transport. They arranged my bus to Agra from Delhi and it was double the price of the fare - the bus left 2 hours later than they told me. I felt I was used for commission which is dissopointing. Especially when I was capable of getting my own bus/transport and only accepted help to welcome their offer. Done in good faith. So this in itself would deter me from recommending this place.Victoria S — Google reviewThey asked for money at the end of our stay for food and laundry, didn’t let us pay straight away. Food prices are based on the menu and the laundry was surprisingly 40rs a piece. Usually it’s 300rs per load.
They don’t have it written anywhere at the reception and We ended up paying 1600rs which was almost the price of our whole stay. TerriblePaťo O — Google reviewWe booked the room for two nights and must say our experience was very below the average. Privacy is at risk here as the window above door has transparent glass, washroom window was missing a glass and room was only on first floor, anyone can peek inside, we has to cover the room with a paper. Hotel staff became rude when we refused to have dinner there. We requested to arrange for a transport as we had our train from Tundla Station for which they provided a rickshaw but didn’t share driver’s number with us. Driver charged us 700 but the original charge is 500 and said extra 200 is for the hotel staff. And will leaving also they wanted us to pay them extra tip which was just nonsense.
Only good thing about this place as it is in the city center. Think before you book a room here.Aashish K — Google reviewHaving enjoyed my first stay at Tourist Rest House so much, I was thrilled to return for a second visit—and I’m happy to report that the hotel exceeded my expectations once again.

The room was just as comfortable and well-appointed as before. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and the cleanliness of the entire room was impeccable.

One of the highlights of my stay was the garden area offering a peacful escape. The perfect place to enjoy some peaceful time.

A special mention to Mr. Manish who assisted us to the suite, adding a thoughtful and personalized touch. Wonderful food and Service under the supervision of Chef PRAVEEN who I can say is asset of Taj Hotels. The housekeeping team especially Nikita truly stood out with their attention to detail.

Highly recommend for a perfect Agra getaway.Gorakh D — Google reviewI don’t even know where to begin. Taj Agra turned out to be the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at — hands down. The service was shockingly poor, the hospitality non-existent, and the staff seemed completely indifferent to guest comfort or basic decency.
Every request — whether it was room cleaning, food, or basic amenities — was met with apathy, delay, or just ignored
The staff behaved as though they were doing us a favour by letting us stay there. Politeness? Missing. Efficiency? Non-existent. Basic courtesy? Too much to ask.

It’s genuinely hard to believe a property under the Taj brand could be run this poorly. If you’re looking for a hotel that actually values its guests, do yourself a favour and stay anywhere else.

This was not just disappointing — it was insulting. Never again.Shrishty V — Google review"I had a wonderful stay at your hotel. The room was spotless, the staff were incredibly kind, and the service was top-notch. Thank you for a great experience!"

No help was provided after d slip.The pool Manager just came to pool in between for few min & stood at d pool gazing at is making us uncomfortable when we were inside which was questionable.
Breakfast buffet was okish not great taste as compared in other Taj we stayed a week before which had a yummy and very exquisite buffet breakfast

We had dinner there both evenings and the food accompanied by cold beers  was very  delicious, breakfast not so much.

Location was stand out, with both Taj Mahal gates very close by.

Especially important for us was the warm welcome and huge helpfulnessof the staff, esp. Devang. He guided us on an evening walk to view the Taj from the riverside, was a great story teller, very informative, an easy  conversational style. Devang was very engaging and  friendly, especially kind and gave loads of time and attention with a young boy who was part of the group.

from Maev and EllaKevin G — Google review"Dad you can touch the Taj Mahal!" my son said "Its so near." You could literally touch the Taj Mahal (the most beautiful building in the World) from the roof top terrace. We enjoyed countless breakfasts on the terrace whilst gazing at the gorgeous Taj Mahal.

Stayed in a single room which was very clean, Wifi was good as well.. Only down side was it had a slight humid smell.. (Note: Tuktuk from Agra fort should cost around 100Rs if you directly flag off from the road, max 150Rs. Not knowing the price at the start when I alighted from my bus, I took my first tuktuk for 300Rs)

Staff was helpful when I experienced issues with booking buses for my next trip and offered valuable advice.

Location was the most perfect. It has a cafe with nice rooftop view. Taj Mahal is within walking distance, about 5mins away. I'll suggest to head to there around 6am when the weather is the most cooling and the least crowd, but still a huge crowd though 🙃

(Note: East gate is for online tickets entry, you can easily buy them on the spot which I did, took me 5mins maximum. Just ignore those Tourist guides)See T — Google reviewJoey’s Hostel in Agra was one of the highlights of our trip!

Thank you Keke for inviting us to your home and connecting us with your family, it was a pleasure..🙏Artem R — Google reviewThe room was amazing, the only issue that I had was that the stairways (in the common areas) the door frames, and the lounge area under the bed loft were all very short and it was very easy to hit your head on if you are tall (I am only 5 foot 11).

When my partner arrived at 01:00 AM in the morning, the staff followed her to our room and hassled her to provide her visa and passport right away, despite us asking for some personal space for at least 10 minutes to reconnect after not seeing each other for several months. They were very rude and disrespectful and would not leave until they were asked more sternly.

The location is good, the rooftop has a clear view of the Taj Mahal, however the rooms are not in the same building as the reception which requires a walk out onto the street and down an alleyway.Toby L — Google reviewStayed with family in their Taj view room.

Our stay at Taj Villa Agra was a nightmare from start to finish. The bedsheets and pillowcases were filthy, and the entire place was overrun with mosquitoes, making it impossible to sleep comfortably.

Despite having paid for breakfast, the staff refused to serve us eggs, which was highly unprofessional and disappointing. To make matters worse, the hotel staff were often found lounging on the staircase, glued to their phones, instead of attending to guests.

just minutes away from east gate of Taj Mahal, tucked away of the busy street and next to many wonderful little shops.
On the Roof top there is a restaurant and a Grand view of the Taj Mahal worth the visit even if you are not staying there.
Great sunset spot
amazing and helpful staff!

The Mushroom cheese curry is a must! Very kind and friendly staff.Mateus R — Google reviewA budget-friendly stay with a great view of the Taj Mahal from the rooftop. Rooms are clean, staff is polite, and the location is very convenient for tourists. Good value for money!Prasant W — Google reviewWe stayed here for three nights and had a great experience. The room was clean and equipped with all the essentials—towels, soap, and toilet paper.

It's a budget-friendly option, especially for travelers like me, and the staff were incredibly helpful throughout our stay.

I also recommend trying the on-site restaurant. The thali was delicious, and the view of the Taj Mahal made it even more special.Michele D — Google reviewIt is close to Taj Mahal, this is the only good thing I can say.

From a negative side:
There is no hot water, only a boiler to heat it up, and there is only one for the entire hotel, so you need to ask for hot water.
One window into a staircase of the hotel itself. No external windows.
There is no sound isolation; you hear all the talks at the reception and every guest passing by the reception.
Ants are running all over the floor.
No heater in the room, quite cold during the nights.
Weird questions were asked at the reception, and they charged me more than what was stated on Booking.comstating there were fees they forgot to mention.
Ancient squicky bed, you would be afraid that it brakes when you turn to the other side.Alexey V — Google reviewJust a walk away from the Taj Mahal. A budget friendly hotel with cordial staff. The location is very unique as the Taj Mahal is 2 minutes walk away.Sukanta M — Google reviewI only spent one night here, but the place is lovely. The room was clean and comfortable and quite spacious too. The staff at the front desk were exceptionally helpful. The location is also great, about 4 minute walk to the East Gate of the Taj Mahal, and near to many cafes and restaurants. I'd definitely stay here again.Paige S — Google reviewGreat location very near the Taj.  Owner is nice and friendly.
Typical Indian budget hotel, reasonably clean not great.  If it were not for the Taj no one would ever visit this neighborhood.

I can't recommend any other hotel better than Hotel Marygold in Agra and Taj Mahal is just on walking distance and they have a great parking.
Roof tap view Taj Mahal is verry awesomeKrishn S — Google reviewIt was the most horrific experience. Zero cleanliness, zero professionalism, zero quality. They even do not have any space for keeping bed linen, pillows and towels. Hence dumped all of them in a corner of the corridors. They never cleaned the kettles they provided to their guests. I booked but changed the hotel immediately without even caring about my money and looked for another hotel. The whole hotel was stinking as hell. I wouldn't recommend this hotel even to my enemies.Manikanta C — Google reviewTerrible and Unprofessional Service

This was one of the worst hotel experiences I’ve ever had. I booked and paid for my room via Booking.com more than two months in advance. However, when I arrived, I was told there were no rooms available. They tried to move me to another hotel, but the room they offered was completely different from what I had originally booked.

The staff were extremely unprofessional and rude. They didn’t even try to explain the situation properly. Instead, they laughed and joked around, completely ignoring the fact that I was standing there frustrated. It felt like they had no respect or concern for their guests.

What made this worse was that I only had one day in Agra, and instead of enjoying my time visiting the city, I had to waste hours finding a new hotel due to their incompetence.

If you’re looking for a stress-free trip, avoid this hotel at all costs. It’s poorly managed and offers no sense of professionalism or responsibility toward their guests. This was a complete disappointment, and I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.HOF — Google reviewMy recent stay at this hotel was incredibly disappointing. The service was very poor, with staff showing little concern for guest comfort or requests. The rooms were dirty, poorly maintained, and felt suffocating. To make matters worse, the air conditioning did not work, and despite informing the staff twice, no one bothered to come and fix it.
Adding to the misery, there was a late-night drinks party with loud music, making it nearly impossible to rest. The hotel did nothing to manage the noise, leaving us frustrated and exhausted.
Overall, I would not recommend this hotel for even a single night—especially for familiesRishi G — Google reviewVery Bad Experience

This was a terrible experience. I booked the hotel through Booking.com, but when I arrived, they told me there were no rooms available and tried to move me to another hotel. The new room was nothing like what I originally booked.

The staff were unprofessional and rude. They were laughing and chatting among themselves without caring that I was there. It felt like kids were running the place.

This is the worst hotel I’ve ever stayed at since using booking apps. I don’t recommend this place to anyone.T2N — Google reviewIt's was a wonderful experience in Hotel martGold, Agra.

They charge so much but didn’t even provide a complimentary water bottle. We reached at 11 PM and asked for food, but their restaurant was closed. Ordered from outside and asked for spoons and plates, but they refused, saying the restaurant was closed. The room was filthy with tobacco spit everywhere, and the washroom was equally dirty. The tap wasn’t working, and they claimed hot water was available, but there was no geyser in the room. Later, they said hot water is only available at 6 AM.

Known as the crown jewel of the hotel, it offers a family-style meal with an assortment of kebabs and tikkas cooked in clay tandoors. The restaurant's signature dish, Dal Bukhara, is highly recommended. With experienced chefs specializing in North-West Frontier cuisine, Peshawri promises highly-flavored delicacies.Peshawri lives up to the Bukhara hype with excellent vegetarian food. Their daal bukhara and paneer khurchan are to die for and their fresh tandoori breads with their chefs behind the tandoor are incredible.

The cherry on the cake, literally, were the desserts - amazing phirni, kulfi and gulab jamun.

Mobin, Sunil, Krishna and Udayveer especially ensured we had an incredible experience.Aditya S — Google reviewHad a magical time eating at this amazing restaurant!!!! The chef and kitchen are apart of the experience so you can really feel immersed in the India 🇮🇳 culture.

You eat with your fingers so be prepared.

The food has a lot of flavor so prep for that too. This is more traditional Indian cuisine and I very much like the setup and vibe.

Because the kitchen is visually part of the restaurant you can taste the smells and smoke from the fine dining.

Drink menu is quite robust considering it’s a traditional Indian cuisine.

I’d recommend gong with the Gold or Platinum menu options.Andy M — Google reviewThe food was extremely flavourful and yummy and the service was so good, prices are on the expensive side. The dal bhukara was extremely tasty. Even the rasmalai was softChaya B — Google reviewPeshawri at ITC Mughal offers the finest Mughlai cuisine I've ever experienced. It's a sophisticated dining establishment featuring live tandoor counters, and its ambiance draws inspiration from Mughal architecture. The staff, notably Mr. Udayveer Singh, is prompt and amiable, offering helpful recommendations. I indulged in Paneer Tikka, Dal Bukhara, and Murg Makhani, all of which were exceptionally tender and flavorful. Accompanied by Tandoori Naan and Pudina Laccha Paratha, generously adorned with fresh butter, each dish showcased exquisite quality and distinct flavors. I highly recommend this restaurant to any Mughlai food enthusiast, especially given the option to customize spice levels with the chef. Overall, my dining experience was exceptional.Mridula B — Google reviewDisappointed. The menu is limited (which is understandable given the focus) but the food is really quite poor by Indian standards.

We've spent two weeks travelling across the country and this rated as probably the worst meal we've had and was by far the most expensive. If you're going to charge over INR 3000 (three thousand) for a single kebab, it should be exceptional. We got four small lumps of meat, significantly overcooked with an uninteresting rub.

We've stayed in various places during our visit, including far more salubrious hotels and the food has been better quality, more varied, more filling and much cheaper. A real letdown given that this restaurant has been widely recommended to us by locals.Adam B — Google reviewWhoever has dined in at the renowned Bukhara at ITC Maurya in Delhi would not need any introduction to Peshawri. Peshawari has exactly the same concept as Bukhara- from the cuisine to interiors. Peshawri showcases the food resembling the traditional style of the Indian North-West Frontier region where clay ovens or tandoors were used. Everything in Peshawri is made in house and the thaumaturgy associated with it is simple: high-quality and locally-sourced ingredients to encompass only the finest.

A unique thing about Peshawri is that they don’t give you cutlery and encourage you to eat with hand but to ensure your dress doesn’t get dirty they give you an apron.

To keep COVID-19 away, all precautions were taken care of under their #WeAssure programme. From sanitisation of the couch and table to sanitisation of crockery and cutlery which is then wrapped in the WeAssure assurance. Servers were seen wearing mask and shield and dishes were being served on wooden planks to avoid any contact. Digital menu replaced laminated tree menus and wooden tongs were used instead of other tongs.

We tried the iconic Naan Bukhara- a 4 ft huge which is actually bigger than a baby blanket and was so soft, velvety and yummy. Yes, Naan Bukhara is so large that it is often called a baby blanket.

It was a delight being served by the senior most Chef Surat Singh who is the star chef in the buzzing kitchen of ITC Mughal and Chef Kavitha Unni. People across the world know the aura of Dal Bukhara and a true Delhiite like me is no alien to it. We witnessed Dal Bukhara in the making while it was being cooked on charcoal for 24 hours for the authentic taste, consistency and flavour. Other dishes we had included Paneer Tikka, Tandoori Aloo, Bharwan Aloo, Reshmi Kebabs, Mutton Burra and Murgh Makhani. In desserts, we tried sweet dishes like Phirni which was served in a mitti bartan, Gulab Jamun and Rasmalai.

It was a heavenly treat altogether. The incredible experience, talking to the chef and seeing the dishes being made live which added more to the satiety value. The feel of the place was earthy and old. It was fully packed with people of all ages – young as well as old. It was a great experience altogether to dine in Peshawri, the most exquisite restaurant at ITC Mughal. We truly relished the robust flavors of the North-West frontier made in clay ovens or tandoors with simple, high-quality and locally-sourced ingredients.  The restaurant’s real skill lies in its deceptively lean composition. Instead of the heavy oil and butter base you’d expect from kebabs, Peshawri’s cooking is all light-touch, the selection of kebabs is not accompanied by any sauce or gravy, but only pre-marinated and cooked before serving.ChicLifeByte — Google review(WORST PART IN MIDDLE) We went to Peshwari earlier tonight and it was horrible, especially at a place of this level. A fly flew into my food, and immediately I told the server. The server just took it away, no sorry no nothing, and came back with another bowl of the dal after we already said we were full. They didn’t even take it off the bill. I came here ready to pay the price since I thought the food would be sanitary, and mistakes do happen but a fly in someone’s food is not acceptable and at the very least should warrant an apology and a discount.

Then the bill came, and I paid in 500 rupee notes since I had too many of them. The bills they gave the change in were ripped and taped up. They gave us UNUSABLE BILLS. Why they would even have that in their restaurant is beyond me, but they shouldn’t be giving that to paying customers.

I was told ITC is a top notch hotel, but I’ve had better experiences at Taco Bell when my food has came out wrong. Contrary to this, the Taj was giving me extra rotis and desserts when I mentioned how good the food was. They know how to do hospitality compared to the useless people of ITC.Mihir ( — Google reviewI came here because one friend recommended it to me. The place is amazing. I asked for the Dal and it was the best one that I’ve ever tried. You should also have to order the butter Naan; it’s also one of the best. The service is very polite; they want to take care of you so that you can enjoy the meal. It’s a place where you eat with the hands, so that the food tastes better. Eating here is not really cheap comparing with the most Indian restaurants, but one in a while it’s good to have a whim.Gloria V — Google reviewTajganj, Agra, Uttar Pradesh 282001, India•https://www.itchotels.in/hotels/agra/itcmughal/dining/peshawri.h…•+91 562 402 1700•Tips and more reviews for PESHAWRI47SikandraSaveMentioned on 1 list Sikandra, a residential area, is famous for the tombs of Mughal Emperor Akbar and his wife, Mariam.
