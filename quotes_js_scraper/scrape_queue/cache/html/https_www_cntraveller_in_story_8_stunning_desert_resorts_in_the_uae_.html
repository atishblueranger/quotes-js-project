From private pool villas and nature reserves to Hollywood film sets and hedonistic escapes, here are eight of the best places for a desert stay.Al Maha Dubai is named after the Arabian Oryx
Al MahaAl Maha, DubaiTranslating as “the oryx”, Al Maha is named after the UAE's national animal – and dozens of them roam freely on the resort's grounds, unafraid to come and say hello. They are joined by camels and bold gazelles, which often wander up to tented villas to sip from the private infinity pools. Located an hour outside of Dubai, in the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve, the romantic eco-resort is a modern take on Bedouin living, with stand-alone tented villas interspaced between rolling sands. The main resort area is home to all-day dining restaurant Al Diwaan, while the Timeless Spa offers signature treatments that draw on Middle East and Southeast Asian aromatherapy traditions. Activities range from archery and nature walks to falconry and camel trekking.plan a stayBab Al Shams is Dubai's original desert resort
Bab Al ShamsBab Al Shams, DubaiBab Al Sham, Dubai’s longest-running desert resort, recently reopened with a new lease of life as part of Kerzner International’s Rare Finds collection. The original resort launched in 2004 as quarters for Dubai’s equestrian set and bustled with the clamour of a working stable. Today, the serenity of the desert blends with all the modern trappings of a luxury resort. There are 115 guest rooms and suites housed across two 16-storey buildings, with subtle Moorish nods and tropical gardens that transport guests to a different time and place – although the oasis-like infinity pool and swim-up bar are decidedly Dubai. The resort’s original Middle Eastern restaurant Al Hadheerah has been spruced up with a new menu, while new all-day dining restaurant Zala dishes up plates inspired by Ottoman and Greek cuisine. There’s also plenty to keep children entertained with belly dancers, musicians, falconers and a caravan of pet camels waiting in the wings.plan a stayTerra Solis is an escape in the Dubai desert
Terra SolisTerra Solis, DubaiDubai’s newest glamping experience Terra Solis is helmed by the same people behind the world-famous electronic dance festival Tomorrowland, arriving in Dubai South’s sandscapes in 2022 with a string of high-profile DJs in tow. Terra Solis Dubai brings poolside beats and day-to-night parties, set amid 37 hectares of secluded dunes. The upscale resort features 48 opulent tents, 20 lodges and six poolside cabins. Music fans should keep an eye on the lively events calendar, while gourmands can indulge in a sharing platter from its restaurant Mesa, inspired by Tomorrowland’s “Tastes of the World” cuisine.plan a stayAl Wathba Desert Resort and Spa
Al WathbaAl Wathba, A Luxury Collection Desert Resort & Spa, Abu DhabiRising from the desert like a mirage, Al Wathba reflects traditional Bedouin villages of yesteryear, though slick facilities catapult it seamlessly into the 21st century. Just 45 minutes outside of Abu Dhabi and close to Al Wathba Wetland Reserve, the desert resort sprawls across two hectares and is split across 13 villas with private pools and more than 90 rooms. Guests have the chance to learn more about UAE heritage through falconry and camel racing experiences, before relaxing in the resort’s Saray Spa. Extending over 2,200 square metres and featuring 11 treatment rooms, hammams, salt rooms and snow caves, the focus here is firmly on wellness through a combination of nature, tradition and tranquillity.plan a stayQasr Al Sarab has featured in several Hollywood blockbusters
Qasr Al SarabQasr Al Sarab Desert Resort by Anantara, Abu DhabiWhen a resort is commissioned by the royal family, you know service will be fit for a king (or queen). Constructed in just 650 days by order of the UAE’s rulers, the kingdom-like fortress emerged from the Rub Al Khali desert in 2007 as a grand smorgasbord of Bedouin heritage and Emirati opulence. With 207 rooms, suites and pool villas, Qasr Al Sarab becomes increasingly beautiful as the sun begins to set. Movie fans may recognise the vistas from Star Wars: The Force Awakens, while the cast of Oscar-winning dystopian sci-fi hit Dune also stayed here while filming nearby. The drive from Abu Dhabi takes about two hours, although the scenery en route is beautiful, and a trip to the resort’s plush spa is the perfect way to unwind on arrival.plan a stayTelal Resort Al Ain is in the Remah Desert
Telal Resort Al AiTelal Resort Al Ain, Abu DhabiTelal Resort rolls back the sands of time with uninterrupted views of deep caramel dunes stretching for miles. Tucked within the peaks of Remah Desert, the boutique hotel is set on the former stomping grounds of nomadic Bedouin tribes and has a rich history that can be explored through the hotel’s heritage and culture packages. The property has kept its traditional charm, with elaborately carved furniture, authentic woven fabrics and Arabesque artworks sitting side by side with extravagant private pools, Jacuzzis and saunas. An 80-minute drive from Abu Dhabi International Airport, the hotel offers uninterrupted vistas of a natural conservation area and glimpses of wild desert animals are not uncommon, though distractions emerge in the form of zip-lines, quadbikes, sand zorbing and archery.plan a stayA private pool villa at the Ritz-Carlton Ras Al Khaimah, Al Wadi Desert

Mysk Al FayaMysk Al Faya Retreat, SharjahIn the 1960s, a British-style petrol station, health clinic and supermarket were built on an empty road in a desolate corner of Sharjah. The single-storey concrete blocks were eventually abandoned, destined to fall into ruin – until the Sharjah government stepped in. Design firm Anarchitect transformed the plot into the five-bedroom Mysk Al Faya Retreat, incorporating the original buildings into the final design. A spa, pool and terrace restaurant were added to the plot, along with a unique hands-free spa featuring a herbal room, salt pool and tropical shower walk. Today, the secluded resort bears no resemblance to its humble beginnings, aside from a lone BP pump in the forecourt. The surrounding Mleiha desert, meanwhile, was found to hold some of the region’s most important archaeological discoveries, including Bronze Age tombs, and was recently nominated for UNESCO Word Heritage status.plan a stayFirst published on CNT Middle EastAll products are independently selected by our editors.
