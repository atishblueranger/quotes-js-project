 This beach surely tops the list of the most visited beaches near Kolkata. Lying at a distance of 183 km from Kolkata, Digha is known for its huge waves and roaring thunders. The natural beauty of this place with its swaying casuarinas and palm trees make for some breathtaking views. Countless stalls line the beach selling exotic curios made from sea shells and other such stuff. The sea town is divided into two parts namely: Old Digha and New Digha. Since a part of the beach in Old Digha has got submerged into the ocean, the Government has extended the beach a little further about 2 km away that comprises the New Digha area. Unlike Old Digha, New Digha is more conducive to swimming so you could get into those swimming trunks and take a plunge here.
