7 Best Places For Trekking Near Shimla
To get you started, here’s everything you need to know about the 7 best treks that originate out of Shimla and will ensure you have a great travel experience!

Speaking of the road less taken, the trek to Karol Tibba is not often mentioned in the list of day hikes from Shimla.

Karol Tibba temple falls within the Shivalik range of Himalayas and is the tallest peak within the Solan district.

2. Shali Tibba Trek


If you’ve ever been to Shimla, you have probably already seen the lonely Shali Tibba peak looming over the Mashobra Bridge. The peak is not the tallest but still offers 360-degree views of Shimla, Mashobra, Kufri, Fagu, and Narkanda. The summit houses the temple of locally revered Goddess Bhima Kali, which is accessible by a well-maintained trail that was constructed by the King of Faridkot back in 1936.
The trail goes through a beautiful valley of blue pine and cedar forest, and makes for the perfect one-day hike from Shimla, making it one of the best places for trekking near Shimla. While it is true that the hike can be done in a single day, it is recommended to set up camp near the village of Khatnol. To reach Khatnol, you must first travel to Mashobra from Shimla. From Mahsobra, start a steep descent to the village of Sipi. Continue your descent until you reach the Noble Gad river. There is no bridge over the river, so it must be forded.
Altitude: around 240 metersDistance: 7 kilometersDifficulty Level: Easy

3. Hatu Peak Trek


At a distance of 70 kilometers from the city of Shimla, Narkanda is the starting point for the Hatu Peak hike. While the hike is not a difficult or a long one, the summit is the highest peak within the Shimla district of Himachal Pradesh. The trail is surrounded by some fantastic views of the Himalayas while being covered in a mixed forest of Deodar, Fir, Spruce, Cedar, and Blue Pine. The summit is home to Hatu Mata temple, a shrine dedicated to Mandodari, the wife of King Ravana. The folklore also says that the peak was once home to the Pandavas during their Agyaat Vaas.
To reach Hatu Peak, take the local bus on the Shimla-Rampur route. The journey will last about 2-3 hours and will cost no more than 60-70 bucks. If you are travelling by a cab or a private vehicle, you can find well-maintained parking lots at the starting point of the hike. The best time to undertake the Hatu Peak hike is during the first few weeks of March as you’ll get to walk on fresh snow during that time.

4. Tara Devi Trek


The hike to Tara Devi temple, while being a short and easy one, is one of the most recommended hikes when it comes to mountain trekking around Shimla. While the temple is accessible by road, the hike is highly recommended and can be undertaken by travellers of all fitness levels and age groups.
To really amplify the fun of your Tara Devi temple experience, you can board the famous Shimla Toy Train to reach the hike starting point. The trail is a narrow and steep one, which especially the adventurists may find exciting.
The summit houses the Tara Devi temple and offers panoramic views of Kasauli, Chail, and Shimla. The trail itself is covered with pristine green meadows rich with local flora. For history enthusiasts, it may be worth noting that the temple was constructed approximately 250 years ago and initially had a wooden statue of the deity, which was later replaced by a more attractive idol constructed with some eight precious elements.It is recommended to rent a hiking stick to help you make the ascend if you are not used to steep trails.

5. Summer Hill Trek


The sheer natural beauty of Summer Hill is not exactly a “path less taken” makes it a must-visit for anyone present in Shimla. The starting point of the short hike is accessible by both road and the toy train. From the Summer Hill railway station, you can start your hike (or walk) surrounded by pristine beauty of nature. The hill is part of a seven-hill cluster, all of which can be explored on foot. The pine and deodar laden hills offer great panoramic views of the surrounding hills.
While the hills are dotted with some beautiful estates, the most noteworthy building is the Indian Institute Of Advanced Study. The Himachal Pradesh university college is housed within a former Visceral Lodge which was built in 1888.

6. Churdhar Trek


The highest peak in the lower-himalayan region, Churdhar is perhaps the most well known trek near Shimla. In order to undertake the trek, you will need to travel to the village of Nohradhar, which is a 5-hour drive from Shimla. With that said, the views and the thrill that follows, will be well worth the long drive. The 23 kilometre trek is blanketed by lush green forests, rocky trails, and divine views of the Himalayas, is not exactly a beginner-friendly affair. In fact, when it comes to mountain trekking near Shimla, Churdhar is perhaps one of the most challenging treks.
The peak offers 360-degree views of the surrounding ranges and on a clear day, you can catch a glimpse of the famous Himalayan ranges such as Kinner Kailash. The peak also boasts a towering statue of Lord Shiva, and is highly revered among the locals. At the very least, sturdy trekking shoes are highly recommended.
Finally, it is worth noting that the trail from Nohradhar only has a few shops on the way. For this reason, it is recommended to carry the basic necessities with you at all times. These include, but aren’t limited to water-bottles, snacks, and energy drinks.
Altitude: around 3660 metersDistance: 32 kilometersDifficulty Level: Hard

7. Kuppar Bugyal Trek


The hike to Kuppar Bugyal is one of the least-known trails in the region. Falling in the Pabbar Valley, the south-east corner of Himachal Pradesh, the hike to Kuppar Bugyal starts from Kharapathar. Kharapathar is a 70-kilometer, extremely pleasant drive from Shimla. After reaching Kharapathar, the first stop is at Giri-Ganga temple, which is where the Giri-Ganga originates.
For this reason, it is advisable to start your hike from Kharapathar itself. Shaded by deodar trees, the trail makes for a long but pleasant walk, as opposed to a short but extremely stressful drive.
At the end of the trail, you will come across the Giri-Ganga temple. Surrounded by interesting folklore, the Giri-Ganga is said to have originated when a pilgrim returning from Rishikesh toppled his tumbler of Ganga-water (Gangajal). From Giri-Ganga temple, reaching Kuppar is a matter of 3-4 hours of relentless hiking. The trail is a well-defined one and is frequented by local shepherds, so you don’t have to worry about getting lost in the woods.
Since Kuppar Bugyal is not a well-known hiking trail, it is advisable to carry supplies such as tents, food, snacks, and plenty of water to avoid any sort of mishaps.
