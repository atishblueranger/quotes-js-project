 1. Chadar Trek 





3.2
 /5



 The Chadar Trek or The Frozen River Expedition is one of the most unique and challenging treks in India. The 6 day chadar trek across the frozen Zanskar River in Ladakh takes place during the latter part of January till end of February or sometimes even in the first week of March, depending on the weather. The starting point of your chadar Trek for the Base Camp is Chilling. Drive along the Leh-Srinagar Highway to reach Zanskar, a little ahead of Zanskar lies Chilling. The end of Chilling road is where the Chadar trek starts. Take small steps on the Chadar to get a feel of the ice beneath.Total Duration: 6 DaysTotal Altitude: 11,400 ftBest Time to Visit: January - February 








 2. Stok Kangri Trek 






 Located at Hemis National Park, Ladakh, Stok Kangri is 20,190 ft high above sea level. This also makes it the highest mountain in the Stok Range of the Himalayas, giving a magnificent view of Zanskar and Indus Valley. Trekkers are attracted here as it presents new landscapes and ultimate scenery in calm surroundings. Even though the trek is relatively easy, given the altitude of Ladakh, air becomes thinner resulting lack of oxygen. Due to this, trekkers may suffer from altitude sickness, nausea and headaches, which makes Stok Kangri quite challenging for mountaineers. Total Duration: 8 DaysTotal Altitude: 20,190 ftBest Time to Visit: Mid June - September 









 3. Pin Parvati Pass, Kasol 





4.5
 /5




 Pin Parvati Pass serves as a perfect destination for the trekkers seeking challenging adventure. It is one of an amazing Trans Himalayan trek that will not only leave spellbound by its beauty but also gushing with adrenaline with the challenges it throws at you. With a fascinating trail of approximately 110 km, the thrill it presents is almost unending. The Pin Parvati Pass Trekking trail is not really well defined but get worse during the monsoon season. The track within the thick forests of Great Himalayan National Park is also a big challenge even for an experienced trekker. Crossing the Parvati River and its various tributaries can be a bit excruciating and so does traversing the high altitude fissures. However, no matter what number of challenges it presents, the Pin Parvati Pass trek is exhilarating enough to make it one of the most sought after Himalayan Pass trek at high altitudes.Total Duration: 11 DaysTotal Altitude: 17,450 ftBest Time to Visit: July - September
