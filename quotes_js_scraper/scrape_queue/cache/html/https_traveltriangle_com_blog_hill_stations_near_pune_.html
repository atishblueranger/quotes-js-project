Frequently Asked Questions About Hill Stations Near Pune


What is the condition of roads in these hill stations?


						Being hill stations, the roads are certainly not smooth enough to travel smoothly, but not majorly worse. Certain hilly terrains are not located at a high elevation and are thus not very steep. Nowadays, the authorities have become quite concerned regarding it, and are thus maintaining them quite well. You will frequently not come across many broken roads as of previous.                    





Do I need to carry any legal documents for my trip to these hill stations?


						If you are someone coming from a place located outside India, then carrying legal documents like passports, visas, and identity proofs are a must. Moreover, many hotels and amusement places have different charges for the NRIs, which may pose to be a problem later. For the Indians, it is always safe to carry an identity proof along with you because inquiries can be made, and you cannot let it affect the experience of your trip.                    





What is the budget to visit a hill station near Pune?


						As Pune is located within the country of India, it is not a high-cost affair for the people living in India, as there are several cheaper modes of transportation available. However, people coming from abroad need to spend a good deal of money on flight tickets and hotel costs. However, if you happen to book early, during the off-season, you may get some discounts.                    





What type of foods are common in these hill stations?


						Usually, steamed foods are commonly found in the hill stations, due to their high altitude and elevation. Thus, you will get ample momos, thukpa, noodles to relish on. Apart from that, each place has some special local delicacies to serve, which is something worth exploring.                    





What type of clothes should I pack?


						Hill stations near Pune hardly records the lowest temperatures near 15°C due to the coastal proximity. Even if the temperatures are low, it is not the lowest in these destinations. So, it is better to carry regular clothes at full length to fight the chilly breeze, sometimes. Other than that, as the Sun remains whole in the daytime, it is better to explore the places in some light-weight clothes.                    





Do I need to hire a tour guide for sightseeing?


						If you are an avid traveler or a couple, then you would hardly want to hire a tour guide who would interrupt your privacy and freedom. But, if you are a group of travelers, family, or friends, then you can go for a tour guide, to know more about the place, and get the best out of it.                    





Which are some of the nearest hill stations to Pune?


						Lonavala, Panchgani, Matheran, Khandala, and Bhandardara are some of the nearest hill stations to Pune. So, if a weekend getaway is on your mind from Pune, then do not think twice before planning a short trip to these scenic destinations.                    





Which are some of the best hill stations to head during summers?


						Lavasa, Khandala, Lonavala, Mahabaleshwar, and Matheran are the best hill stations to visit during the pleasant summer vacation. Due to the location in the coastal region, these places do not experience humid summers, thus making the Sun quite friendly.
