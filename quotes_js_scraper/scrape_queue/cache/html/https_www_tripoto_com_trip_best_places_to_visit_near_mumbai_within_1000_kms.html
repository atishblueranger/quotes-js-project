The place happens to be a Union Territory of India and is the capital of the Dadra and Nagar Haveli. It was once called Vila de Paco d’Arcos when the Portuguese made their presence felt in the country. It was once a small village but now is filled with industries and is a town of its own. If you decide to visit the place, the Roman Catholic Church just off the Silvassa bus stand is a great monument to visit. Its museum, the Madhuban dam and Balaji Temple are great tourist attractions. Apart from that, the Dadra park,Ban Ganga Lake and Vrindaban temple offer great sightseeing options. One must sample the cuisine here that has held on to its Portuguese influence. It is an honour for us to include this place on my list of places near Mumbai within 200 km. This place serves its purpose of being one of the top spots on this list of weekend getaways from Mumbai. Adorned with Portuguese architecture, the Catholic Church is a standing testimony of their work. Formerly known as Vile de Paco d’Acros, this place now stands as a Union Territory of India and is the capital for Dadra and Nagar Haveli. You can visit the Dadra park, the Balaji temple and many more tourist spots here. So it would be wise to take a short trip to this place, gorge on Portuguese cuisine and relax all day long.<b></b></p><p data-spotid="392086"><b>Distance from Mumbai - 173 Kms</b></p><p data-spotid="392086"><b>How to get there: </b>The nearest airport is at Diu seven km away.

Ideal for unplanned getaways, Malvan has a long list of facilities to charm you with. First off, there’s scuba diving, which might come as a surprise to many. 600 kms away from Mumbai, Malvan has more of a serene feel detached from the busiest hub of India. Based in the Sindhugarh district, it isn’t much developed yet, but that’s what the advantage here is. With the clean backwaters, the corals will leave you captivated. Water sports are plenty, though most of them similar to the ones at Goa. Tsunami Island nearby is a leading crowd-gainer with its switching invisibility mode. It is reported to be visible with low tide and the waters own it when the tide is high. If scuba diving has got all your attention up, it’s time to start packing away!<b></b></p><p data-spotid="392092"><b>Distance from Mumbai - 489 Kms</b></p><p data-spotid="392092"><b>How to get there: </b>Malvan does not have a railhead of its own.
