 5. Ghantoot Beach, Abu-dhabi 









 Tourists hoping to get a respite from the heat of Dubai choose to travel along the Sheikh Zayed Road towards Abu Dhabi to access the private beach of Ghantoot. The area is one of the most popular local spots for holding beach parties, yet it remains less crowded ordinarily with only about a handful of people at the beachfront on weekdays. It has turned out to be an open secret of Emiratis and Expat population who are often found heading out of the city to this fantastic beach. Sundown finds the crowd head towards the bar that can also be reached via the pool.
