Usually a less crowded area. I will suggest going between 0530-0630pm or 0550-0640am for the nicest view. You will get plenty of space if you are planning to play football.A H — Google reviewClean beach, however approach road is under construction nowdays.
However traffic police manages everything perfectly.
Paid parking available at 70rs per 6 hours.Amit R — Google reviewPeaceful and breezy spot in the middle of the city chaos. Aksa Beach is clean, calm, and perfect for a relaxing walk. Great place to unwind, especially during sunriseBijal P — Google reviewIt is an amazing beach. The best place to sit on the beach is towards the south end where water flows from the mangrove tree zone area into the ocean and gives a feeling of a small river stream.Ashish Y — Google reviewIt's a really clean beach. Felt very good over here. It was very peaceful and serene. We went during the afternoon to evening. It has some bad reputation due to from old times but I don't think those things are valid anymore at least during the day definitely I can vouch for. It's not like other beaches which are crowded.Dhruvin S — Google reviewAksa Beach is a peaceful spot away from the city's hustle, great for a quiet walk or sunset view. The beach is less commercialized, which adds to its charm, but the water isn’t ideal for swimming due to strong currents and safety warnings. Cleanliness can vary, and facilities are limited, so plan accordingly. Overall, a decent place for a short, relaxing visit.Krishna G — Google reviewNice Beach, but crowded on weekends.
Being around Mumbai, water is a bit dirty. Swimming is not recommended.
People should avoid littering and keep the beach clean.DEV N — Google reviewAksa Beach provides a lively experience with plenty of food and snack stalls along the shore. Visitors can enjoy a variety of local treats while taking in the scenic views, especially around sunset. The beach is often bustling with families and friends, creating a vibrant atmosphere.

It offers swimmable waters and breathtaking sunset views over the Arabian Sea. The beach is known for its clean sandy and rocky landscape and is popular among couples and youngsters seeking solace away from city life. Versova Beach also features a colorful fishing village with a vibrant fish market, making it an ideal spot for relaxation and enjoying mesmerizing sunsets.A Perfect place to hang out with friends.
And usually less busy than Juhu beach.
Horse riding and jet skiing is also available sometimes.Animesh P — Google reviewI have only visited Versova Beach once and it was an amazing experience. It had more space to walk and enjoy the evening breeze.
You could sit on the sides and relax, click pictures and enjoy the waters.
There are eateries nearby to fill your tummy.
Less crowds is the selling point of the Beach. The only negative aspect was the garbage. The beach was not clean which is the case with all beaches. People should really understand how their actions hurt others experience.Rishi R — Google reviewDon't expect much from this place except calmness. Less crowded compared to other beaches in the morning. It was maintained well. Was able to see the moon set 😅 in the morning, I guess it would be better in the evenings.Aravinda S — Google reviewIn my opinion, every beach is serene. Versova beach is no exception. 10 mins walking distance from Versova Metro Station.

If walking, avoid going by the slums route (near thorats barbecue misal) because there's a lot of trash and snack stalls are far. Walk a little more and take Persian Darbar's route aka Main Entrance (extra 5-10 mins walking).

Sharing rickshaw from the metro station will cost 20rs per person, it will drop you near the main entrance.

Kalkhatta Gola is for 50rs, Mix Gola is for 60rs. You can tell the vendor to make a normal Gola to avoid fancy heart shape. You can rent a beach mat for 150rs or sit on the rocks. Don't throw litter, carry your trash out with you and dispose it in a dustbin. Be responsible and enjoy!Draksha K — Google reviewAmazing, quiet beach. What a difference from crowded Juhu beach. And not that far away. I would choose peace and quiet over crowds and popularity any time. Perfect for sunset watching and walks on the beach.Ewa T — Google reviewI recently visited this beach and was surprised to see it so clean. There is a drive on cleaning Versova beach and the team has done a wonderful job and hope this continue and the public using it ensure that it’s maintain the way it’s now. Keep up the good work !Munish P — Google reviewVersova Beach is a hidden gem nestled in the bustling city of Mumbai. With its long stretch of golden sand, the beach is perfect for an early morning stroll or winding down after a hectic day. The rhythmic sound of the waves, the cool sea breeze, and the distant call of the fishermen setting out to sea create a serene atmosphere that’s hard to find in a metro city.

Top Highlights of this Beach –
• Scenic views: Versova’s coastline offers a beautiful sunrise view with the sea reflecting soft pastels. It’s an ideal spot for photographers and nature lovers.
• Cleanliness efforts: The beach has come a long way, thanks to regular clean-up drives organized by local volunteers. You’ll often see community members picking up plastic and debris, making the shoreline more enjoyable.
• Community vibe: There’s a strong local presence here. Fishermen at work, kids flying kites, and families spending time together give the beach a warm, communal feel.

Things to Know:
• Crowd levels: Weekends and evenings can get busy, especially during festive seasons. If you prefer tranquility, visiting early in the morning is best.
• Facilities: Basic amenities are available public toilets and a few food stalls serving chai, snacks, and seafood. However, don’t expect luxury cafés or upscale eateries.
• Safety: The sea can be rough at times. Swim only in designated zones and stay near lifeguard-patrolled areas. The beach is generally safe during daylight hours.

My Experience:
I visited on a serene weekday morning. The cool breeze, soft sand underfoot, and the sight of fishermen mending nets made it a calming escape. I joined a local clean-up drive, which added meaning to my visit. Though facilities are simple, the real charm lies in the untouched, local ambience.

Overall, Versova Beach is a must-visit for anyone looking for a quieter, more authentic Ayurvedic sea-breeze escape in Mumbai. I’d recommend adding your own touch by participating in volunteer activities or simply enjoying a peaceful walk.Amandeep G — Google reviewNeed to be cleaned, else good place for spending time with your loved onesTech U — Google reviewBharat Nagar, Versova, Andheri West, Maharashtra, India•Tips and more reviews for Versova Beach4Gorai BeachSave4.2(6236)•3.5(178)•Mentioned on +16 other lists BeachOutdoor ActivitiesGorai Beach, nestled in the Gorai creek near Essel World, is a popular day-trip destination for locals.

For sunset this beach is good to enjoy and chillReynation7 — Google reviewThe usual beach 🏖️ case scenario like any other beach. The approach road to reach the beach is too narrow. So narrow that only one vehicle can pass at a time & road itself causes Traffic Jam. The beac soil is black. You can find Cafés & Sea food eateries nearby.
The water is dirty.
Go here if you want to enjoy sunset 🌇 with waves..Varun G — Google reviewGorai Beach is decent if you're looking for a quick escape from city life. It’s relatively cleaner than some other Mumbai beaches, but weekends can get quite crowded. Best to go on a weekday. The horse rides and ATV bikes add some fun for kids. It could be better maintained, but overall, a good experience.Yogesh B — Google reviewWent on the weekend by foot from Gorai Creek to Gorai beach and loved the atmosphere here.
Sunset 🌇 is very serene and this beach ⛱️ gives a picturesque view of it with shorelines beautifully maintained.Kunwar N — Google reviewCrowded and chaotic with beautiful views of the sunset
The beach is jam packed in the evenings. Need to move away from the crowda to enjoy some solitude

The distressing part is that vehicles are allowed all the way into the beach. In low tides the cars go all the way in

The authorities are just setting up for some incident to happen.

ATVs are all over place. Kids cannot be left alone

On top of all these its a mess to get in and especially get out post susnet
The exit road is a mess due to all vehicles trying to get out. Hailing an auto becomes difficult

Would not visit again

What a mess.Sharad K — Google reviewVery neat and less crowded
Underated beach
Decent shacks quite expensive
Less options of commute
Please don’t contaminate this beachHrithika M — Google reviewBest place to visit with family. The beach is completely flat. Hence, safe for kids. Water sports activities are available. Quad bikes, horse riding, etc are available for add-on enjoyment. Snack items are there. The only concern is the entry and exit road since it's very narrow.

Good Beach if your are living nearby in hotels. It took hardly 15 min away from Uttan. Clean beach with Speed boat, horse ride, Multi Utility Vehicle Ride etc. Beach has about 4-5 Restaurants where you can have meal after you roam around. Dont park you vehicle at night because of High Tide.

Great beach, seawater isn't somewhere you would put your feet in. And its hard to access, very small roads and google maps gets it wrong so you are technically on locals to find the route, google will take you to a route thats only for small vehicles, not cars. But amazing viewsVikas K — Google reviewSunsets are extremely beautiful.
Lots of places to eat and beach cafe’s!
Beaches are clean as well and kids can also enjoy.
Must visit during summers, there are plenty of shaded areas and the view of the sunset is breathtaking. It wasn’t overly crowded, which made it even more enjoyable.

If you have large SUVs like fortuner then you may find some difficulty taking it to beach.

And you can take your vehicle to the beach as there is no parking on the road.

There is a bathroom at the entrance (on the left side) but not maintained at all. Ladies side is totally useless.

Beach itself is good enough. It's both Rocky and Sandy so nice to take pictures and all. Fairly clean.

The main attraction for me were the lots of tiny crabs. Children enjoyed running behind them.

They have few horse rides at the beach. You will find gola walas, but I did not find corns.

Verdict: It's a good beach not much crowded. So you can definitely relax and enjoy your time here.

Rated 4.5/5 stars.

The beach was clean, peaceful, and not crowded, which made it perfect for swimming and relaxing. We swam from 1 PM to 6 PM, and the changing tide levels throughout the day added to the experience. Around 1 PM, the water was shallow and far from the rocks, but by 5–6 PM, the waves had risen and started hitting the stones at the edge of the beach. Sitting on those rocks and feeling the waves crash against me was just an amazing feeling.

Just a heads-up—the water is extremely salty. I had a bit of discomfort in my eyes, and even got a slight ear infection, but it’s all fine now after a doctor visit.

We carried biryani, had a mini picnic in the evening, and responsibly cleaned the area before leaving. There were a few local food stalls nearby too.

It’s a great spot for photography, family outings, or just peace of mind.

Tips for first-time visitors:

Avoid going deep if you don’t know how to swim.

Carry your own food and water—but please clean up afterward.

Best time to visit is early morning or late afternoon to avoid harsh heat.

The tide level rises in the evening, so plan your swim time accordingly.

Don’t forget sunscreen and sunglasses!Shravan M — Google reviewUran Beach is a hidden gem just a two-hour drive from Kalyan! It's the perfect getaway for anyone looking to unwind and enjoy some natural beauty. The beach is absolutely stunning, especially during sunset—definitely a sight to behold!

Enjoy your visit!Chandan S — Google reviewRelaxing and peaceful destination with clean shores and a serene atmosphere.

As someone used to the white sands and clear waters of South African beaches 🇿🇦🏖️, I found the beach here quite different — the sand was darker, and the water had a brownish hue, which might surprise first-time visitors.

There’s a strong, unpleasant smell — something like rotten waste — that hits you as soon as you arrive. The pollution here is quite noticeable, with garbage scattered along the shore and in the water. It’s unfortunate because the place has potential to be a clean and serene coastal spot.

Unlike the crowded sandy beaches often found near major cities, Pirwadi offers a unique charm with its mix of sand and distinct rocky stretches. This makes it an ideal spot for leisurely strolls, collecting seashells, or simply unwinding by the sea.
The real highlight of Pirwadi Nagaon Beach is its breathtaking sunsets. The sky transforms into a canvas of vibrant colors, creating a truly magical experience that is perfect for photography or quiet contemplation. While not traditionally suited for swimming due to its rocky nature and sometimes murky water, the calm ambiance more than makes up for it.
Visitors often appreciate the relaxed atmosphere, making it a great destination for a family outing or a serene evening with friends. You can find small food stalls nearby offering local snacks and fresh seafood, adding to the authentic coastal experience. The approach road is generally good, and parking is usually not an issue, making it a convenient day trip from Navi Mumbai.

Anyway you can visit i recommend this place its nice and remember about the corners of the beach premises the couples doing nasty things so when you go with family avoid going to the corners 😂😂😂Divyesh P — Google reviewGirgaon Chowpatty was an okay experience. The beach has a nice vibe, especially in the evenings with all the street food stalls and the view of the sunset. However, it was quite crowded and not very clean, which took away from the experience. It's a decent spot to visit if you're nearby, but I wouldn’t go out of my way to come here again.Zeeshan A — Google reviewAnother beaches that Mumbai is famous for. Not very clean water though, but people come and enjoy it in the evening and stay late at night enjoying their favourite food from the stalls. They provide an indian sitting system.

A perfect gateway for summers
But the government officials and police aren't allowing to step in beach,
I don't know the reason but it's very upsetting.

If cleanliness is improved, it could become one of the best beaches ever.Aswin C — Google reviewit is a good beach but its quite dirty, not recommended for kids to play on this beach. even tho the view of the sealink is beautiful but nowadays its barely visible cause of the pollutionTanmayee A — Google reviewDadar Beach, often overshadowed by the more famous Juhu and Marine Drive, is a hidden gem right in the middle of Mumbai. Located near the bustling area of Dadar, this beach offers a peaceful escape from the city’s hectic pace. It may not be as polished as other Mumbai beaches, but that’s where its charm lies—it’s raw, authentic, and closer to the everyday life of Mumbaikars.

When you visit Dadar Beach, the first thing you’ll notice is the calm atmosphere. The crowds are much smaller here, making it an ideal spot for those who want to enjoy some quiet time by the sea. The beach is especially popular among locals who come here for their morning and evening walks, to sit by the shore, or just to watch the sunset. And let me tell you, the sunsets here are truly something special—when the sun dips into the Arabian Sea, the sky lights up with beautiful shades of orange and pink. It’s a sight that stays with you long after you leave.

Another unique aspect of Dadar Beach is its proximity to Chaitya Bhoomi, the memorial of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar. This adds a layer of cultural and historical significance to the area, making it more than just a spot for leisure.

While the beach may not have the fancy eateries or tourist amenities of Juhu, it’s the simplicity and serenity of Dadar Beach that makes it so special. It’s a place where you can connect with the sea, the city, and perhaps even yourself. For anyone looking to experience the quieter side of Mumbai, Dadar Beach is definitely worth a visit.Dinkar N — Google reviewThe beach is only accessible during low tide, during which it is quite dirty. There's also a significant risk of drowning when the tide changes as there is no life guard nearby. However, the beach is refreshing visit given the rush atmosphere in Mumbai.Akash B — Google reviewVery well managed and beautiful place to spend an awesome evening.Amsu K — Google reviewMaharashtra, India•Tips and more reviews for Dadar Beach22Mahim BeachSave4.0(912)•Mentioned on 1 list BeachMahim Beach is a beautiful beach in Mumbai, India. It is known for its clear water and stunning views of the city. Mahim Beach is a great place to relax and enjoy the scenic beauty of the beaches.Ah, Mahim Beach! It’s one of the more understated beaches in Mumbai, compared to its more famous counterparts like Juhu or Marine Drive, but it has its own charm.

### Mahim Beach Overview:
- **Location**: Situated in the Mahim area, this beach offers a quiet escape from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai city. It's located near the Mahim Causeway, making it fairly accessible.

- **Scenic View**: The beach offers views of the Arabian Sea, but the surrounding environment isn’t as pristine as some of the more popular beaches in Mumbai. There's a view of the Mahim Bay and the Bandra-Worli Sea Link from a distance, though it’s not as iconic as the one from the Bandra Sea Face area.

- **Atmosphere**: It’s generally a quieter spot compared to other beaches. On weekdays, it’s calm, but on weekends, it can attract some locals. You’ll find people strolling, playing cricket, or simply sitting and enjoying the breeze. However, the beach isn’t the cleanest, which can be a turn-off for some visitors.

- **Activities**: While Mahim Beach isn't particularly famous for water sports, you can often find people walking along the shore or kids playing. It’s more of a spot for relaxation and casual visits.

- **Nearby Attractions**: The famous **Mahim Dargah** is located close to the beach, which is a popular religious site. There are also some cafes and small eateries nearby, so grabbing a bite is never a problem.

### Pros:
- **Less Crowded**: Compared to other beaches like Juhu or Marine Drive, Mahim Beach tends to be less crowded, offering a more laid-back experience.
- **Local Vibe**: The area feels authentically Mumbai, with local vendors, small shops, and residents going about their daily lives.

### Cons:
- **Cleanliness**: The beach isn’t as well-maintained as other tourist-heavy beaches in the city. You may find some litter and debris around the shore.
- **Water Quality**: Like many other Mumbai beaches, the water quality isn’t great for swimming. It's not the most ideal beach for water activities.

### Final Thoughts:
Mahim Beach isn’t the most glamorous beach in Mumbai, but it offers a quieter, local experience. If you’re looking for a more peaceful, off-the-beaten-path location to unwind, it's a good choice. Just keep your expectations in check regarding cleanliness and amenities.Tasmiya S — Google reviewFirst of all it's not a beach as such. Just a sea view spot. The shores are pretty dirty.

Visiting in January, the view was underwhelming, though it was a lesser-known spot, disappointingly it's littered with trash and waste.
Surprisingly, exploring the town and walking through the pathways by people's homes was more enjoyable than the beach itself.Ila L — Google review"Versova Beach is a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of Mumbai, offering a peaceful and scenic experience. The vast stretch of sand and the rhythmic sound of waves make it a perfect spot for a relaxing evening or an early morning walk.

The beach has seen remarkable improvement in cleanliness over the years, thanks to community efforts, making it a more enjoyable place to visit. It’s less crowded compared to Juhu Beach, which adds to its charm and tranquility.

One of the highlights of Versova Beach is its stunning sunsets. The view of the sun dipping into the Arabian Sea is truly mesmerizing and perfect for photography enthusiasts. It’s also a popular spot for locals to enjoy some fresh seafood from nearby stalls.

While the beach has its natural beauty, occasional littering can still be an issue. Continued efforts to maintain its cleanliness will further enhance its appeal.
