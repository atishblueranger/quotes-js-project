    "detail_description": "These modest gardens, inconveniently located halfway between Barrio Bolonia and the Plaza Monumental on Av Bolívar (well, it’s convenient if you’re making the hot 40-minute walk between them), features more than 200 species of plants, divided into Nicaragua’s five major life zones. Of these only the dry tropical forest and central lowlands look happy. Your fee includes a guided tour, where you’ll see a madriño, the national tree, and sacuanjoche, the national flower.\n"

    "detail_description": "Home to what’s easily Managua’s most recognizable landmark, Sandino’s somber silhouette, this national historic park was once the site of the Casa Presidencial, where Sandino and his men were executed in 1934; what looks like a dilapidated parking structure was for decades one of Nicaragua’s most notorious prisons.\nYou can see Sandino, hastily erected by the departing Frente Sandinista de Liberación Nacional (FSLN; Sandinista National Liberation Front) government after its electoral loss in 1990, from almost anywhere in town; begin your ascent at the Crowne Plaza. You’ll pass Monumento Roosevelt, constructed in 1939, with lovely lake views (today it's a memorial to those killed in the revolution).The top of Loma de Tiscapa is actually the lip of Volcán Tiscapa’s beautiful little crater lake, with incredible views of the city, both cathedrals and Volcán Momotombo. Keep in mind that, despite a vigorous clean-up campaign, the lake is polluted with untreated sewage."

Though its neoclassical facade is beautiful and serene, attended by stone angels and dappled in golden light, its interior is empty and off-limits: a cathedral without a heart in a city without a center.\n"

    "detail_description": "Discovered by miners in 1874, these fossilized tracks record the passage of perhaps 10 people – men, women and children – as well as birds, raccoons, deer and possum across the muddy shores of Lago de Managua some 6000 to 8000 years ago. Despite early speculation that they were running from a volcanic eruption, forensics specialists have determined that these folks were in no hurry – and, interestingly, were fairly tall at between 145cm and 160cm. Come here by taxi (US$2 to US$4).\nThe excavation was undertaken by the Carnegie Foundation in 1941 and 1942, and unearthed 14 layers, or 4m, of earth. They found some later Chorotega ceramics (about 2m down) and other intriguing artifacts, though there’s no money to take it further. The nifty on-site museum, with human skulls, a fossilized bison track and lots of ceramics, was closed for renovation at research time, but there's a detailed bilingual exhibition on the excavations and different theories surrounding the footprints. Don’t skip this one; it’s an international treasure."
