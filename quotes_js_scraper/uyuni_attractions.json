    "detail_description": "The only real attraction in Uyuni, Cementerio de Trenes is a rusty collection of historic steam locomotives and rail cars dating back to the 19th century, when there was a rail-car factory here. Today they sit decaying in the yards about 3km southwest of the modern-day station along Av Ferroviaria.\nThey’re fun to climb on, and it’s a nice walk from town to keep you warm. Most tours visit the train cemetery as a first or last stop on the three-day salar (salt desert) circuit."
