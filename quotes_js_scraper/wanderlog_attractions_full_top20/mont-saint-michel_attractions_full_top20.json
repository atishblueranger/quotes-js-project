The 'La Merveille' section is a remarkable display of medieval artistry, and the challenges of transporting building materials across the Bay of Saint-Michel make its construction even more impressive. Separate tickets are required for visiting the island, with adult admission priced at $10 and free entry available for EU citizens or French residents under 25.",
