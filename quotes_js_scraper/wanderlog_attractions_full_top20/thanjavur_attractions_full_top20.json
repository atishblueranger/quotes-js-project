Constructed in 1779 by Raja Serfoji to honor his mentor, Reverend Christian Friedrich Schwartz—a Danish missionary—the church showcases a beautiful blend of European and Indian architectural styles. Its pristine white façade and tranquil ambiance make it an inviting place for visitors seeking both spiritual solace and a glimpse into colonial history.",
