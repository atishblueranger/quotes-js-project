The idea for this monument was conceived by South Dakota State Historian Doane Robinson as a way to attract tourists and boost the economy of South Dakota. Sculptor Gutzon Borglum was hired to carve the granite spires, but he chose Mount Rushmore instead due to the fragility of the original site.",
