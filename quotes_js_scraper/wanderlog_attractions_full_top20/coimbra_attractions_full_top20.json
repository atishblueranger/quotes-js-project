The monastery, located near the Mondego River, was abandoned and neglected for over 300 years, resulting in remarkably well-preserved yet partially submerged ruins. Visitors can explore the hulking remains, including crumbling cloisters and a dilapidated bell tower that now hosts music concerts and events.",
