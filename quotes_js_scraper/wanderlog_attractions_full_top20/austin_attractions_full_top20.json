        "detail_description": "South Congress Bridge, located in downtown Austin, is home to the largest urban bat colony in North America. Every summer night, around 1.5 million Mexican free-tail bats emerge from under the bridge, creating a spectacular sight that attracts hundreds of visitors. The best time to witness this natural phenomenon is at dusk when the bats take flight for their nightly hunt. The view of downtown Austin from the bridge is stunning and adds to the experience of watching the bats in action.",
