        "detail_description": "The White Sea is a remarkable beach that offers stunning views, making it an ideal spot for photography. It is particularly popular among fishermen, but the sand here does not differ much from other beaches. Despite its lack of water sports and other activities, this beach provides a serene and tranquil atmosphere. With its white sand covered in shells and accompanied by a cooling breeze carrying small particles of sand, visitors can find solace and tranquility here.",
