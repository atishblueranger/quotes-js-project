It connects the Neckar River to Neuenheim Old Town and is made of classic red sandstone. The bridge leads to the romantic ruins of an old castle that once served as a heavily fortified Gothic stronghold and later as one of Germany's most magnificent residences. Unfortunately, much of the structure was destroyed during wars in the 17th century and never rebuilt.",
