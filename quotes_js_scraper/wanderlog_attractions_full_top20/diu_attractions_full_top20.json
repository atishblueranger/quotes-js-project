Positioned close to the beach, this park offers endless entertainment for children and adults alike. However, it would be even more captivating if it featured an abundance of dinosaur sculptures. The park grants visitors a mesmerizing view of the sea and also boasts a small temple on its grounds. Though expansive, caution must be exercised when approaching the rocky shoreline as it poses potential danger.",
