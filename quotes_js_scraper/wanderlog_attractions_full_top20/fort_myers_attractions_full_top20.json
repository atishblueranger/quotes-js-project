The area serves as a corridor for various animals such as bears and panthers, although spotting them is rare. Visitors can expect to see alligators, egrets, woodpeckers, herons, and turtles while strolling along the well-maintained boardwalk. Once heavily logged for cypress trees, the preserve was protected thanks to student activism.",
