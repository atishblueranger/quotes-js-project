These bunkers, located near Corbyns Cove, serve as a testament to the protection needed during wartime. Constructed between 1942 and 1945, they were part of the Japanese army's invasion of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Visiting this place offers a unique experience and insight into foreign invasions during that time period.",
