        "detail_description": "Christ Church Cathedral is a medieval place of worship in Dublin, Ireland. It has a rich history dating back to the 11th century when the first Christianized Danish king built a wooden church at the site. The present stone structure was constructed around 1200 and underwent extensive renovations in the 19th century, giving it a Victorian appearance. The cathedral features a crypt that measures over 60 meters in length and has served various purposes throughout its lifetime, including as a marketplace and pub.",
