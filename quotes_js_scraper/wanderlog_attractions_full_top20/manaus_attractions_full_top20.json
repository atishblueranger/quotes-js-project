The grill uses fire and embers, incorporating ancestral techniques from the northwest Amazon. Classic dishes like fish, shrimp, and meat are elevated with new textures and ingredients that evoke the flavors of the forest. Chef Felipe Schaedler transforms Amazonian bounty into surprising fare, such as crunchy tambaqui ribs.",
