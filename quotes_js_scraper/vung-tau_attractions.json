    "detail_description": "Come here for a stupendous private collection of military arms, uniforms and paraphernalia from across the globe. One section is dedicated to the conflict in Vietnam, another to the French Colonial period and there are Chinese, European and even Zulu exhibits. Robert Taylor, who has spent 50 years amassing and curating the collection, is often at hand to provide explanations. The attention to detail is superb and there are excellent descriptions in English and Vietnamese.\n"

From Cau Da Pier on Ð Ha Long, take a sharp right on the alley north of the Hai Au Hotel, then roll on up the hill. Although Jesus and the lighthouse look temptingly close, it is not possible to walk or drive directly between them; there is a military base in the hills here.\n"

It's possible to ascend to the arms for a panoramic view of Vung Tau. Note you cannot enter the actual statue in vest-tops or shorts.\nSome 800-odd stairs wind their way up the mountain, a Vietnamese version of stairway to heaven, but it is possible to take a short cut by motorbike up a bumpy mountain road if you can find a local who knows the way. It starts from Hem 220, off Ð Phan Chu Trinh."
