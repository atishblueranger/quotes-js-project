Expect a line out the door and around the block for this one – as the centerpiece of Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park, it's the prime attraction in a city packed with history, and one of Philly's top free things to do.\n\n  \nThe iconic bell-tower of Philadelphia's Independence Hall ©f11photo / Shutterstock\n\nDiving into American history at Independence Hall \nTo prime yourself for a trip to Independence Hall, watch Nicolas Cage's absurdist treasure hunt movie National Treasure, for insights into what the founding fathers didn't do in Philadelphia in 1776, then join the queue for this national monument, to find out what actually did happen. Inside, you'll be led around the chambers where both the United States Constitution and the Declaration of Independence were debated and written into law, and where the body of Abraham Lincoln was displayed in state after his assassination in 1865.\nWhile you're here, it would be remiss to not drop in on the string of other American landmarks in the Independence National Historical Park. The legendary Liberty Bell, cast in Whitechapel in London, originally dangled inside the bell-tower of Independence Hall. It now hangs inside a protective pavilion, with its famous crack proudly on display – perhaps a warning about the fragility of democracy?\n\n  \nMay 9, 2015: inside the Liberty Bell Center housing the symbol of American independence in Philadelphia. ©Ritu Manoj Jethani/Shutterstock\n\nAdjacent to Independence Hall, the American Philosophical Society was founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1743 to promote 'useful knowledge', and next door is the Old City Hall, where the US Supreme Court sat until 1800. Across the road, the Second Bank of the US was the home of the national bank until 1836 (the First Bank of the US lies just east across the park).\nAfter immersing yourself in the official version of American history, spare a moment to consider the African American experience of events. The nearby Presidents House Site monument tells the story of the nine enslaved African Americans who were part of Washington's household. It's a powerful reminder of the paradox at the heart of the birth of the USA.\n\n  \nIndependence Hall's Assembly Room, where the US Constitution and Declaration of Independence were signed ©Inspired By Maps / Shutterstock\n\nTickets &amp; Practicalities\nEntry to Independence Hall is by guided tour only, so get free advance tickets and times for the next available tour at the nearby Independence Visitor Center or reserve online (with a $1 booking fee). Only 50 people are allowed on each tour, so factor in at least an hour-long wait in peak summer months. The entrance is via the security screening area in the east wing on the corner of Chestnut and 5th Sts. The easiest place to park is the Autopark at Independence Mall, by the Independence Visitor Center.\nWhere to eat near Independence Hall\nExploring history can be hungry work – swap patriotism for physical sustenance at these nearby places to eat.\nFriedaCity TavernThe Bourse\n"

        "detail_description": "This L-shaped Philadelphia park, bound by 6th, 2nd, Walnut and Arch Sts, protects and honors the institutions that formed the foundation of the United States. Every American school child knows the stories of the venerated monuments dotted around Independence National Historical Park, and the world-changing events that happened here; for outsiders, it's a crash course in America's founding legends.\n\n  \nIndependence Hall – not only a landmark but a national icon ©Diego Grandi / Shutterstock\n\nExploring history at Independence National Historical Park\nIn the interests of educating the nation, many of the sights in the National Historical Park are free to visit, and with so much to see, this is one of the top pocket-friendly days out in the country. Stroll around and you'll see the storied buildings in which the seeds for the Revolutionary War were planted and the sites where the institutions of the US government came into being. You'll also find beautiful, shaded lawns frequented by squirrels, pigeons and, in warmer months, costumed actors. Set aside a whole day to make the most of the historic sights, with rest stops in the park and at local cafes and restaurants.\nThe logical starting point is Independence Hall, the spire-topped Georgian mansion that bookmarks the south end of the park. The building served as the Pennsylvania State House in colonial times, but in 1776, leaders of the Thirteen Colonies –  including Benjamin Franklin, John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, but not George Washington, who was away leading troops in New York – came together and signed the Declaration of Independence, officially launching the United States of America as a legal entity.\n\n  \nThe Liberty Bell, with its iconic crack ©dszc / Getty Images\n\nAmerica's first president was in attendance at Independence Hall on 17 September 1787, when the US Constitution was signed into law (indeed, George Washington added the first signature). Across the lawn in front of the mansion is another American icon, the Liberty Bell, which was rung to mark the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence. \nThe bell once pealed in the bell-tower of Independence Hall, but now hangs in a dedicated pavilion; the famous crack developed in the 19th century, a result of miscalculations in the mix of metals used when the bell was cast. Nearby, you'll find the American Philosophical Society, founded by Benjamin Franklin in 1743 to promote 'useful knowledge', and the Old City Hall, where the US Supreme Court sat until 1800. Across the road, the Second Bank of the US was the home of the national bank until 1836 (the First Bank of the US lies just east). Other buildings that played lesser roles in the national struggle are dotted around the park.\n\n  \nLearn your rights at the National Constitution Center ©Ritu Manoj Jethani / Shutterstock\n\nModern museums interpreting America's struggle for independence can be found at the edges of the park. North of Independence Hall, the National Constitution Center brings the US Constitution to life using actors and interactive exhibits, and you can admire an original copy of the Bill of Rights, the document that enshrined in law the right to free speech and the right to bear arms. East of Independence Hall, the Museum of the American Revolution uses a broad range of media to explain the 'why' behind America's quest for independence from Britain. Statesman and polymath, Benjamin Franklin gets his time in the sun nearby at the Benjamin Franklin Museum.\nThere's a growing maturity about the contradictions of America's founding story. The African American experience of events is told powerfully at the Presidents House Site on the location of George Washington's former offices, exploring the lives of the nine enslaved African Americans who were part of the Washington household. It's a thought-provoking reminder of the paradox at the heart of the story of American freedom.\n\n  \nFlowers bring a flash of colour to Independence Hall ©f11photo / Shutterstock\n\nTickets &amp; Practicalities\nEntry to Independence Hall is by guided tour only, and you'll need to book a free advance ticket at the nearby Independence Visitor Center or reserve online (with a $1 booking fee). Only 50 people are allowed on each tour, so budget for at least an hour-long wait in peak summer months. Entry to the Liberty Bell pavilion and most other historic buildings is free and un-ticketed, though there are often queues in summer.  \nThe main paid-for sights are the Museum of the American Revolution, the National Constitution Center, and the Benjamin Franklin Museum, and advance booking is recommended for all three. The easiest place to park is the Autopark at Independence Mall, by the Independence Visitor Center.\nWhere to eat near Independence Hall\nWading through this much history will give you an appetite – break up the patriotism with physical nourishment at these nearby places to eat.\nFriedaCity TavernThe Bourse\n"

Check online for details of special events.\nUSS Olympia became one of America's most distinguished warships because of her role as Commodore Dewey's flagship in the 1898 Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish-American War. The result of this decisive battle saw the Spanish fleet – largely considered superior to their American adversaries – crippled for the duration of the war, revealing the US as an emerging world power. During WWI the ship patrolled the waters of the US East Coast and, at the end of that war, carried home the body of the Unknown Solider from France to Arlington National Cemetery. The ship was decommissioned in 1922.USS Becuna, a 1944 Balao-class submarine, was the flagship sub of General MacArthur's Southwest Pacific Fleet. During WWII it destroyed three Japanese vessels and patrolled the Java and China Seas as well as the coast of the Philippines. The sub also saw service during the Korean and Vietnam Wars before being decommissioned in 1969."

Benjamin Rush, a signer of the Declaration of Independence and among the first white revolutionaries to speak out against slavery, was an initial supporter. It later became a stop on the Underground Railroad when Pastor Allen (entombed in the church) hid hundreds of fugitive slaves prior to the Civil War. There's a small museum in the church dedicated to Allen and a statue of him stands outside."

        "detail_description": "Home to the oldest Jewish Ashkenazi congregation in the US, Rodeph Shalom is one of the most beautiful pieces of religious architecture in Philadelphia. The 1927 building, designed by Simon &amp; Simon, features Babylonian and Assyrian patterns on its exterior, while the spectacular domed interior is a riot of stenciled mosaics, gilt and stained glass with Byzantine and Moorish allusions.\nHistorians bemoan the fact that a Frank Furness–designed synagogue was torn down in the 1920s to create this building. Photos of the Furness building hang in the synagogue's contemporary main entrance, added in 2015, which also includes an interesting Museum of Jewish Art."

The line – and it can be a long one in peak summer months – starts on the building's northern end.\nThe gist of the story: originally called the State House Bell, it was made in 1751, to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Pennsylvania's constitution. Mounted in Independence Hall, it tolled on the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence. The crack developed in the 19th century, and the bell was retired in 1846."

You can also see art exhibitions here at the Arthur Ross Gallery."

Below ground level is a food court and shopping mall, which links directly to Suburban railway station."
