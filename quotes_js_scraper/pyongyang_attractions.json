    "detail_description": "Every itinerary includes an homage to these vast bronze statues of the smiling Great Leader and Dear Leader, the latter in his trademark parka. The first statue was unveiled in 1972 to celebrate Kim Il-sung's 60th birthday, while the second one was added in 2012. The original statue was initially covered in gold leaf, but this was removed at the objection of the Chinese, who were effectively funding the North Korean economy, and today's scrubbed bronze prevailed.\nAs the epicentre of the Kim cult, visitors need to be aware of the seriousness (officially, at least) with which North Koreans regard this monument and the respect they believe visitors should accord it. Your tour leader will buy flowers and elect one member of the group to place them at the statue’s feet. As this is done, the whole group will be expected to bow. Photographers will be instructed never to photograph one part of the monument – all pictures should be of the entire statue to avoid causing offence."

    "detail_description": "Several films a year are churned out by the country’s main film studios in the suburbs of Pyongyang. The two main focuses are predictably the anti-Japanese struggle and the anti-American war. The main complex is a huge, propaganda-filled suite of office buildings where post-production apparently goes on, even though it feels eerily empty. A short uphill drive takes you to the large sets, which are far more fun.\nHere you’ll find a generic ancient Korean town for historic films (you can even dress up as a king or queen and be photographed sitting on a throne carpeted in leopard skin), a 1930s Chinese street, a Japanese street, a South Korean street (look for the massage signs meant to illustrate their compatriots’ moral laxity) and a fairly bizarre range of structures from a collection of ‘European’ buildings."

There’s also an interesting outdoor display of vehicles produced in North Korea."

While the government announced in 1993 that its archaeologists had discovered the tomb of Tan'gun, the founder of the first Korean kingdom, it wasn't until recently that North Korean historians made the incredible 'discovery' that Tan'gun was in fact a member of the Kim clan.\nDuring North Korea's more rational communist period, the government had agreed with most scholars of Korean history that Tan'gun was a mythical figure and that the kingdom of Kochoson (ancient Korea), with its capitals Pyongyang and Asadal, was in fact located in northeast China, if it indeed existed. However, it's been recently 'discovered' that Kochoson was in northern Korea, its capital right where Pyongyang now stands, and that Tan'gun was a real man (and a Kim at that); archaeologists have also discovered his skeletal remains. Those decayed bones (and those said to be of his wife) are on display at a grandly constructed white pyramid mausoleum just outside of Pyongyang. A small museum stands nearby, displaying 'artefacts' from Tan'gun's times, said to have been found in and around the tomb."

The palace is eerie, with bricked-in windows and a vast and empty plaza before it, and the entire experience is easily one of the weirdest you'll have in North Korea (which is quite an accolade).\nTo come here you'll need to be in Pyongyang on a Thursday or Sunday morning and dressed smartly (this means shirts, ties and trousers for men; there are no specific rules for women, but shorts or low-cut tops are no-go). You'll also have to go through airport-style security – you're allowed to take nothing with you – and pass along miles of slow red moving sidewalks and then be dusted off by both automatic shoe cleaners and a giant clothes-dusting machine to ensure no dirt is trampled into either viewing hall. Items on display include the train carriage where Kim Jong-il died, the Dear Leader's boat and a collection of his medals and cars."

    "detail_description": "Perhaps the most interesting museum in Pyongyang, this mouthful of an institution opened its current home in 2013 to mark the 60th anniversary of the end of the Korean War. Outside you'll see war-damaged tanks, weapons and aircraft used by both sides in the conflict, while inside there are dozens of exhibits and a 360-degree diorama of the Battle of Daejon. In the foyer look out for the statue of a young Kim Il-sung, where he looks exactly like his grandson.\n"

One of the more bizarre items on display is a tin of Nivea hand cream that the Dear Leader thoughtfully gifted to factory workers with sore hands. There is also a display of the various Kim regime loyalty badges worn by locals.\n"

You’ll also normally visit a reading room, a classroom, the intranet room and a room full of late-'80s cassette recorders.\n"

Planned as a prestige project but abandoned following the collapse of the USSR, its haunting skeleton sat on the Pyongyang skyline for years as an unavoidable symbol of North Korea's economic failure. In 2008 work began on the hotel again when it was clad in glass, and so while it looks far better than before, it sadly remains empty inside and cannot be visited.\n"

It’s an interesting example of how the North Korean state has incorporated traditional Korean myths into its cult. According to legend, Chollima could cover hundreds of kilometres a day and was untameable. Kim Il-sung appropriated the myth in the period of reconstruction following the Korean War – so that the zeal of the North Korean workers to rebuild their shattered nation and construct monuments to the leadership became known as ‘Chollima Speed’.\n"

The Pueblo has been preserved since then and is moored in central Pyongyang, where it is visited with great pride by groups of North Koreans.\n"

The network, which is made up of two lines, has a simultaneous function as a nuclear bunker in the event of a long-anticipated American invasion. Stations are deep below ground and you can even see blast doors that will close if Pyongyang ever comes under nuclear bombardment.\nNowadays a trip usually takes in several stations, although the entire network can be visited on specialist tours, disproving the long-standing rumours that much of the network isn't actually in use."
