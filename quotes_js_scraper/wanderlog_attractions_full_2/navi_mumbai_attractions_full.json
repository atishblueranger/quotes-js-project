As part of the Mumbai Metropolitan Area, it boasts a lower concentration of factories and industries compared to its bustling neighbor. This factor, combined with a smaller population, contributes to Navi Mumbai's relatively lower pollution levels when contrasted with Mumbai.",

One minor drawback is that some trees are positioned in the middle of the walkway; however, it still allows for easy navigation. In the evenings, soft old Indian songs are occasionally played.",
