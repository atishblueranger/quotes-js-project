        "detail_description": "The سنہری مسجد, also known as the Golden Mosque, is a 17th-century building constructed by a Bundelkhand Chief. It houses a small but impressive collection of regional antiquities and offers a lovely atmosphere against the backdrop of mountains. The entry fee is nominal at Rs 3. The mosque also features the tomb of Aurangazeb, which was built with his hard-earned money, making it worth visiting for its historical significance.",
