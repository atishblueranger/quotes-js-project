Visitors must descend stairs to reach the temple, where they can experience a chilly climate. While there is a waterfall nearby, it is not suitable for bathing. The temple itself offers a serene natural environment, with small picturesque waterfalls in its vicinity. The location and scenery are beautiful, except for the fact that the waterfall receives dirty water from a drainage channel.",
