        "detail_description": "The experience at LUCKY'S Celebrity Wax Museum was enjoyable, with a well-presented display of numerous ideals. However, some visitors felt that the fees were slightly overpriced and the lack of air conditioning diminished the overall customer experience. Nevertheless, this museum is a unique attraction in Mount Abu and is highly recommended for tourists. The wax statues are remarkably realistic, creating an immersive environment. The museum is exceptionally well-organized and maintained meticulously.",
