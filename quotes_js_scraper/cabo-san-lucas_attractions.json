    "detail_description": "Land’s End is the most impressive attraction in Cabo. Hop on a panga (skiff), kayak or stand-up paddleboard and head to El Arco (the Arch), a jagged natural feature that partially fills with the tide. Pelicans, sea lions, sea, sky – this is what brought people to Cabo in the first place, and it’s still magical, despite the backdrop of cruise ships.\n"

Its main focus, though, is on fossils from the local Sierra de la Laguna range. Look for the huge whale skeleton outside its entrance.\n"
