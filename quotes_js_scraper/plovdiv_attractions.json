    "detail_description": "This beige mansion built in 1830 has a special place in Plovdiv hearts as the location where French poet Alphonse de Lamartine stayed in 1833, along the journey upon which his Travels in the East was based. Lamartine wrote effusively about Bulgarian hospitality after his stay, while locals enjoy ever-inflating tales of how they competed to make the wandering Frenchman welcome. At the time of research, it was closed to visitors.\n"

Admire marvellous frescoes and a colourful carved ceiling in the exterior colonnade, and a baroque-style Viennese iconostasis and religious art spanning the 15th to 18th centuries inside. The separate bell tower, bright white with a coppery cap, stands 13m tall.\n"

In recent years the park's Goddess Demeter Fountain and central Viennese-style pavilion have been carefully restored. Tsar Simeon's Lake with the Singing Fountains combines light and water effects; arrive in the park's southwestern corner on a summer Thursday, Friday or Saturday evening around 9pm for the free show.\n"

Most dazzling is the weighty Thracian gold work, part of the Panagyurishte collection, Bulgaria's biggest-ever haul of ancient gold. The museum's most arresting space is a corridor flooded with natural light, which houses Roman-era statues and mosaics. Its enormous centrepiece is a 3rd-century mosaic of a river god encircled by geometric designs.\n"

Krastev's impact on preserving and showcasing Plovdiv's cultural riches has left him fondly remembered as 'mayor of the old town'. His self-portraits and personal collection of (mostly) abstract 20th-century Bulgarian paintings are displayed inside the beautifully furnished house, along with personal mementos. The garden is worth an amble for its red pony murals and scattered artefacts.\n"

Well-manicured flower gardens surround a navy-blue mansion ornamented with golden filigree and topped with a distinctive peaked roof. There is more to admire inside, especially the upper floor's sunshine-yellow walls and carved wooden ceiling hovering above displays of regional costumes.\nThe ground-floor displays of agrarian instruments are a shade less interesting."
