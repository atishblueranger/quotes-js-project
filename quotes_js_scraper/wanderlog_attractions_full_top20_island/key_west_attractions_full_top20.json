Despite its unassuming appearance as a shiny airstream camper parked behind a bar, it has gained popularity in Key West and even attracted the attention of Guy Fieri from Diners Drive Ins and Dives. The restaurant was born out of the owners' dream to open a place in Key West but faced challenges due to high lease prices for traditional spaces.",
