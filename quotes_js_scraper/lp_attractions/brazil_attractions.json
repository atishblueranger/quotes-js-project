    "detail_description": "The Tijuca is all that's left of the Atlantic rainforest that once surrounded Rio de Janeiro. This 39-sq-km tropical-jungle preserve is an exuberant green, with beautiful trees, creeks and waterfalls, mountainous terrain and high peaks. It has an excellent, well-marked trail system. Candomblistas (practitioners of the Afro-Brazilian religion of Candomblé) leave offerings by the roadside; families have picnics; and serious hikers climb the 1012m to the summit of Pico da Tijuca.\nThe heart of the forest is the Alto da Boa Vista area in the Floresta (Forest) da Tijuca, which has many delightful natural and human-made features. Among the highlights of this beautiful park are several waterfalls (Cascatinha de Taunay, Cascata Gabriela and Cascata Diamantina), a 19th-century chapel (Capela Mayrink) and numerous caves (Gruta Luís Fernandes, Gruta Belmiro and Gruta Paulo e Virgínia). Also in the park is a lovely picnic spot (Bom Retiro) and two restaurants – the elegant Restaurante Os Esquilos and Restaurante Barão a Floresta near the ruins of Ruínas do Archer (Major Archer's House).The park is home to many bird and animal species, including iguanas and monkeys, which you might encounter on one of the excellent day hikes you can make here; the trails are well signed. Good, free trail maps are given out at the park entrance.The entire park closes at sunset. It's best to go by car, but if you don't have a vehicle, numerous outfits lead hiking tours, including Jungle Me and Rio Adventures.The best route by car is to take Rua Jardim Botânico two blocks past the Jardim Botânico (heading east from Gávea). Turn left on Lopes Quintas and then follow the Tijuca or Corcovado signs for two quick left turns until you reach the back of the Jardim Botânico, where you turn right. Then follow the signs for a quick ascent into the forest, past the picturesque lookout points of Vista Chinesa and Mesa do Imperador. As soon as you seem to come out of the forest, turn right onto the main road and you'll see the stone columns to the entrance of Alto da Boa Vista on your left after a couple of kilometers. You can also drive up to Alto da Boa Vista by heading out to São Conrado and turning right up the hill at the Parque Nacional da Tijuca signs. Coming from Barra da Tijuca, take Estrada da Barra da Tijuca north, which eventually turns into Rua da Boa Vista, from which there are entrances into the park."

Hiring a guide for this and other local treks is easy (the park service maintains a list of qualified guides), with May through October (the drier months) being the best time to walk.\nThe national park covers 118 sq km of mountainous terrain between Teresópolis and Petrópolis. The park’s most distinctive features are the strangely shaped peaks of Pedra do Sino (2263m), Pedra do Açu (2230m), Agulha do Diabo (2020m), Nariz do Frade (1919m), Dedo de Deus (1651m), Pedra da Ermitage (1485m) and Dedo de Nossa Senhora (1320m). With so many peaks, it’s no wonder that this is the mountain-climbing, rock-climbing and trekking center of Brazil.The main entrance to the national park is at the south edge of the town of Teresópolis, off Hwy BR-116 from Rio, about 4km from the center. Other park entrances can be found at Vale do Bonfim, (20km northeast of Petrópolis) and Guapimirim (in the park's southeastern corner, off the Rio–Teresópolis highway)."

The 'three powers' of the name of the square are executive, legislative and judicial; the president's palace, supreme court and parliament are arranged around it in an equilateral triangle.\nAlso here is the monumental Pavilhão Nacional flagpole, the Panteão da Pátria e da Liberdade Tancredo Neves, a cenotaph commemorating Brazilian national heroes, and two museums detailing the history of Brasília's planning: the Espaço Lúcio Costa and the Museu da Cidade.It’s worth visiting the plaza during the day and again at night for two very different experiences. After dark, surreal lighting casts an eerie glow across the futuristic buildings, as though they are being lit up by the landing lights of an alien spacecraft. Robberies have been reported here at night, though, so have a taxi wait for you while you visit."

The more detailed option (circuito especial; minimum age 14), which takes you into the power plant itself, leaves eight times daily Sunday to Thursday, and 12 times daily on Friday and Saturday. A variety of other attractions within the complex include a museum, wildlife park and river beaches, and a sunset catamaran tour.The project was controversial: it plunged Brazil way into debt and necessitated the large-scale destruction of rainforest and the displacement of 10,000 people. But it cleanly supplies 75% of Paraguay’s energy needs, and 17% of Brazil’s.To get to the Itaipu Dam, catch bus 101 (Vila C Norte-Sohab) or 102 (Vila C Sul-Profilurb), among others (R$3.45, 30 minutes), which leave every 20 to 30 minutes from Foz do Iguaçu's Urban Bus Terminal (TTU)."

Within its boundaries are hundreds and hundreds of miles of hiking trails ranging from afternoon-length jaunts to multiday treks that have the power to astonish even the most seasoned outdoors person.\nThere is little infrastructure in the park itself and nothing in the way of an official entrance (there's no fee to enter the borders of the park) or a central information center, so it's advisable to hire a guide, even for shorter hikes, as it can be quite easy to get lost if you aren't sure where you're going. They’re affordable (plan on around R$200–300 per day for groups of up to six people), and guides are incredibly knowledgeable about local flora and fauna, and they can find the best swimming holes – all priceless in a park with few signs or official trails. In addition some individual sites in the park may have an entry fee, which is typically covered with your guide fee should you use one. For multi-day treks, guides also arrange basic lodging and meals in local homes for the bargain price of around R$100 per person, per day.Guides are plentiful in Lençois and can be arranged through your hotel or directly by keeping your eyes out for people in blue shirts. The Associação dos Condutores de Visitantes de Lençóis has listings of reputable guides and is good resource if you're booking one on your own."

Maracanã played a starring role in the 2014 World Cup when it hosted major games, including the final between Germany and Argentina. The stadium also staged the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2016 Summer Olympics. No matter who takes the field, the 78,800-seat arena comes to life in spectacular fashion on game days.\nFor a quasi-psychedelic experience, go to a football match here. These rate as among the most exciting in the world, particularly during a championship game or when local rivals Flamengo, Vasco da Gama, Fluminense or Botafogo go head to head.Games take place year-round and generally happen on Saturday or Sunday (starting at 4pm or 6pm) or on Wednesday and Thursday (around 8:30pm). Seating at the stadium is by sector, A through F. The north (E and F) and south (C and B) seats are behind the goals and are generally the cheapest and liveliest sections. East (D) and West (A) sectors have better sight lines and are pricier; these have numbered seats and are not as rowdy as the goal seats. Maracanã Mais is part of the west sector, with buffet service included with your ticket. The ticket price is R$40 to R$80 for most games.If you prefer to go in a group, a number of English-speaking tour operators organize game-day outings, including round-trip transportation. Leading big group tours are Brazil Expedition and Be A Local. For something more personalized, independent guide Sergio Manhães takes small groups with him (usually via metro) on game days.For a behind-the-scenes look at the stadium, take a stadium tour with Maracanã Tour, available daily."

Here you'll find a mix of older Leme residents as well as kids from the nearby favelas of Babilônia and Chapeu Mangueira.The beach is lit at night and there are police in the area, but it’s still not wise to walk there after dark – stay near the liveliest beach kiosks when venturing out. Av NS de Copacabana is also sketchy – watch out on weekends, when the shops are closed and there are few locals around."

    "detail_description": "About 6km south of Teresópolis, off the BR-116 Rio–Teresópolis highway, you'll find the main (and most accessible) entrance to magnificent Parque Nacional Serra dos Órgaos, which offers some of Brazil's most dramatic hiking, climbing and mountain scenery. From this point of entry, visitors can access both the park's tamer lower section – perfect for a picnic with its walking trails, waterfalls, natural swimming pools and tended lawns and gardens – and the wilder upper section, with its challenging high country trails.\nFrom the Teresópolis entrance, the road extends into the park as far as Barragem Beija Flor. From here, lower section visitors can continue up the 800m Trilha Mozart Catão (one hour round trip from the park road) up to the Mirante Alexandre Oliveira (1100m) for nice views of Teresópolis – or follow the park's newest trail, the 1.2km Trilha Cartão Postal, up to a higher viewpoint (1320m) for spectacular perspectives on the distinctive Dedo de Deus and the entire Serra dos Órgãos range.There are also several good day hikes for visitors who wish to explore the park's more rugged upper section. The highlight is the Trilha Pedra do Sino – a strenuous roundtrip of about eight hours from the end of the park road (R$52 trail fee). The trail passes Cachoeira Veu da Noiva, the vegetation changes from rainforest to grassland, and the reward is a panoramic view stretching all the way to Rio de Janeiro and the Baía de Guanabara.To reach the park entrance from downtown Teresópolis, take the ‘Soberbo’ bus (R$4). Alternatively, take the more frequent ‘Alto’ bus and get off at the Praçinha do Alto, from where it’s a 10-minute walk south to the park’s main entrance. Both buses can be caught at multiple stops along Teresópolis' main drag, Av Almirante Lúcio Meira. A taxi ride from town to the park entrance costs about R$30."

There are many good times to make the ascent, but sunset on a clear day is the most rewarding. Two cable cars connect to the summit, 395m above Rio. At the top, the city unfolds beneath you, with Corcovado mountain and Cristo Redentor (Christ the Redeemer) off to the west, and Copacabana Beach to the south.\nA visit to Pão de Açúcar is a must, but be prepared for heavy crowds. If possible, go first thing in the morning – and avoid going on cloudy days.The first cable car ascends 215m to Morro da Urca. From here, you can see Baía de Guanabara (Guanabara Bay) and the winding coastline; on the ocean side of the mountain is Praia Vermelha. Morro da Urca has souvenir shops, snack bars, a concert venue (Arena Morro da Urca) and a helipad (helicopter tours are offered by Helisight).The second cable car goes up to Pão de Açúcar. If the breathtaking heights unsteady you, a stylish open-sided bar (Clássico Beach Club) serves tropical cocktails, as well as high-end snacks.The two-stage cable cars depart every 20 minutes.Those who’d rather take the long way to the top should sign up with one of the granite-hugging climbing tours offered by various outfits in Rio. Morro da Urca is much easier to climb, and you can do it on your own. The short but steep path takes about 30 minutes to climb. You’ll find the unmarked trail along the Pista Cláudio Coutinho."
