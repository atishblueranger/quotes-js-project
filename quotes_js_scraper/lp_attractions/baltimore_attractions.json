The whimsical automatons in the Cabaret Mechanical Theater are worth a closer look. And don't miss the famous Flatulence Post and its, er, 'fart art' in the Basement Gallery.\nLeave time to explore the gift store (reportedly described by filmmaker John Waters as “the best museum gift shop you’ve ever been to in your life”) to pick up a souvenir.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nExhibitions\nAs well as a permanent exhibition of intuitive and self-taught art works, the museum hosts temporary exhibitions.\nTickets\nPrebook tickets online with your timed arrival slot. Members and children 6 and under go free.\n&nbsp;\n"

Later the remains of Poe’s wife, Virginia Eliza Clemm Poe who died of tuberculosis two years prior to Poe, were exhumed and buried with him.&nbsp;\nTombstone inscription\nThe tombstone is inscribed with a quotation from “The Raven”, but as with everything about Poe, the placement and content of his tombstone has not been without controversy. Even the engraved birthday on the tombstone is incorrect. Poe was born on January 19, not January 20.\nBut how did Edgar Allan Poe die?\nThere are many theories on what was the cause of Edgar Allan Poe’s death at the age of 40 in October 1849: murder, flu, alcoholicism, mercury poisoning....&nbsp;\nThe official cause listed on his death certificate is phrenitis or swelling of the brain. The reason he was suffering from it, plus the delirium tremors and hallucinations in the days leading up to his passing, remain the source of continued speculation.\n&nbsp;\n"

    "detail_description": "Well worth the 7-mile drive north from the Inner Harbor, this grand 19th-century mansion provides a fascinating glimpse into upper-class Baltimore life of the 1800s. The house is packed with fine art and masterpieces of the decorative arts – including paintings by Modigliani, glass by Louis Comfort Tiffany and exquisite Asian porcelain – not to mention the astounding rare book collection, numbering some 32,000 volumes.&nbsp;\nJohns Hopkins University caretakes this and another historic house museum, the more contemporary Homewood Museum. Both are in Baltimore’s historic Charles Street corridor. Located between the campuses of the Notre Dame of Maryland University and Loyola University Maryland and&nbsp;surrounded by 26 acres of gardens and woods, it is also a popular venue for private weddings.&nbsp;Visits here are by guided tour, offered on the hour until 3pm.\nGarrett family history\nEven more impressive than the collection is the compelling story of the Garrett family. Patriarch John W Garrett was president of the B&amp;O Railroad and he purchased the home in 1878 for his son T Harrison. The Garretts were world travelers – T Harrison's son John W, who inherited the house in 1920, was an active diplomat for some years. They were also astute philanthropists, as well as lovers of the arts, if not always successful performers in their own right – though that didn't stop the younger John W's wife, Alice, from taking the stage (her own, which you'll see in the intimate theater below the house).\n&nbsp;\n"
