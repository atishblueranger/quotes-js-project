The early-19th-century architecture provides a fitting backdrop to his mementoes, drawings and paintings.\nThe house itself was actually the artist's first canvas: the 17-year-old Bukovac painted a series of decorative frescoes on the walls and ceilings which were only uncovered in the late 1990s."
