    "detail_description": "Gramado's stone church on the main square is a favorite photo point with Brazilians.\nIt was built with 78,000 basalt stones pulled by bull carts from nearby quarries and features stained-glass windows marking the life of Peter, based on designs by German artist Peter Dobmeier. There are also 12 life-size statues of the apostles in front of the church. A wooden version of the church was originally consecrated in 1917; it was changed to stone in 1943 after eights years of construction."
