Representing Wright's Prairie House ideal, it consists of six interconnected buildings, each meticulously restored inside and out. Two tour options (book online) offer different levels of detail on this elaborate project.\nVisitors will revel in the intricate details that the Martin family fortune allowed Wright free reign to indulge, including a central fireplace with a wisteria pattern mosaic. For $150, you can book a day-long tour that includes a visit to Graycliff Estate, also designed by Wright."
