Dating from the Kushan era (around AD 500), this is the largest Buddha statue in Central Asia. Other interesting pieces include figures buried with beads from the archaeological site in Sarazm (near Penjikent), bronze mountain goats fashioned as 5th-century BC throne fragments, and some beautiful carved ivory scabbards."

    "detail_description": "Tajikistan's national museum is housed in an impressive modern building with an elliptical roof and giant atrium. The collection encompasses three main sections – natural history, archaeology and contemporary fine arts – and displays include minerals (including a giant mineral tree), dioramas of snow leopards and Marco Polo sheep, suits of armour and musical instruments. Among the most important exhibits are the murals from ancient Penjikent and an exquisite 10th-century wooden mehrab (mosque prayer niche) found near Ayni.\nOther noteworthy parts of the museum's modest collection is a reconstruction of the 7th-century Ajina-Tepe Buddhist monastery (the original reclining Buddha is housed in the National Museum of Antiquities) and an interesting set of gifts to the state, mostly modern, from around the world. Labels include English translations."

The modern complex, built in 2008 to mark the 1150 year anniversary of the 'founder of the Persian language', encompasses a dazzlingly white mausoleum, a library and a bookshop dedicated to the great man.\nThe surrounding garden is home to a 400-year-old mulberry tree and thousands of rose bushes, each with a strong fragrance – a redolent nod to the fact that Rudaki was thought by some to be blind in later life. He spent all his life in Bukhara but returned in 938 to die in Panjrud, the place of his birth. The shrine has become something of a place of pilgrimage and regardless of any interest in Persian poetry, it's impossible to miss an air of reverence that hangs over the lovingly tended site.The complex is 17km south of the main A377, half way between Ayni and Penjikent."

    "detail_description": "Rock faces on the steep slopes above Langar are inscribed with over 6000 ancient petroglyphs. Climbing to see them is hard work in the high altitude and it gets very hot on the unshaded scree slopes, but the effort is rewarded with grand views across the confluence of three rivers. An eroded trail leads further up beyond the rock face (around four hours) to a fine camping spot in Engels Meadows with a rare view of Engels Peak (6510m).\nThere are several sets of petroglyphs on the rock face but there is a clear path towards the most accessible group. The trail starts from Langar school, meanders 400m west, then climbs 200m north from the obvious prayer house. The trail then follows power lines and climbs along the dry stream gully to a graveyard. The last part of the approach involves an ankle-twisting scramble up a scree slope (15 minutes) before crossing a small stream. It has to be said that to the untrained eye it can be hard to tell ancient carvings from more recent copy-cat ibexes and more obvious 20th-century graffiti but this does not diminish the significance of this ancient site.Guides offer to take visitors to a larger, more pristine group of petroglyphs higher up the cliff but without specialist knowledge this doesn't offer much advantage for the considerable extra effort."

    "detail_description": "On a terrace above the banks of River Zerafshan, 1.5km southeast of today's Penjikent, the ruins of a major Sogdian town slowly bake to dust. Looking across the minimal ruins, dubbed the 'Pompeii of Central Asia', it's hard to imagine that from the 5th to 8th centuries this was the site of one of the most cosmopolitan cities on the Silk Road. Thankfully a museum, in a traditional single-room building, brings the former settlement to life with copies of the best finds.\nThe site has been extensively excavated over the years and has yielded several important finds, including the so-called 'Penjikent frescoes'. Depicting hunting scenes, these frescoes would once have adorned a palace with pillars carved in the shape of dancing girls. Part of the original fresco sequence is now on display in the museum in Penjikent, part is exhibited in the National Museum in Dushanbe, while the best portion is in the Hermitage in St Petersburg. A site map outside the museum helps to explain the ruins, or just to wander at random among the sun-baked ridges.To reach the site, drivers of marshrutka 5 will stop about five minutes' walk from 'Stary Penjikent'. On a clear day the mountain panoramas are splendid and from this raised position it's easy to plot a course back to town, descending between the main ruins and the distinct citadel site further west. The route leads down to Beruni, a 15-minute stroll from the bazaar."

With its basement dioramas of prehistoric life, this is Khojand's best museum.\nOther features of the museum include some fine textiles and costumes, a traditional home showcasing Tajiki embroidery and some now rare Tajiki handwoven rugs.The main hall is dominated by a statue of Timur Malik, the local hero who battled the Mongol onslaught from an island in the Syr-Darya, formerly known as the Oxus. The river, which runs past Komil Khojandi Park alongside the citadel, makes for a pleasant post-museum stroll."

The real gems of the collection, though, are the samples of vertically striped silk cloth known as 'atlas' – a fabric still worn by Tajikistani women on special occasions.\nProduced by the country's famous silk and cotton weaving industry, centred on the Qaratog area and traditionally the work of men, atlas fabric is traditionally produced from natural pigments such as cochineal, pomegranate and indigo which combine to create the distinctive and dynamic colour ways of the yarn. Great skill is needed to produce the printed appearance of the finished woven fabric. Sadly, weaving is a dying art in the region largely due to the import of mass produced cloth from China which gives a printed, and much cheaper, imitation of atlas.Photography is not permitted."
