    "detail_description": "Food is the main attraction here − from Thai, Sri Lankan, Indian, Chinese and Malaysian to Brazilian, Greek, Portuguese and more − all at around $6 to $12 a serve. But that's only half the fun – arts and crafts stalls bulge with handmade jewellery, fabulous rainbow tie-dyed clothes, Aboriginal artefacts, and wares from Indonesia and Thailand. Mindil beach is about 2km from Darwin's city centre; it's an easy walk or hop on buses 4 or 6, which go past the market.\nAs the sun heads towards the horizon, half of Darwin descends on the market, with tables, chairs, rugs, grog and kids in tow to enjoy the sunset. Peruse and promenade, stop for a pummelling massage or listen to rhythmic live music. Don't miss a flaming satay stick from Bobby's brazier. Top it off with fresh fruit salad, a decadent cake or luscious crêpes.Similar stalls (you'll recognise many of the stallholders) can be found at various suburban markets from Friday to Sunday."

    "detail_description": "If the tourists won't go out to see the crocs, then bring the crocs to the tourists. Right in the middle of Mitchell St, Crocosaurus Cove is as close as you'll ever want to get to these amazing creatures. Six of the largest crocs in captivity can be seen in state-of-the-art aquariums and pools, while you can be lowered right into a pool with the crocs in the transparent Cage of Death (one/two people $170/260).\nIf that's too scary, there's another pool where you can swim with a clear tank wall separating you from some mildly less menacing baby crocs. Other aquariums feature barramundi, turtles and stingrays, plus there's an enormous reptile house (allegedly displaying the greatest variety of reptiles in the country)."
