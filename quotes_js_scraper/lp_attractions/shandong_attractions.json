The building’s interior is characteristic of Jugendstil, the German arm of art nouveau, with some German and Chinese furnishings of the era. It was built in 1903 at a cost of 2,450,000 taels of silver by an indulgent governor, whom Kaiser Wilhelm II immediately sacked when he saw the bill.\nIn 1957 Chairman Mao stayed here with his wife and kids on holiday. So did defence minister Lin Biao, who would later attempt to assassinate Mao."

Confucius and more than 100,000 of his descendants have been buried here for the past 2000 years, a tradition still ongoing.\nThe great sage's tomb is a simple grass mound enclosed by a low wall and faced with a Ming-dynasty stele. Pairs of stone guardians stand at the ready. His son and grandson are buried nearby, and scattered through the forest are dozens of temples and pavilions.When Confucius died in 479 BC, he was buried on the bank of the Si River beneath a simple marker. In the Western Han dynasty, Emperor Wudi deemed Confucianism the only worthy school of thought, and the Tomb of Confucius (孔子墓, Kǒngzǐ Mù) became a place of pilgrimage.A slow walk through the parklike cemetery can take a couple of hours, though Confucius’ tomb is just a 10-minute walk from the entrance (turn left after the second gateway, called 'Supreme Sage Cemetery Gateway').Electric sightseeing carts (¥20) are on hand to take passengers on a loop of the forest before dropping them back at Confucius' tomb, but you get much more freedom if you explore on foot.The forest is a 15-minute walk from the old town, or take bus 1 (¥1) from Gulou Beijie, or a pedicab (¥10)."

The entrance to the ticketed scenic area is at the south end, and the route up to the pavilion passes the grounds of an ancient naval base and a series of temples. The pavilion itself is unassuming as its restored exterior is rather similar to surrounding structures.\nInside is a collection of prized inscriptions left by famous visitors since the Song dynasty, and a beautiful modern rendering of the Eight Immortals by Zhou Jinyun. There are many versions of the story, but in this one the immortals, who came from different walks of life, shared drinks at the pavilion before crossing the Bo Sea using unique superpowers.Close to the pavilion, and still within the ticketed scenic area, you can zip across the bay by cable car for cliffside walks overlooking the Bo and Yellow Seas. The park also contains museums (open 7.30am to 5.30pm) dedicated to ancient shipbuilding, regional relics and Qi Jiguang, a local-born Ming-dynasty general who battled pirates.If you arrive after a heavy rain, keep an eye out for mirages at sea that have appeared every few years. Long ago, this earned Penglai a reputation as a gateway to immortal lands and compelled Emperor Qin Shi Huang to send ships in search of islands of immortality further east."

The mansion buildings were moved from the temple grounds to the present site in 1377 and vastly expanded into 560 rooms in 1503. More remodelling followed, including reconstruction following a devastating fire in 1885. The mansion was for centuries the most sumptuous private residence in China, thanks to imperial sponsorship and the Kong clan’s rule, which included powers of taxation and execution, over Qufu as an autonomous estate.\nThe clan indulged in 180-course meals, and kept servants and consorts. Male heirs successively held the title of Duke Yan Sheng from the Song dynasty until 1935.Confucius Mansion is built on an ‘interrupted’ north–south axis with administrative offices (taxes, edicts, rites, registration and examination halls) at the entrance (south) and private quarters at the back (north). The Ceremonial Gate (重光门, Chóngguāng Mén) was opened only when emperors dropped in. The central path passes a series of halls, including the Great Hall (大堂, Dà Táng) and Nèizhái Gate (内宅门, Nèizhái Mén), which separated the private and public parts of the residence and was guarded at all times.The large ‘shòu’ character (壽, longevity) presented in traditional Chinese script within the single-eaved Upper Front Chamber (前上房, Qián Shàng Fáng) north of Nèizhái Gate was a gift from Qing Empress Cixi. The Duke lived in the two-storey Front Chamber (前堂楼, Qián Táng Lóu).Just east of Nèizhái Gate is the Tower of Refuge (奎楼, Kuí Lóu), not open to visitors, where the Kong clan could gather if the peasants turned nasty. It has an iron-lined ceiling on the ground floor and a staircase that could be yanked up.There's a pleasant fruit-tree garden at the north end of the complex; you can then leave via the north gate (exit only)."

You may have to share it with the masses – its supernatural allure attracts the Chinese in droves – but a pilgrimage hike to Tai Shan's summit is a unique experience few people forget.\nBixia, the Princess of the Azure Clouds, a Taoist deity whose presence permeates the temples dotted along the route, is a powerful cult figure for the rural women of Shandong and beyond. It's said that if you climb Tai Shan you'll live to 100, and tribes of wiry grandmothers trot up the steps with surprising ease, their target the cluster of temples at the summit where they burn money and incense, praying for their progeny. Sun-worshippers muster wide-eyed on the peak, straining for the first flickers of dawn. In ancient Chinese tradition, it was believed that the sun began its westward journey from Tai Shan.From its heights Confucius uttered the dictum: 'The world is small.' You too can climb up and say, 'I'm knackered.'Avoid coinciding your climb with the public holiday periods held in the first weeks of May and October, otherwise you will share the mountain with what the Chinese call 'rén shān, rén hǎi' (人山人海) – literally a 'mountain of people and a sea of persons.'"

The heart of the complex is the huge yellow-eaved Dacheng Hall (大成殿, Dàchéng Diàn), which in its present form dates from 1724. Craftspeople carved the 10 dragon-coiled columns so expertly that they were covered with red silk when Emperor Qianlong visited, lest he feel that the Forbidden City’s Hall of Supreme Harmony paled in comparison. Inside is a huge statue of Confucius resplendent on a throne.\nAbove him are the characters 萬世師表 (wànshì shībiǎo), meaning ‘model teacher for all ages’.The temple has nine courtyards arranged on a central axis. China’s largest imperial building complex after the Forbidden City began as Confucius’ three-room house, but after his death in 478 BC the Duke of the Lu (鲁, Lǔ) state consecrated his simple abode as a temple. Everything in it, including his clothing, books, musical instruments and a carriage, was perfectly preserved. The house was rebuilt for the first time in AD 153, kicking off a series of expansions and renovations in subsequent centuries. By 1012 it had four courtyards and over 300 rooms. An imperial-palace-style wall was added. After a fire in 1499, it was rebuilt to its present scale.Over 1000 stelae documenting imperial gifts and sacrifices from the Han dynasty onwards, as well as treasured examples of calligraphy and stone reliefs, are preserved on the grounds. Look for a bìxì bearing the Cheng Hua stele (成化碑, Chénghuà bēi), dedicated by the Ming emperor in 1468, which praises Confucius in a particularly bold, formal hand. The characters are so perfect that copies were used to teach penmanship. The Shengji Hall (圣迹殿, Shèngjī Diàn) houses 120 famed Tang-dynasty paintings depicting Confucius’ life immortalised as carvings.Halfway through the complex rises the triple-eaved Great Pavilion of the Constellation of Scholars (奎文阁, Kuíwén Gé), an imposing Song-dynasty wooden structure. A series of gates and colossal, twin-eaved stele pavilions lead to the Apricot Altar (杏坛, Xìng Tán), which marks the spot where Confucius taught his students under an apricot tree.South of Chongsheng Hall (崇圣祠, Chóngshèng Cí), which was once the site of the original family temple, the Lu Wall (鲁壁, Lǔ Bì) stands where Confucius’ ninth-generation descendant hid Confucius’ writings in the walls of his house during Emperor Qin Shi Huang’s book-burning campaign around 213 BC. The texts were uncovered during an attempt to raze the grounds in 154 BC, spurring new schools of Confucian scholarship and long debates over what Confucius really said."

Beyond this and the Zhengyang gate is the Yaocan Pavilion.Between the buildings, the courtyards are filled with prized examples of poetry and imperial records. Fossilised-looking bìxì (the mythical tortoise son of the dragon), dating from the 12th century onwards, carry stelae on their backs documenting everything from the civil exam process to emperors’ birthdays. The Han Emperor Wudi himself is said to have planted some of the massive, twisting trees in the Cypress Tree Pavilion 2100 years ago.The main hall is the colossal Hall of Heavenly Blessing, which dates from AD 1009, and whose dark interior houses an exquisite, 62m-long Song-dynasty mural depicting a journey undertaken by Emperor Zhenzong as the Lord of Tai Shan, the god of longevity to whom the entire complex is dedicated."
