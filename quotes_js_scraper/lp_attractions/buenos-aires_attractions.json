There’s a small museum dedicated to the cathedral’s history. For Pope Francis souvenirs, visit the small gift shop near the entrance.\nThe cathedral is also a national historical site that contains the mausoleum of General José de San Martín, Argentina’s most revered hero, who led the country to independence in 1816. In the chaos that followed, San Martín chose exile in France, never again returning to Argentina; his remains were brought to Buenos Aires in 1880, 30 years after his death. Outside the cathedral you’ll see a flame keeping his spirit alive."

On the first floor is the quirky Museo del Agua y de la Historia Sanitaria with a collection of ornate tiles, faucets, ceramic pipe joints and old toilets.\nTopped by French-style mansard roofs, the building's facade consists of 170,000 glazed tiles and 130,000 enameled bricks, all shipped from Europe and assembled here. It still houses the offices of Argentina's state water company AySA, whose customers come here to pay their utility bills. Guided visits offer a backstage glimpse of the building’s inner workings."

The curved ceiling in the main salon is beautifully painted, and there’s also a peaceful garden. Signage is in Spanish.\nAlso known as the Palacio Noel, after the designing architect, the museum building and its collections suffered damage (since repaired) from the 1992 bombing of the Israeli embassy, which at the time was located at Arroyo and Suipacha. The space where the embassy was located has since become a small memorial park; you can still see the outline of the building on a neighboring wall."

The park’s most prominent monument is an equestrian statue of José de San Martín; visiting dignitaries often come to honor the country’s liberator by leaving wreaths at its base. On the downhill side of the park you’ll see the Monumento a los Caídos de Malvinas, a memorial to the young men who died in the Falklands War.\nRetiro was the site of a monastery during the 17th century, and later became the country retiro (retreat) of Agustín de Robles, a Spanish governor. Since then, Plaza San Martín – which sits on a bluff – has played host to a slave market, a military fort and even a bullring.At the southern end of the plaza is Estación Retiro (Retiro train station), built by the British in 1915."

(Unfortunately for the Jesuits, they were later expelled from the premises – and Argentina – in 1767 by the King of Spain.) Along with housing offices, these buildings hosted converted indigenous people from the provinces. Later, during the 19th century, they were home to various museums, legislative offices, schools and universities.Today, a cultural center on the premises offers workshops and music, film and theater events, and a wonderfully atmospheric milonga takes place in here on Friday nights."

The interesting Museo Casa Rosada is located behind the palace.One theory goes that the Casa Rosada's pink hue represented President Sarmiento's attempts to make peace during his 1868–74 term (by blending the red of the Federalists with the white of the Unitarians), but the more likely explanation is that it was caused by mixing white paint with bovine blood, a common practice in the late 19th century."

Within the vast beaux-arts structure – which stands eight stories tall and takes up an entire city block – are multiple art galleries and events spaces. The highlight is the Ballena Azul, a concert hall with world-class acoustics.\nThe original building, which was modeled on New York City’s main post office, took nearly 30 years to complete – it was finished in 1928. Restoration for the cultural center began in 2009 and it opened in May 2015. The architects used glass and stainless steel to maintain and add to the beauty of the original structure.The result is one of the city's grandest buildings, and it’s well worth a visit. It's free to enter and there are usually exhibitions to see that don't require tickets as well as a range of activities, like yoga, dance classes and concerts, that are free but ticketed. There's also great free programming and activity areas for kids. Check the website to see what's on and act quickly if you want to book."

Its structure is divided into hell, purgatory and heaven; its height (100m) is a reference to each canto (song); and the number of floors (22) mirrors the number of verses per song. Dreamt up by the Italian architect Mario Palanti, Palacio Barolo was the tallest skyscraper in South America when it was completed in 1923.\nYou can walk around the gorgeous lobby for free, but it's best to go on a guided tour of the building: you'll get to ride in a vintage 1920s elevator and admire the panoramic views from the rooftop lighthouse. Palacio Barolo Tours offers a wide range of bilingual tours, including thematic tours focusing on architecture, literature, or photography, and nighttime tours that include a wine tasting. See the website for more details or stop at the kiosk on the building's ground level to book a tour.Note that there's also a new cocktail bar and cafe, Salón 1923, on the 16th floor of Palacio Barolo: the indoor-outdoor space is a wonderful venue for a coffee or a glass of wine, especially around sunset. It's also a (free) way to get a glimpse of the wonderful views from the building's upper levels without paying for a tour."
