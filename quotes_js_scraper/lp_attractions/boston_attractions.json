    "detail_description": "The city’s second-oldest cemetery – dating from 1660 – is the final resting place for an estimated 10,000 souls. It is named for William Copp, who originally owned this land. While the oldest graves belong to Copp's children, there are several other noteworthy residents.\nNear the Charter St gate you'll find the graves of the Mather family – Increase, Cotton and Samuel – all of whom were politically powerful religious leaders in the colonial community. Front and center is the grave of Daniel Malcolm, whose headstone commemorates his rebel activism. British soldiers apparently took offense at this claim and used the headstone for target practice. Also buried on the small plot of land are more than a thousand free African Americans, many of whom lived in the North End."

    "detail_description": "In the 19th century, this historic house was leased to a bookseller, Carter &amp; Hendlee. This was the first of nine bookstores and publishing companies that would occupy the spot, making it a breeding ground for literary and philosophical ideas. The most illustrious was Ticknor &amp; Fields, publisher of books by Thoreau, Emerson, Hawthorne, Longfellow and Harriet Beecher Stowe.\nIn the earliest days of Boston history, this was the site of the home of Anne Hutchinson, the religious dissident who was expelled from the Massachusetts Bay Colony and co-founded the Rhode Island Colony. The current brick building dates to 1718, when it served as a pharmacy and residence. Today the storefront houses a fast-food restaurant, which seems somewhat less lofty than its earlier incarnations."

    "detail_description": "Directly in front of the Old State House, encircled by cobblestones, a bronze plaque marks the spot where the first blood was shed for the American independence movement. On March 5, 1770, an angry mob of colonists swarmed the British soldiers guarding the State House, hurling snowballs, rocks and insults. Thus provoked, the soldiers fired into the crowd and killed five townspeople, including Crispus Attucks, a former slave. The incident sparked enormous anti-British sentiment.\nPaul Revere helped fan the flames by widely disseminating an engraving that depicted the scene as an unmitigated slaughter. Interestingly, John Adams and Josiah Quincy – both of whom opposed the heavy-handed authoritarian British rule – defended the accused soldiers in court, and seven of the nine were acquitted."

The Old South congregation moved to a new building in Back Bay in 1875, when Ralph Waldo Emerson and Julia Ward Howe gathered support to convert the church into a museum."

The plaza hosts food trucks, public gatherings and occasional summertime performances.\nDesigned by IM Pei, City Hall Plaza is home to the fortress-like Boston City Hall and the twin towers of the John F Kennedy Federal Building. The plaza’s high points are the gracefully curved brick Sears Crescent, one of the few buildings that remains from the Scollay Sq days, and the sweeping curve of the modern Center Plaza, which mirrors Sears Crescent."

Besides the biweekly services, recitals are held here every week (12:15pm Tuesday).\nThe church was built on a corner of the city cemetery because the Puritans refused to allow the Anglicans to use any other land. As a result, these are some of the city’s oldest headstones, including one that dates to 1658. Famous graves include John Winthrop, the first governor of the fledgling Massachusetts Bay Colony; William Dawes, who rode with Paul Revere; and Mary Chilton, the first European woman to set foot in Plymouth.In addition to the self-guided tour, visitors are invited on the Bells &amp; Bones tour, which ascends into the bell tower to admire Paul Revere’s work and descends into the crypt to wander among 250-year-old remains."

You can hear about the building’s history from National Park Service (NPS) rangers in the historic hall on the 2nd floor.\nThe brick colonial building – topped with the beloved grasshopper weather vane – was constructed in 1740 at the urging of Boston benefactor and merchant Peter Faneuil. In 1805 Charles Bulfinch enlarged the building, enclosing the 1st-floor market and designing the 2nd-floor meeting space, where public ceremonies are still held today. On the top floor the Ancient &amp; Honorable Artillery Co of Massachusetts, which was chartered in 1638, maintains a peculiar collection of antique firearms, political mementos and curious artifacts."

Today’s steeple is a 1954 replica, since severe weather toppled two prior ones, but the 1740 weather vane is original. All visitors are invited to hear a 10-minute presentation about the history of the Old North Church. For more detailed information, a 30-minute Behind the Scenes tour takes visitors up into the belfry and down into the crypt, while the Bones &amp; Burials tour visits the gallery, the crypt and Copp's Hill Burying Ground.Behind the church, several hidden brick courtyards offer quiet respite for a moment of peaceful meditation. Heading down the hill, shady Paul Revere Mall perfectly frames the Old North Church. Often called ‘the Prado’ by locals, it is a lively meeting place for North Enders of all generations."

    "detail_description": "Teeming with sea creatures of all sizes, shapes and colors, this giant fishbowl is the centerpiece of downtown Boston's waterfront. There are countless exhibits here exploring the lives and habitats of underwater oddities, as well as penguins and marine mammals. Here are some of the highlights.\nGiant Ocean Tank\nThe main attraction at the aquarium is the four-story Giant Ocean Tank, which swirls with thousands of tropical creatures great and small, including turtles, sharks and eels. The vast tank holds 200,000 gallons of water, and is so huge that the rest of the aquarium was built around it.\nSeals and sea lions\nHarbor seals hang out in an observation tank near the aquarium entrance, while the open-air Marine Mammal Center is home to northern fur seals and California sea lions. Visitors can watch training sessions where the pinnipeds show off their intelligence and athleticism. Note that some animal rights groups make a strong case that marine mammals should not be kept in captivity, no matter how classy their quarters.\n\n  \nThe penguin colony is home to over 60 birds © Jessica Bethke / Shutterstock\n\nPenguins\nMost of the aquarium's 1st floor is dedicated to an enormous penguin colony, home to more than 60 birds representing two different species: rockhoppers and African (or jackass) penguins. \nShark and Ray Touch Tank\nThe Shark and Ray Touch Tank recreates a mangrove swamp full of Atlantic rays, cownose rays and five species of sharks. Currently it's open for viewing only (no touching), but you can still learn about the importance of protecting ocean habitats and see plenty of activity through the crystal-clear water.\nAmazon Rainforest\nUpstairs, six different tanks showcase the flora and fauna of the Amazon rain forest, one of the most diverse habitats in the world. Look out for poison dart frogs, piranhas and anacondas.\nOlympic Coast exhibit\nEver wanted to see a giant Pacific octopus, the largest of its species? This is where you could spot them, stretching their tentacles among other Pacific ocean creatures, including sea cucumbers, hermit crabs, and many different types of fish. \n\n  \nChildren under 3 can enter the aquarium for free © Tim Laman / Getty Images\n\nSimons Theatre\nThe Simons Theatre features short films with aquatic themes. Follow a pod of humpback whales on their migration, or get to know more about the incredible hunting skills of great white sharks. Closed captioning devices are available for all films.\nWhale watching \nThe whale-watching cruises run by the aquarium in partnership with Boston Harbor Cruises (March to November) head out to Stellwagen Bank where whale sightings are guaranteed. You may also see sea birds, dolphins and other marine life.\nTickets and other practicalities\nTimed-tickets to the aquarium should be bought online in advance. There is an additional charge for screenings at the Simons Theatre. Children under 3 may visit for free. Wheelchair-users may enter the aquarium free of charge. Whale-watching tickets should be booked through Boston Harbor Cruises, and can be combined with entry to the aquarium at a small discount.\n"
