Within the fort grounds is an oasis of lovely manicured gardens, plazas and fountains leading to an arched gate and a pretty lily pond. Within is the beautifully presented Rizal Shrine museum, the building where Dr José Rizal – the Philippines’ national hero – was incarcerated as he awaited execution in 1896. It contains various fascinating displays of Rizal memorabilia and a recreation of his cell and the courtroom trial.\nAt the far end of the fort are outlooks over an industrial section of the Pasig River leading to Baluarte de Santa Barbara, a restored 18th-century Spanish military barracks where hundreds of Filipino and American POWs were killed in WWII; it's now the Rizaliana Furniture Hall, displaying Rizal's family furniture. Also of interest are various dungeon cell blocks, including one that Rizal spent his last night in. Brass footprints set into the pavement mark his final steps to the execution spot in Rizal Park."

It's a unique set-up, with many mausoleums doubling as houses, small shops and game arcades for kids.\nDespite the government considering the inhabitants to be squatters (issuing eviction notices on several occasions), many of the North Cemetery dwellers have jobs within, including being employed by tomb owners to provide maintenance duties and keep their deceased company.Given the community is extremely impoverished, it's essential to come along with a guide who knows the area, either arranged through nearby Red Carabao hostel, Smokey Tours or at the cemetery entrance (though with the latter you're not guaranteed an English speaker)."

It's managed by the Government Service Insurance System (GSIS; www.gsis.gov.ph). Contact GSIS' Danny Martinez a few days in advance to schedule a free tour.\nThe Coconut Palace was unquestionably one of Imelda's wackiest schemes (and that's saying something). Hearing that Pope John Paul II was planning a visit to his flock in the Philippines, Imelda ordered that a grand palace be built. Huge teams of craftspeople laboured overtime to complete this edifice in time for the pontiff’s arrival. As Imelda readied herself to throw open the door to welcome the pope, she got stiffed. After sternly chastising that the US$37 million cost could have gone to better uses, such as clean water for the people, the pope went elsewhere.Imelda eventually seized upon a couple of C-level celebrities for a gala opening: Brooke Shields and George Hamilton. As camp goes, you can’t do much better. It is rumoured that Brooke got pineapple-fibre sheets for her room, while the ever-tanned George snuggled into banana-fibre sheets."

    "detail_description": "Perched overlooking the Pasig River, this sprawling palace complex dates to the mid-18th century, when it was built as the residence of a Spanish aristocrat before becoming the office of the Spanish and, later, American governors-general. It's been the official residence of the Philippine president since 1935. Only the Museo ng Malacañang is open to tourists, and it's highly recommended for anyone who's interested in both political history and colonial architecture.\nThe museum features fascinating displays of memorabilia relating to the 16 Philippines’ presidents since 1899. Highlights include president Quezon's office, the room dedicated to the First Ladies, and Ferdinand Marcos' original 20-page decree proclaiming martial law (it was here in 1986 that the palace grounds were stormed during the People Power Revolution that overthrew the Marcos' government). The building itself is magnificent with gleaming polished floorboards, high ceilings, sparkling chandeliers, ornate wood panelling and capiz windows.To visit you'll need to book five business days in advance – which can be done by simply emailing the museum with your contact number, how many people are in your party and attached photocopies of all passports. Otherwise book a tour through Old Manila Walks, which can arrange everything and combine a palace visit with an excellent walking tour of the area."

    "detail_description": "Still widely known as 'Luneta' (its name until the 1950s), Manila’s iconic central park is spread out over some 60 hectares of open lawns, ornamental gardens, ponds, paved walks and wooded areas, dotted with monuments to a whole pantheon of Filipino heroes. As the place where José Rizal was executed by the Spanish colonial authorities, it's also of great historical significance. The Rizal Park Visitors Centre provides a map detailing some 40 sights within the park.\nRizal Park an atmospheric place to take a stroll, particularly late afternoon, early evening and on weekends. Here you'll find the Rizal Monument, fronted by a 46m flagpole and guarded by sentries in full regalia, which contains the hero’s mortal remains and stands as a symbol of Filipino nationhood.To one side of the monument you will find the Site of Rizal's Execution; at the entrance is a black granite wall inscribed with Rizal’s ‘Mi Ultimo Adios’ (My Last Farewell). Eight tableaux of life-size bronze statues recreate the dramatic last moments of the hero’s life. Evening light-and-sound presentations dedicated to Rizal usually take place here but are suspended indefinitely. When happening, they last 30 minutes and run every evening in both English and Tagalog.On the other (south) side of the monument, toward Kalaw Ave, keep an eye out for the drinking fountain shipped all the way from Heidelberg, Germany, where Rizal spent time studying at university.In the middle of the park is the Central Lagoon, a pool lined with busts of Filipino heroes and martyrs, and a dancing musical fountain that erupts in colourful explosions in the evening. Just north of the lagoon is the open-air auditorium, where the long-running (and free) classical Concert at the Park kicks off at 6pm on Sundays. There's a free Filipino rock concert here at the same time every Saturday night, while Friday nights see theatrical productions. The visitors centre has information on performances.East of the auditorium are several ornamental gardens and the Chess Plaza, a shady spot where regulars test each other and look for new blood with shouts to visitors of ‘Hey Joe, do you play chess?’. At dawn, you'll find various groups gathered to practise t’ai chi or the local martial art of arnis, also know as arnis de mano, a pre-Hispanic style of stick-fighting.At the east end of the park, where the National Museum is located, you'll find a large statue of Lapu-Lapu, a 16th-century national hero famous for slaying the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan; the flower-fillled Manila Orchidarium; and a gigantic three-dimensional relief map of the Philippines."

Those were lean times, so the Spanish priest Padre Diego Cera instructed that bamboo be used instead of more expensive metal for the majority of the organ's pipes. The horizontal trumpets are, however, made of metal. Tours of the church include a short organ concert and entrance to a small museum on-site.\nFor a longer free concert, show up for the 6pm Mass on Sunday. In late February, organists from around the world gather here for the Bamboo Organ Festival.Have a stroll around Las Piñas while you're down here. The area around the church has a bit of a village atmosphere, with many buildings restored using traditional methods. To get here take a Baclaran–Zapote–Alabang jeepney from the Baclaran LRT stop and have the driver drop you off at the church."
