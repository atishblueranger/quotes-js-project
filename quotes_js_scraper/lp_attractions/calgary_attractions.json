From downtown, take bus 3 via Elbow Dr."

It's finished off nicely at its (main) southwest entrance by a huge mesh sculpture of a human head, called Wonderland, by Spanish artist Jaume Plensa."

You'll also find the upscale River Island restaurant here.\nWatch yourself around the river. The water is cold and the current is strong and not suitable for swimming. The bridge to the island from downtown is at the north end of 3rd St SW, near the Eau Claire Market shopping area."
