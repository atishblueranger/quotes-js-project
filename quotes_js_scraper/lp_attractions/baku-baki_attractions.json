    "detail_description": "Well-presented exhibits on Azerbaijan’s history and culture might miss the odd century here and there, but there’s more than enough to fill several hours if you’re really interested. If not, it’s still worth a brief trot through to admire the opulent 1895–1901 mansion of HZ Tağiyev, one of Baku’s greatest late-19th-century oil barons.\nDon't miss the dazzling neo-Moorish ‘Oriental Hall’ and Tağiyev's rebuilt art-nouveau bedroom. Entry is free for university students on the first Wednesday of the month."

Upstairs, some earlier 20th-century canvases also appear, along with three original Picassos, a Dalí and a Chagal.\nEastbound buses 1 and 2 from the train station stop directly across a thundering 12-lane road from the gallery. To find the returning buses, however, you'll need to walk two blocks north."

Possibly millennia old, its construction date is the subject of much debate, though much of the present structure appears to be 12th century. The Azeri name, Qız Qalası, is usually rendered ‘Maiden’s Tower’ in English, leading to plenty of patently fictitious fairy tales. Various versions are considered in the imaginative little multimedia installations that adorn several floors of the tower's interior.\nA better translation of Qız Qalası would be ‘Virgin Tower’, alluding to military impenetrability rather than any association with tragic females. It was certainly an incredibly massive structure for its era, with walls 5m thick at the base and an unusual projecting spine-buttress."
