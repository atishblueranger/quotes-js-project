    "detail_description": "Melbourne's most-celebrated laneway for street art, Hosier Lane's cobbled length draws camera-wielding crowds to its colorful canvas of graffiti, stencils and art installations. The changing subject matter runs from political to countercultural, spiced with irreverent humour. \nThe street art continues along Rutledge Lane, which horseshoes back around to Hosier Lane. As the artworks evolve, with fresh murals continually thrown up overnight (officially most of this is actually illegal), no two visits will be the same. \nYou'll visit Hosier Lane, as well as many other street art-laden lanes nearby including AC/DC Lane, on walking tours of the city centre.\nHosier Lane street art\nMany famous Australian and international artists’ works have been spotted in Hosier Lane since it was first made famous in the global street art scene in the 1990s. The most well-known a Banksy stencil piece, Parachuting Rat from 2003, was mistakenly painted over by city council workers in 2010. \nOther renowned artists to have graced the lane with their ephemeral works include ABOVE (USA), Shepard Fairey (USA), Invader (France), and D*FACE (GB), as well as local talents such as Ha Ha, Prism and Rone. \n\n  \nNight view of colorful graffiti artwork at Hosier Lane in Melbourne ©Javen/Shutterstock\n\nHosier Lane history\nMelbourne's street artists first took their lead from the graffiti scene in New York, with train carriages and railway tracks the focus in the 1980s, before Melbourne's dark and disused city laneways became the new canvas for creatives. Over time stencil art, ‘pasties’ and sculptures complemented tags and pieces spray-painted after hours.\nSmall bars and restaurants began popping up off the main city thoroughfares. Soon the city embraced this new vibrancy and the attention from overseas visitors to Melbourne. Many private and public walls now have large-scale murals painted on commission across Melbourne. Hosier Lane is just the beginning of your street art odyssey. To learn more about Melbourne’s early underground street art scene, seek out the 2005 documentary RASH. \nIn 2020, ten masked men spray painted Hosier Lane with fire extinguishers filled with brightly colored paint, an act of vandalism according to the police and Lord Mayor. It was unclear if this was a response to the commercialization of Hosier Lane’s street art, or just a boring contribution to its story, but the bluestone cobbled lane was quickly cleaned up and new artworks appeared almost immediately. \nHosier Lane directions\nThe lane is directly opposite Federation Square (‘Fed Square’ to locals) off Flinders Street, at the southern end of Melbourne’s main city centre. Fed Square also houses two major cultural hubs: ACMI, the museum of screen culture, and the Ian Potter Centre: NGV Australia.\nAnother major landmark to look out for is the 1920s-built Forum theatre, originally a picture palace and now a major live music venue. \nHosier Lane bars and restaurants \nA Melbourne institution, the Spanish tapas restaurant MoVida sits as the southern end of Hosier Lane. While newcomer Tres a Cinco, a colorful Mexican cantina selling tacos and tequila, replaced the long-standing Misty cocktail bar.\n \n"

He bought the site in 2018 with the aim of beautifying the once-fearsome Pentonville-style prison into his latest canvas.\nDespite the reimagining of this formidable space as a modern art gallery, featuring the vibrant work of both Bromley and his contemporaries, you'll still get a sense of its creepy history, with the old cells, gallows and watchtowers, and tales of its executions and notable inmates.There are plans to open a cafe and outdoor shipping-container bar to take in the wonderful views of town."

Run by five Koorie communities (including the Jardwadjali and Djab Wurrung people, the traditional custodians of the region) in conjunction with Parks Victoria, the centre offers insights into local culture and history through traditional stories, art, music, dance, weapons, tools and photographs.\nThe striking building combines timeless Aboriginal motifs with contemporary design and construction materials. Its flowing orange roof represents the open wings of a cockatoo and references the peaks of the Grampians.The Gariwerd Dreaming Theatre (tickets $5/3/15 per adult/child/family) shows two 15-minute films explaining Dreaming stories of Gariwerd (the region's original name) and the creation story of Bunjil. The ceiling here represents the southern right whale (totem of the Gunditjmara people). There’s an art room where kids can try their hand at Indigenous painting (from $10), boomerang throwing and didgeridoo playing, among various holiday programs. Native species used for food and medicine are planted outside.Also offered are trips to nearby Aboriginal rock-art sites (from $80/50 per adult/child), which take in other significant sites along the way.The centre has an important section on Aboriginal political issues experienced since colonial times, including sobering coverage of the massacres of Indigenous people that took place across the state.In a separate building – where you first enter the complex – are a souvenir shop and interesting educational displays covering the natural features and history of the Grampians; staff can advise on walks and sell camping permits. The bush-tucker cafe has a lovely deck overlooking the gardens."

    "detail_description": "Commanding expansive ocean views, this windswept national park on the peninsula’s western tip was a seasonal base of its traditional owners, the Boon Wurrung people. After colonisation, a Quarantine Station was established here in 1852. Fort Nepean, which played an important role in defending Australia from military threat, was built in stages from the late 1870s. Original gun emplacements remain there, as do the 50-odd heritage buildings that made up the Quarantine Station.\nThere are a number of scenic walking and cycling trails in the park; gnarled Moonah trees (Melaleuca lanceolata) bent by the strong winds dot most of the landscape and local fauna including echidnas and wallabies can be spotted. Coles Track links the Quarantine Station with Gunners Cottage and Fort Nepean. En route keep an eye out for the Harold Holt memorial, the site where Australia's former prime minister remarkably disappeared here after a swim in December 1967.The visitor centre in the Quarantine Station offers walking maps, or hire a bike (per three hours standard/electric bike $19.40/43.70) – they book out, so arrive early to avoid disappointment. Audio tours of Fort Nepean, the Quarantine Station and the park can be downloaded from the Parks Victoria website or the iTunes Store.There is a large car park at the Quarantine Station. To get to the fort you can park at Gunners Cottage, from where it's a 2.6km walk or bicycle ride. Alternatively a hop-on/hop-off wheelchair-accessible shuttle bus travels between the quarantine station and the fort (adult/child return $12/8) operating every 30 minutes between 10.30am and 4pm. This connects with the Portsea public bus stop (bus 788 to/from Frankston) three times daily; check the Parks Victoria website for details."

A range of tours run from the Visitor Centre, from straight-up heritage tours to Ghostyard Paranormal and Convict Escape Attempts (from $16). The island's a major venue for the Biennale.\nA spooky tunnel passes clear through the middle of the island and you can also explore the remains of the prison. During WWII most of the old sandstone buildings were stripped of their roofs and converted into bomb shelters. Solitary confinement cells were unearthed here after being filled in and forgotten in the 1890s."

The play between the pale sandy riverbeds, the red and purple gorge walls, the white tree trunks, the eucalyptus-green foliage and the blue sky is spectacular. Depending on the time of year, you'll also find deep swimming holes and abundant wildlife. There's a rangers station and campground with barbecues, water and toilets.\nThe Trephina Gorge Walk (one hour, 2km, marked with orange arrows) loops around the gorge's rim. The Ridgetop Walk (five hours, 9km one way, blue arrows) traverses the ridges from the gorge to John Hayes Rockhole; the 8km return along the road takes about two hours. Along the way, birders will want to watch for the yellow-throated miner, dusky grasswren and even budgerigars. Other hiking possibilities include the Panorama Walk (one hour, 2.5km, red arrows).The delightful John Hayes Rockhole, 9km from the Trephina Gorge turn-off (the last 4km is high-clearance 4WD only), has three basic campsites. From here, the gorgeous Chain of Ponds walk (1½ hours, 4km loop) leads past rock pools and up to a lookout above the gorge.Note that a couple of elderly tourists died after getting lost while hiking here in February 2017, after a sign was washed away by heavy rain – always stick to marked trails, and carry sufficient water at all times.The road in off the Ross Hwy is sealed for the first 3.5km, then turns to gravel, with some (usually shallow) water crossings to the gorge car park. On your way to the gorge, take the turn-off signed 'Ghost Gum'. Just 300m off the main track, you'll find what is believed to be Australia's largest ghost gum, which may be 300 years old and hence predates European settlement in Australia. It's a magnificent specimen."

The star attractions are Streets Beach, an artificial, lagoon-style swimming beach (packed on weekends); and the near-60m-high Wheel of Brisbane, delivering 360-degree views of town.\nAlso in the parklands is Stanley St Plaza, a renovated section of historic Stanley St lined with mainstream cafes, restaurants, a handful of shops and a bustling pub. On Friday night, Saturday and Sunday, the plaza hosts the tourist-heavy Collective Markets South Bank, peddling everything from artisan leather wallets and breezy summer frocks to prints, skincare and contemporary handmade jewellery.Close by, South Bank Piazza is an outdoor performance space offering year-round events."

    "detail_description": "This Australian national art collection is showcased in an impressive purpose-built gallery within the parliamentary precinct. You can justifiably bypass the ticketed exhibitions as almost every big name you could think of from Australian and international art, past and present, is represented in the permanent collection. Famous works include Blue Poles by Jackson Pollock, one of Monet's Waterlilies, a Hockney Diver, several of Sidney Nolan's Ned Kelly paintings, Salvador Dali's Lobster Telephone, an Andy Warhol Elvis print and a triptych by Francis Bacon.\nHighlights include the extraordinary Aboriginal Memorial from Central Arnhem Land in the lobby, created for Australia's 1988 bicentenary. The work of 43 artists, this 'forest of souls' presents 200 hollow log coffins (one for every year of European settlement) and is part of an excellent collection of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art. Most of the Australian art is on the 1st floor, alongside a fine collection of Asian and Pacific art. The outdoor sculpture garden offers a dramatic site for repose. A children's program runs on weekends and school holidays.Free guided tours are offered hourly from 10.30am to 2.30pm."

    "detail_description": "Established in 1862, this compact zoo remains one of the city’s most popular attractions and continues to innovate, having become the world's first carbon-neutral zoo. Set in prettily landscaped gardens, the enclosures aim to simulate the animals’ natural habitats and give them the option to hide if they want to (the gorillas and tigers are particularly good at playing hard to get).\nThere’s a large collection of native animals in natural bush settings, a platypus aquarium, fur seals, plenty of reptiles and an entire faux–Southeast Asian jungle village built around the elephant enclosures. In some cases walkways pass through the enclosures: you can stroll through some of the aviaries and enter a tropical hothouse filled with colourful butterflies. See if you can pass through Lemur Island without an internal soundtrack of 'I like to move it, move it' turning over in your mind.Running from late January to early March, the yearly Zoo Twilights feature performances by big names and indie talent. Past years included The Presets, Hanson and Rufus Wainwright. From September to May Roar ‘n’ Snore (adult/child from $205/150) allows you to camp at the zoo and join the keepers on their morning feeding rounds."

    "detail_description": "This picturesque row of three- and four-storey sandstone warehouses is a classic example of Australian colonial architecture. Dating back to the whaling days of the 1830s, Salamanca Pl was then the waterfront – goods were winched from the upper levels of the warehouses directly onto ships. By the mid-20th century many of the warehouses had fallen into ruin, before restorations began in the 1970s. These days Salamanca hosts myriad restaurants, cafes, bars and shops, and the unmissable Saturday Salamanca Market.\nBehind the warehouses, Salamanca Sq fills an old quarry, while at the eastern end of Salamanca Pl, the conversion of four old wheat silos into plush apartments has also been a hit.Operating behind the scenes is a vibrant and creative arts community. The nonprofit Salamanca Arts Centre occupies seven Salamanca warehouses, home to around 60 arts organisations and individuals, including shops, galleries, studios, performing-arts venues and versatile public spaces. Check the website for happenings.To reach Salamanca from Battery Point, descend the weathered 1840 Kelly’s Steps, wedged between warehouses just east of Salamanca Sq."

Technically not subterranean (they were formed by water working on the limestone of an ancient reef, thrust upward by tectonic pressure) they contain cave coral, stalactites, dangling fig-tree roots and little insectivorous bats. The most popular (one-hour) tour showcases their remarkable acoustics with a classical-music recording in Cathedral Cave, and is suitable for all ages and most fitness levels.\nThe cathedral has become a popular wedding spot, and hosts several concerts throughout the year. In December, around the summer solstice (1 December to 14 January), sunlight beams through a 14m vertical shaft into Belfry Cave, creating an electrifying light show. If you stand directly below the beam, reflected sunlight colours the whole cavern with whatever colour you’re wearing.There are other tours that focus on palaeontology and fossils. Also, daring spelunkers over 16 years old and of decent fitness can book a two-hour ‘adventure tour’ ($90), which has you crawling through tight spots with names such as ‘Fat Man’s Misery’. A less strenuous family version of this tour is also offered (adult/child $50/40; also two hours long).The Capricorn Caves complex has barbecue areas, a pool, a kiosk and accommodation (powered sites $35, cabins from $150)."

It’s also home to Picasso’s Weeping Woman, which was the victim of an art heist in 1986 to protest the lack of state art funding. The 1st floor is given over to Asian art, with exquisite pieces from China, Japan and Southeast Asia. The gallery also has an excellent decorative arts and furniture collection, which is showcased alongside contemporaneous paintings rather than being quarantined in its own section.Designed by architect Sir Roy Grounds, the NGV building was controversial when it was completed in 1967 but has come to be respected as a modernist masterpiece. Make sure you wander through the foyer to the Great Hall, with its extraordinary stained-glass ceiling (lying on the floor to the side is recommended), and continue out onto the sculpture lawn.Keep an eye on the website for NGV Friday Nights, a series of fun-filled ticketed events featuring music, bars, dining and late-night access to feature exhibitions.The NGV's Australian art collection is on display at the Ian Potter Centre at nearby Federation Sq."

Built to commemorate 'the war to end all wars', it opened its doors in 1941 when the next world war was already well underway. Each section depicts Australia's involvement in significant conflicts, including telling displays on recent battles in Afghanistan and Iraq. Attached to the memorial is a large, exceptionally well-designed museum devoted to the nation's military history. Try to time your visit for the Last Post and accompanying ceremony each day just before closing.\nThe entrance opens onto a commemorative courtyard, which encloses a pool of remembrance where an eternal flame burns. The walls of the surrounding cloister are engraved with the names of Australia's war dead. A Last Post ceremony is held here every evening at 4.55pm, just before the doors are shut for the night. Behind the courtyard is the Byzantine-influenced Hall of Memory, a spectacular space topped with a dome and encrusted with mosaics and stained glass. Beneath the monumental statues representing servicewomen and the three branches of the military lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, representing all Australians who have given their lives during wartime.The museum has halls dedicated to WWI, WWII and conflicts from 1945 to the present day, as well as a spectacular aircraft hall. Every 15 minutes a sound-and-light show is staged in either the massive Anzac Hall or the Vietnam Gallery, starting with Striking by Night, which re-creates a WWII night operation over Berlin (staged on the hour).Free guided tours leave frequently from the main entrance's Orientation Gallery. Alternatively, purchase the self-guided tour leaflet ($5). There's also a free audio guide available for the WWI hall, where you can select from a range of themed tours."

Kids love panning for gold in the stream, watching the hourly gold pour and browsing ye olde lolly shop. While it's especially popular with children and families, it'll be enjoyed by all.\nThe main street is a living history museum, with people performing their chores dressed in costumes of the time; check the schedule for daily parades and demonstrations. Sovereign Hill opens again at night for the impressive sound-and-light show Aura, which through projections in the night sky tells the story of the Indigenous Wadawurrung, and describes the discovery of gold in Ballarat and how it shaped the town and beyond. Times vary, so check in advance; bookings are essential. The spooky lamplight tours, comprising a night walk through Sovereign Hill to learn the darker side of life on the goldfields, are also popular.In July the blockbuster Winter Wonderlights festival brings in the crowds for wintry Christmas festivities.Your ticket also gets you into the nearby Gold Museum, which sits on a mullock heap from an old mine. The museum has imaginative, modern displays and samples from all the old mining areas, as well as gold nuggets, coins and a display on the Eureka Rebellion.To get here from town, take bus 21 from Ballarat Station, or better, the free Gold Rush Express, which departs Ballarat Station at 10.40am (to meet the 9.16am train from Melbourne) and returns at 3.25pm; this service also gets you a 10% discount on entry fees."

    "detail_description": "Far from other Blue Mountains attractions, the limestone Jenolan Caves is one of the most extensive, accessible and complex systems in the world – a vast network that’s still being explored. The numerous caverns are a spectacular sight with vast subterranean spaces, otherworldly limestone formations and an underground river. Cave visits run throughout the day but book up fast, so it's worth reserving in advance online. If you don't, you may face a substantial wait at busy periods, especially if you're a group.\nNamed Binoomea (Dark Places) by the Gundungurra tribe, the caves took shape 400 million years ago. White explorers first passed through in 1836 and the caves were a major attraction by the 1860s.Cave tours cycle between different spaces. There are three standard tours: Chifley Cave, suitable for everyone, with spectacular formations and lots of crystal; Imperial Cave, the easiest on the legs; and Lucas Cave, which has more steps but lots of visual highlights. All three are suitable for children. Guides are informative and humorous, pointing out the inevitable nicknames of unusual formations.Less frequent tours head to Orient Cave, Temple of Baal and Diamond Cave, while small group visits head to the River Cave, Ribbon Cave and the Off the Track Tour. Beyond this, there are numerous packages and other special visits available, including adventure caving catering to three levels. The daily Plughole Adventure Tour ($130, two hours), with no experience necessary, is a good introduction to caving and includes a bit of abseiling.The caves are about 1½ hours' drive from Katoomba and the road is not suitable for caravans. On arrival, you pass through the Grand Arch, a spectacular rock tunnel from which the principal caves are accessed. Most car parking is a long walk from the caves, so you might want to let off some passengers just beyond the tunnel by the main Caves House complex, which includes a hotel, a restaurant serving breakfast and dinner daily and the ticket office. The return road through the tunnel is closed from 11.45am to 1.15pm, but you can make your way back by continuing past the caves towards Oberon. The closest fuel to the caves is in Oberon or Mount Victoria.There are various accommodation options, including the dated but characterful, heritage-listed Caves House – check the website for details – but there are good choices not far away that offer more peace and quiet, such as Jenolan Cabins.There is no public transport to the caves, but several tour companies offer trips. Otherwise you could walk here from Katoomba via the Megalong Valley along the 46km Six Foot Track, normally undertaken as a three-day hike."

    "detail_description": "This central section of Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park is a spectacular wilderness, with awe-inspiring vistas over Pittwater and Broken Bay, hidden beach communities, Aboriginal engravings and great walking tracks down to perfect little coves. It's accessed off Mona Vale Rd in Terrey Hills or via boat from Palm Beach. West Head itself, 14km from the main road, offers a sensational lookout point and a precipitous trail down to a WWII emplacement. Other trailheads are signposted along the road.\nThe West Head lookout sees you gazing eastwards over the Palm Beach peninsula or north to Lion Island and across Broken Bay to Umina and Pearl Beach.About 3.5km short of West Head is the Basin Track, which offers an easy stroll to a good set of Indigenous carvings. Approximately 2.5km further along the track is the Basin, a shallow round inlet where there is a beach (day visitors adult/child $3/2) and camping area. Access is via this track or by boat from Palm Beach. A branch off the Basin Track heads down to the remote, carless beachside suburbs of Mackerel Beach and Currawong (Little Mackerel) Beach, also accessible by ferry from Palm Beach.About 1km short of West Head, the Resolute picnic area has faint Indigenous handprints in ochre nearby at Red Hands Cave. Also from here, the Resolute Track, heads past an Aboriginal engraving site on a 3km loop that takes in pretty Resolute Beach and another site. You can push on a little (some wading required) to Mackerel Beach, allowing you to return via the Basin Track.Normally elusive, lyrebirds are conspicuous at West Head during their mating season, from May to July.Accessed via the same exit off Mona Vale Rd are the pretty Pittwater locales of Church Point, Akuna Bay and Cottage Point, all bristling with bobbing leisure boats. All have eating options. The scenic road winding along the water is curiously named after the liberator of Argentina, General José de San Martín. Apparently it was a reciprocal gesture after a Buenos Aires street was named Australia.There are no buses into the park. The only public transport to reach it are the ferries from Palm Beach. Cycling is a good option around the park's roads, but it's a long ride to here from the nearest station. Bus 270 goes from central Sydney to Terrey Hills; you could head on from there by taxi, Uber or perhaps bike-share. Sydney OutBack run good tours to the park."

    "detail_description": "The most arresting sight in the Horrocks/Port Gregory area is Hutt Lagoon, which is more commonly referred to as 'Pink Lake'. Yes, the saltwater here is pink, due to the presence of the algae Dunaliella salina. The algae is a source of beta-carotene, which is harvested here and used in food coloring and make-up.\nHow can I visit?\nYou can access the Pink Lake for free by car&nbsp;from George Grey Dr (the road south of Kalbarri), but it pays to take the turn-off to Port Gregory for the best viewpoints. The Coral Coast is renowned for its incredible scenic beauty, but this photo opportunity&nbsp;is a tough view to beat. You can also take popular sightseeing flights over the lake from Kalbarri and Geraldton.\nCan I swim in the Pink Lake?\nThough it is safe to go into the water, caution is advisable. The salt crystals on the bottom of the lake can be very sharp and could easily cut your bare feet. It is also imperative to take any rubbish or belongings with you when you leave to preserve the beauty of the area. The water levels in the lake drop during summer; it's advisable to visit outside of this time if you want to photograph Hutt Lagoon in all its glory.\n"

Jutting out from the ocean in spectacular fashion, these rocky stacks stand as if they've been abandoned to the waves by the retreating headland. Today only seven Apostles can be seen from a network of viewing platforms connected by timber boardwalks around the clifftops.\nHow to get there\nThere’s pedestrian access to the viewing platforms from the car park at the Twelve Apostles Visitor Centre – more a kiosk and toilets than an info centre – via a tunnel beneath the Great Ocean Road. It's a 4 hour drive from Melbourne along the Great Ocean Road or just a 10-minute drive from Port Campbell if you'd prefer more time to explore the area.\nBest time to visit\nThe best time to visit is sunset, not only for optimum photographic opportunities and to beat the tour buses but also to see little penguins returning ashore. Sightings vary, but generally the penguins arrive 20 to 40 minutes after sunset. They can be spotted from about 197ft (60m) away, so you'll need binoculars, which can be borrowed from the Port Campbell Visitor Centre.\n"

And when the wind is whispering in the sheoaks, it's a quietly moving place – as it has always been for the Nyaki-Nyaki people.\nBest trails at Wave Rock\nTo get the most out of Wave Rock, pick up the Walk Trails at Wave Rock and The Humps brochure from the visitor centre. A steep walk leads up around the summit of Hyden Rock, passing a dazzlingly insensitive concrete-block wall built along the crest of Wave Rock to stop stone-surfers from plunging to their deaths (you can't see the wall from the base of the rock). There's another good trail to Hippo's Yawn along a shady half-mile-long&nbsp;track from the base of Wave Rock.\nTickets and information\nParking at Wave Rock is $12 per car (pay at the parking meter); or you can save a few bucks by parking out on Wave Rock Rd or the visitor centre and walking in a few hundred metres – pay pedestrian fees at the caravan-park kiosk.\n"

If time allows explore South Head by foot, take a dip at Camp Cove or enjoy a leisurely lunch at one of its popular restaurants.&nbsp;On the ocean side, The Gap is a dramatic clifftop lookout worth a visit.\nBeaches\nThe closest spot for a swim is at Camp Cove, a short walk from Watsons Bay ferry terminal. It’s a small sheltered beach, perfect for families. At the eastern end, there’s a short jetty where you might find locals snorkelling, plus public toilets and a kiosk to buy refreshments.&nbsp;\nFurther around the harbour is Lady Bay Beach, a more secluded, clothing-optional, harbourside beach. It was the first nudist beach in Sydney to be given a nod from officials back in the 1970s (nudity is permitted on the beach only).&nbsp;&nbsp;\nRestaurants\nNext to the Beach Club, Doyles on the Beach is another Watsons Bay institution which opened here on the beach front in 1885. It also has a shopfront for takeaway on Fishermans Wharf. Slightly more upmarket again is Dunbar House, a 1830s restored mansion on Marine Parade that serves breakfast, lunch and high tea.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nWatsons Bay Hotel\nThe Watsons Bay Boutique Hotel is blessed with one of those iconic locations that you can’t miss. The ferry pulls up practically outside, sailing boats bob in the harbour, with views to Sydney city beyond. While you’re here, tradition demands that you sit in the Beach Club beer garden at sunset and watch the sun dissolve behind the Harbour Bridge, jutting above Bradley’s Head.\nFerry&nbsp;\nTo take the ferry to Watsons Bay, you can go direct from Circular Quay or as a stop on the way to and from Manly. The ferry leaves around every 30 mins and takes around 25 mins.\nLeave the car behind if visiting Watsons Bay; the parking options can't cope especially on weekends.\n&nbsp;\n"

Encouragingly as far as zoos go, Taronga is said to set benchmarks in animal care and welfare. If you want to know more go to their website where there is detailed information about the zoos contribution to conservation, transforming zoos, and caring for the wild.\nHighlights include the nocturnal platypus habitat, the Great Southern Oceans section and the Asian elephants enclosure. Feedings and encounters happen throughout the day, while in summer, twilight concerts jazz things up (see www.twilightattaronga.org.au).\nTickets&nbsp;\nPrebook your zoo tickets online for discounts of between 10% and 20%. There's also the option to include Wild Ropes, a high-ropes courses offering special views (it's cheaper to buy this with zoo entry than separately).\nAccommodation\nVisits to Taronga Zoo Sydney (and Taronga’s other Zoo in Dubbo outside Sydney) include Roar &amp; Snore, an overnight family glamping experience and a more luxurious eco-retreat also onsite at the zoo.&nbsp;\nGetting to Taronga Zoo&nbsp;\nIf you are driving and staying a while, note that the zoo car park is cheaper than the metered parking on the streets around.\nGetting here by bus is the cheapest option; the M30 heads here from Wynyard in Sydney’s city centre.\nTaronga Zoo ferry\nCatching the ferry is part of the fun of a visit to Taronga Zoo Sydney. From the wharf, the Sky Safari cable car or a bus will whisk you to the main entrance, from which you can traverse the zoo downhill back to the ferry.

It hosted its first game of Aussie Rules football in 1858, and in 1877 it was the venue for the first test cricket match between Australia and England. Since then, the ground has served as the central stadium for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics and played host to two Cricket World Cups, as well as the 2006 Commonwealth Games. It was also used as an army barracks during WWII. Despite this venerable history, the oldest parts of the current structure are the light towers, dating from the 1980s.\nA number of historical sporting items, including the hand-written notes defining the rules of Australian Rules Football, are on display at the Australian Sports Museum, located within the bowels of the stadium.\nThere’s plenty of evidence to suggest that Aboriginal Australians played a form of football called \"marngrook\" prior to European settlement. A scar tree near the MCG, from which bark was removed to make canoes, serves as a reminder that Melbourne’s cricket fans were not the first to gather at this site – some Indigenous Australians like to call it the Melbourne Corroboree Ground. Marngrook is remembered in the name of a trophy awarded to the winner of an annual AFL match.\n\n  \nThe best way to experience the MCG is to make it to a game © Darrian Traynor / Stringer / Getty Images\n\nHow to tour Melbourne Cricket Ground\nMake it to a game if you can (tickets for matches are available via the official stadium website); otherwise, there are non-match-day tours that take you through the stands, media and coaches’ areas, changing rooms and members' lounges. Discounts are available if you get a combined Australian Sports Museum and tour ticket.\nIf you're in the area and after a quick taste of a live AFL game, sometimes it's possible to wander in free of charge at three-quarter time (around 1½ hours after starting time) to see the last 30 minutes of the action.\n"

From the air, these stunning, 38-hectare gardens suggest a set of giant green lungs in the heart of the city.\nEvents and tours\nIn summer the gardens play host to Moonlight Cinema, a nightly pop-up cinema where cult classics and new release films are screened under the stars.&nbsp;Open-air theatre performances are another summer highlight from Shakespeare to Wind in the Willows, they’re often child-friendly events.&nbsp;\nChildren and parents will love the excellent, nature-based Ian Potter Foundation Children’s Garden, a whimsical, child-scaled place that invites exploration and water play.\nThe Aboriginal Heritage Walk comes highly recommended. This is a site of cultural significance to the local Kulin Nation (there’s a reason this vast green space was not buried under streets and houses when the British descended). On the tour you’ll learn to identify significant native plants with&nbsp;an Aboriginal guide, and gain some insight in the customs and ongoing connection to country of Australia’s First Nations people.\nThe visitor centre is the departure point for tours but book ahead&nbsp;(see the website for details). Close by, the National Herbarium, established in 1853, contains more than a million dried botanical specimens used for plant-identification purposes.\nAnd finally, the 19th-century Melbourne Observatory runs tours of the night sky here.&nbsp;\nRoyal Botanic Gardens cafes&nbsp;\nThis being Melbourne there are a few excellent cafes in and around the gardens including French-Vietnamese inspired Jardin Tan near entrance F.\nCranbourne Botanic Gardens\nFor visitors who can’t get enough, Royal Botanical Gardens has also developed the Australian Garden in the outlying suburb of Cranbourne which boasts 10kms of walking tracks through bushland and Australian landscapes.\n&nbsp;\n"

At this precise moment a shaft of light shines through an opening in the ceiling, passing over the Stone of Remembrance and illuminating the word ‘love’; on all other days this effect is demonstrated using artificial lighting on the hour.\nShrine of Remembrance eternal flame\nWith its cenotaph and eternal flame (lit by Queen Elizabeth II in 1954), the forecourt was built as a memorial to those who died in WWII. There are several other memorials surrounding the shrine. Below the shrine, a stunningly conceived architectural space houses the Galleries of Remembrance, a museum dedicated to telling the story of Australians at war via its 800-plus historical artefacts and artworks.\n\n  \nThe classical exterior of Melbourne's Shrine of Remembrance. ©Annie Leong/Shutterstock\n\nHistory \nBuilt between 1928 and 1934, much of it with Depression-relief, or ‘susso’ (sustenance) labour. Its stoic, classical design is partly based on the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus, one of the seven ancient wonders of the world. \nThe shrine's upper balcony affords epic panoramic views of Melbourne's skyline and all the way up tram-studded Swanston Street. This unobstructed view isn't coincidental; planning regulations continue to restrict any building that would encroach on the view of the shrine from Swanston Street as far back as Lonsdale Street.\nPlanning your visit \nDownload the free Shrine of Remembrance app for a self-guided tour, or consider joining the guided tours daily (free for Australian and New Zealand veterans and defence force personnel).\nKids can choose from four activity cards and learn about the Shrine, armed with an 'explorer kit'. Borrowed from the visitor centre, it features a periscope, a magnifying glass, a kaleidoscope and more.\nThe complex is under 24-hour police guard; during opening hours the police are required to wear uniforms resembling those worn by WWI light-horsemen. \n \n"

Surfers also carve up sandbar breaks at either end of the beach; it’s a good place for learners, too.&nbsp;\nAt the beach’s northern end there’s a grassy spot with coin-operated barbecues, but don't bring alcohol to your picnic – it's banned on the beach.

Free beach-friendly wheelchairs (for adults and children) can also be booked through the Bondi Pavilion.\nIf you’re looking for your LGBTQIA+ community, head to near the North Bondi Surf Club where there's an outdoor workout area. This is one of the main hangouts for queer beach-going Sydneysiders.\nTwo surf clubs – Bondi and North Bondi – patrol the beach between sets of red-and-yellow flags, positioned to avoid the worst rips and holes.

The beach is ringed by a shark net protecting it from great white sharks. Although it is not entirely shark-proof, the chance of a large shark entering the area is low, and surfers and lifeguards are on the lookout to keep swimmers safe.&nbsp;\nThe last major incident when the shark alarm was raised in 2019 -- the unmissable signal from lifeguards for everyone to evacuate the water -- turned out to be a false alarm. The shark spotted by two surfers was a harmless baby shark.&nbsp;\n\nHotels near Bondi Beach\nBondi is blessed with excellent accommodation options in every budget category.&nbsp;\nBondi Backpackers\nBaxley Bondi\nDive Hotel\nQT Bondi\n&nbsp;\n"

In winter add whale-watching to the reasons to visit.&nbsp;\nThe park takes in over 100km of coastline along the southern edge of Broken Bay, where it heads into the Hawkesbury River. There are two unconnected principal sections, Bobbin Head and the West Head area. The Barrenjoey headland at Palm Beach is also part of the park and the site of an historic&nbsp;lighthouse.\nThe second national park in Australia, Ku-ring-gai was created in 1894. Its name comes from its original inhabitants, the Guringai people, who were all but wiped out just after colonization through violence at the hands of settlers and the devastating introduction of smallpox. It’s well worth reading Kate Grenville’s The Secret River for an engrossing but harrowing telling of this story.\nRemnants of pre-colonial Aboriginal life are visible today thanks to the preservation of more than 800 sites, including rock paintings, middens and cave art.\nWalks&nbsp;\nElevated park sections offer glorious water views over Cowan Creek, Broken Bay and Pittwater. For information about walking trails, stop at the Bobbin Head Information Centre, operated by the NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service.
