    "detail_description": "This vibrant complex is without doubt one of the most atmospheric places to explore in Qatar. Built on an ancient market site, the area remains the social heart of Doha. Centuries ago, Bedouin would bring their sheep, goats and wool here to trade for essentials, and the entire market area has been cleverly redeveloped to look the part of a 19th-century souq, with mud-rendered shops and exposed timber beams, plus some authentic and beautifully restored original Qatari buildings.\nWith booming prosperity, the advent of vast air-conditioned shopping malls and Qatar's rush to embrace the new, Souq Waqif fell into serious decline by the 1990s, and much of the market was destroyed in a fire in 2003. An outcry from Qataris prompted the authorities to undertake a massive rehabilitation program, one that continues to this day. Such has been the success of this venture that the souq keeps growing to accommodate new ‘old alleyways’.Despite the ongoing gentrification of the area, the chief business of the souq continues unabated, and it remains one of the most traditional marketplaces in the region. This is the place to look for national Qatari dress, including the beautifully embroidered bukhnoq (girl’s head covering), spices, perfumes and oud (incense made from agarwood).Until land was reclaimed along Doha's waterfront in the 1970s, the waters lapped at the entrance to Souq Waqif, where traders were just as likely to arrive by boat as by camel. The first semi-permanent shops here were built around 250 years ago. Before that, vendors stood and sold their wares from makeshift stalls, as the market often flooded, and it is from this tradition that the souq's name derives: waqif means 'standing' in Arabic.The Falcon Souq is a highlight, but falconry is not the only traditional Qatari leisure pursuit you can see around the market. Nearby stables house Arabian horses and just off the Corniche end of Al Jasra St, a pen is filled with feeding camels most of the day.Animal lovers beware: located behind the colourful spice section of Souq Waqif is a collection of caged birds, and sometimes cats, rabbits, tortoises and dogs, kept outside in all weather: hot, hot and even hotter.Some of the shops are like museums, displaying artefacts (such as swords and shipping memorabilia), plus jewellery from around the Arab world. Many shops and stalls in the souq close around 1pm and reopen at 4pm, but the area, and its many cafes and restaurants, remains open all day."

A large commercial and pearling port was located here in the 18th and 19th centuries.\nInfo boards at the fort, which was used by the military until the 1980s, contain information on how remote villages like Al Zubarah used to find water in this stark and barren landscape. Archaeological excavations of the old pearling village are ongoing, but not open to visitors."

Until very recently, their whereabouts was all but a secret and only those in the know with a 4WD could find them. Up close some may feel underwhelmed by the poorly preserved shapes, but imagining communities here hundreds (perhaps thousands) of years ago is still an evocative experience.\nSome archaeologists have suggested the petroglyphs could date back to the 3rd century BC, while other experts believe they were created between the 10th and 18th centuries AD. The petroglyph site is located 60km north of Doha near the Buzwair Industrial Gases Factories. A 4WD is essential. Plan a trip with a local guide or tour operator as they will have the necessary permissions to enter the fenced-off site."

The whole lot is displayed in an enormous fort-like building, which was hand-cut from limestone, purely to house all these weird and wonderful items.\nThe seemingly endless displays include dozens of classic American cars, dhows (traditional wooden boats), motorbikes, full-sized stuffed camels and other desert creatures, plus controversial pieces such as an elephant's foot. Visitors will need a good few hours to take everything in, starting with the 10-minute educational video in which Sheikh Faisal talks about Qatari culture and heritage. There's a small cafe at the end of the museum.Tour operators in Doha run excursions here, or it's roughly 45 minutes by car from central Doha. You will have to show ID when entering the grounds, and entry is permitted up to an hour before closing time."
