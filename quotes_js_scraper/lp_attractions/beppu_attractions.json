    "detail_description": "You may be blown away by the versatility of bamboo, which grows copiously in the Beppu region. In the ground-floor gallery, intricate, refined pieces span workers' baskets to museum-quality art, made by Edo-period artisans and modern masters. Upstairs, try crafting bamboo yourself (from ¥400, depending on the complexity of the item), with a reservation at least a week ahead. A new, modernist-minimalist shop and cafe sells bamboo toys, tableware, baskets and handbags, priced from inexpensive to head-spinning.\nFrom Beppu Station, take bus 22 or 25 to Takezaiku-densankan-mae or bus 1 to Minami-baru (about 200m away)."

The circuit's eight stops have become mini amusement parks, each with a theme and some loaded with tourist kitsch; consider yourself warned. The hells are in two groups: six at Kannawa, over 4km northwest of Beppu Station, and two about 2.5km further north. Note: the combination ticket does not include Kannawa's Yama Jigoku.\nIn the Kannawa group are steaming blue Umi Jigoku; Oniishibōzu Jigoku, where the bubbling mud looks like a monk's shaved head; Shira-ike Jigoku; and Kamado Jigoku, so named because it was once used for cooking (kamado means stove in Japanese). At Oni-yama Jigoku and Yama Jigoku, a variety of animals are kept in enclosures that look uncomfortably small. To get here, take a bus from Beppu Station to Umi-Jigoku-mae (¥330).The smaller group of hells has Chi-no-ike Jigoku, named for the blood (chi) red of its photogenic water, and Tatsumaki Jigoku, where a geyser shoots off about every 35 minutes."
