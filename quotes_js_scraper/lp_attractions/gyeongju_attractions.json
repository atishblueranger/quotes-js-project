    "detail_description": "The huge, walled park has 23 tombs of Silla monarchs and family members. From the outside, they resemble substantial grassy hillocks that echo the mountains outside town. Many of the tumuli have yielded fabulous treasures, on display at the Gyeongju National Museum. One tomb, Cheonmachong, is open to visitors, but was shut for restoration at the time of writing. Thirteen metres high and 47m in diameter, the tomb was built around the end of the 5th century.\nFacsimiles of the golden crown, bracelets, jade ornaments, weapons and pottery found here are displayed in glass cases around the inside of the tomb.The park is a truly sublime and romantic place to wander, especially at dawn or at sunset. Never climb any of the burial mounds – the penalties are very severe and could put you in prison for up to two years. On colder days, the park closes at sunset."

Now it’s attractive parkland, where you can see some walls and ruins, as well as a huge and active excavation site. The only intact building is the early-18th-century Seokbinggo (Stone Ice House), which was once used as a food store and was restored in 1973. The hanja 石冰庫 (meaning 'Stone Ice House') is carved on the lintel over the entrance.\n"

The entire temple and pagoda was sent up in flames by the Mongols in 1238. The surviving foundation stones give an idea of the scale of the compound, which was astonishing in size.\nAt the time of writing, tentative plans were afoot to rebuild the pagoda. The on-site Hwangnyong-sa History and Culture Museum is well worth a visit for its film and exhibits relating to the temple."

From top to bottom there are 30 layers – one for each day of the month – and a total of 366 stones were used in its construction, corresponding (approximately) to the days of the year.

Most of the program is taught in English; reservations recommended.\nFrom Gyeongju intercity bus terminal, take a bus towards Gampo-ri or Yangbuk-myeon (bus 100 or 150) and ask the driver to drop you at Andongsamgeo-ri, where the turnoff to the temple is off to the left.

Sitting within its rotunda is a statue of Buddha surrounded by over three dozen guardians and lesser deities, including an 11-faced Gwan-eum (관음). The set up is a little underwhelming, though: Buddha sits behind glass that reflects light and you can actually see very little as you must stand at a distance.\nThe carving of Gwan-eum (the Goddess of Mercy) is not visible, hidden behind the main statue, so you have to make do with a poor quality photograph. Photography is not allowed.Buddha's position gazing over the East Sea (visible in clear weather) has long made him regarded as a protector of his country. Seokguram was quite a feat of engineering when it was constructed in the mid-8th century. Huge blocks of granite were quarried far to the north at a time when the only access to the Seokguram site (740m above sea level) was a narrow mountain path.But it is the setting that is most rewarding, after you are quickly filed past the image of Buddha, so revel in the mountain scenery. The 2.2km walk down the steps to Bulguk-sa is enjoyable and not strenuous, or you can continue uphill to the peak of Toham-san, 1.4km distant.Bus 12 runs hourly between the car parks for Bulguk-sa and Seokguram (₩1500, 20 minutes). From the Seokguram car park, it is a 400m walk along a shaded gravel track to the grotto."

The museum is an easy 150m walk from the east side of Wolseong-gongwon and is well signed.\nYou’ll find an entire building devoted to the findings at Anapji Pond, an art hall focusing on Buddhist works and a temporary exhibition hall.Outside the main hall, the Emille Bell (King Seongdeok’s Bell) is one of the largest and most beautifully resonant bells ever made in Asia. It’s said that its ringing can be heard over a 3km radius when struck only lightly with the fist. Unfortunately, you aren’t allowed to test this claim. A couple of ancient stupas can also be found within the grounds.There are English signs throughout and an interesting multilingual audioguide is available (₩3000). English-speaking tours run on Saturdays at 1.30pm (March to November)."

The buildings burned in 935 and many relics ended up in the pond itself, to be rediscovered only when it was drained for repair in 1975.\nThousands of well-preserved relics were found including wooden objects, a die used in drinking games, scissors and a royal barge – you can see them in the Gyeongju National Museum. Several reconstructed pavilions have been converted to exhibition spaces displaying objects associated with the temple and the pond, while the grounds make a pleasant place for a stroll.

    "detail_description": "Close to the summit of the thickly forested Obong-san (640m), Bokdu-am features a huge rock face out of which 19 niches have been carved. The three central niches hold a figure of the historical Buddha flanked by two bodhisattva (Munsu and Bohyeon); the remainder house the 16 nahan (arhat) monks who have attained Nirvana. Just below the hermitage is a stunning viewpoint from the top of a couple of massive boulders. It’s a great place for a picnic lunch.\nThe carvings are recent and although there’s an unoccupied house up here, the actual hermitage was burned down in 1988 after an electrical fault started a blaze. There is also a statue of Gwanseeum, the Goddess of Mercy (whose name means the one who 'listens to the cries of the world'), just beyond the rock face.The trail is easy to follow, but bring water as there are no springs along the way. The walk up will take around an hour. From the bus stop in Songseon-ri (송선리), follow the creek up along the narrow road about 500m to a small temple, Seongam-sa. The trail starts just to the left of this temple and is well marked in Korean.A further 3.8km up the road from the bus stop for Bokduam and Jusaam, remote Sinseon-sa near the top of Danseok-san (827m), is believed to be one of the oldest cave temples in Korea. About 50m to the right as you face the temple are some ancient rock carvings in a small grotto. The temple was used as a base by General Kim Yu-shin in the 7th century and has seen renovation work since then. It’s about a two-hour circuit walk from the bus stop. There’s a little village along the way, about 2.5km from the bus stop.Bus 300 (₩1800, every 25 minutes) travels to Obong-san and stops near Jusaam. If you’re looking for a more direct route to Sinseon-sa, take bus 350 (₩1800, every one to two hours) and get off at Ujung-gol (우중골). From the intercity bus terminal, catch either bus at the stop near Paris Baguette on Daejung-no."

    "detail_description": "On a series of stone terraces about 16km southeast of Gyeongju, set among gnarled pines and iris gardens, this historic temple is the crowning glory of Silla architecture and is on the Unesco World Cultural Heritage list, although much was destroyed by the Japanese in 1593 and has been rebuilt. The name of the temple means 'World of Buddha Temple' – the hanja (Sino-Korean) name you will see is 佛國寺 (literally 'Buddha World Temple').\nThe approach to the temple leads you to two national-treasure bridges (actually a pair of white stone staircases, which take the ancient Korean name for a bridge, 'gyo': 橋); one called Cheongungyo (Blue Cloud Bridge), the other Baegungyo (White Cloud Bridge). One of these bridges has 33 steps, representing the 33 stages to enlightenment; both lead up to the main gate, however you cannot climb them and need to access the temple from the road uphill to the right.The main hall is the Daeungjeon Hall (大雄殿; Main Buddha Hall) which dates to 1765, as the original was burned in the late 16th century. In front of the main hall are two more national treasures: two pagodas that somehow survived Japanese destruction. The first, Dabotap (Many Treasures Pagoda), is of plain design and typical of Silla artistry, while the other, Seokgatap (Sakyamuni Pagoda), is much more ornate and typical of the neighbouring Baekje kingdom. When the latter was restored in 1966, it was found to contain a copy of a sutra that is one of the world's oldest woodblock print books. The pagodas are so revered that replicas appear in the grounds of the Gyeongju National Museum.Other halls you will find are the much more recently constructed Nahanjeon Hall (where Buddha is flanked by 16 nahan, or arhats) and a shrine to the Goddess of Mercy (Avalokitesvara), the Gwon-eum-Jon (the original dated to the 8th century, but this is a 20th century reconstruction).You can reach Bulguk-sa by loop buses 10 or 11 (₩1500, 30 minutes), though from central Gyeongju 11 is much quicker. There’s a tourist information booth in the car park, near the bus stop. From Bulguk-sa, you can either take the regular bus 12 to Seokguram, or walk the 2.2km route uphill."
