Its simple displays (in Spanish) are moving: there are eyewitness accounts of the horrors that occurred and a particularly poignant montage of photos by mothers whose children were killed in the fighting.\nSome of the mothers still staff the museum, and may talk to you about this terrible time, if your Spanish is up to it. Donations are gratefully accepted. The museum is located 1.5km northwest of the city center."

The moody facade doesn’t quite prepare you for the intricacy of the interior, with its elaborate gold-leaf altar being one of the best examples of the baroque-churrigueresque style (in which cornices and other intricate, Spanish-influenced workmanship mingled with Andean influences, often evinced by the wildlife depicted).\nThese altars also demonstrate how the concept of the retablo, the ornamental religious dioramas that are Ayacucho's most famous export, came about. The word originally meant 'behind the altar' in reference to the statues placed within cases and set behind early altars. Ten such altars are contained here. Ask at the shop at the entrance about visiting the cathedral's catacombs."
