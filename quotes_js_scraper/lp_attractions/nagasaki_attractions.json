    "detail_description": "A still, serene and deeply moving place, Nagasaki's Peace Park commemorates the atomic bombing of the city on August 9, 1945, which reduced the surrounding area to rubble and claimed tens of thousands of&nbsp;lives. Together with the Atomic Bomb Museum and National Peace Memorial Hall (both a short walk away), this is an essential stop for any visitor who wants to understand how the disaster shaped the city.\nThe green, spacious park is presided over by the 10-tonne bronze Nagasaki Peace Statue, designed in 1955 by Kitamura Seibō. It also includes the dove-shaped Fountain of Peace (1969) and the Peace Symbol Zone, a sculpture garden with contributions on the theme of peace from around the world.\nPractically adjoining the park to the south is the smaller Atomic Bomb Hypocentre Park, with a monument marking the epicentre of the deadly blast.\nOn 9 August a rowdy antinuclear protest is held within earshot of the more formal official memorial ceremony for those lost to the bomb.\n"

Several buildings here have been beautifully restored and offer glimpses of Japan's early interest in the West. The Japanese name 'Oranda-zaka' comes from the Japanese word for Holland. It's a lovely stroll, and the quiet Ko-shashin-shiryōkan and Maizō-shiryōkan museums showcase the area's history (note that most signage is in Japanese).\n"

Except for one building that still stands as it did following the bombing (to the right at the top of the stairs), and the presence of some new exhibits, this functioning school looks much like any other, albeit with the addition of sculptures, monuments and memorials to the victims.\nThe last of these is laden with strands of 1000 origami cranes, the traditional children's prayer for peace."

Already suffering from leukaemia, Dr Nagai survived the atomic explosion but lost his wife to it. He immediately devoted himself to the treatment of bomb victims until his death in 1951. In his final days he continued to write prolifically and to secure donations for survivors and orphans, earning the nickname 'Saint of Nagasaki'. Ask to watch the video in English.\nNext door is Nyokodō (如己堂), the simple hut from which Dr Nagai worked – its name comes from the biblical commandment 'love thy neighbour as thyself'."

Glover Garden is named after Scottish merchant and industrialist Thomas Glover (1838–1911), who built Japan's first railway and helped establish the shipbuilding industry, and whose arms-importing operations influenced the course of the Meiji Restoration.\nStart by taking the moving walkways to the top of the hill, then work your way back down.The Mitsubishi No 2 Dock building is at the top, with panoramic views of the city and harbour from the 2nd floor. Next highest is Walker House, filled with artefacts donated by the Glover and Walker families, followed by Ringer House, Alt House and finally Glover House. Halfway down is the Madame Butterfly Statue of Japanese opera singer Tamaki Miura. Exit the garden through the Nagasaki Traditional Performing Arts Museum, which has a display of dragons and floats used in Nagasaki's colourful Kunchi Matsuri.The 'audio pen' guide, available near the ticket office, gives lots of detailed commentary and costs ¥700, although the map that comes with it can be confusing."

Today the city has filled in around the island and you might be tempted to skip it. Don't. Seventeen buildings, walls and structures (plus a miniature Dejima) have been painstakingly reconstructed.\nRestored and reopened in 2006 and constantly being upgraded, the buildings are as instructive inside as they are appealing outside, filled with exhibits covering the spread of trade, Western learning and culture, archaeological digs, and rooms combining Japanese tatami (tightly woven floor matting) with Western wallpaper. There's excellent English signage. Allow at least two hours.Free walking-tour maps of the entire site are available, and there's even a kimono-rental shop (¥2000/6000 per hour/day) for those who want to feel even more historically connected."

Up close, this long-abandoned coal mine looks as though it's straight out of an apocalyptic manga (even appearing as the villain's lair in the 2012 James Bond film Skyfall). Once earth's most densely populated place, it became a ghost island when the mines were closed in 1974, and it's been left to nature since, now accessible only by guided tour.\nAccess is restricted because so many structures have collapsed or been damaged that much of the island is unsafe. Guided tours allow visitors to ramble on walkways among the long-disused skyscrapers. Some of the architecture (such as the iconic 'X' stairways – alas, not visible on the tour) was considered remarkable for its time, as engineers tackled the challenges of designing for such cramped living.While most of the spoken guiding is in Japanese, English info is available. Three-hour cruises from Nagasaki run twice daily from April to October; there are fewer departures November to March. Contact Gunkanjima Concierge for reservations."
