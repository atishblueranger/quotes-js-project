    "detail_description": "Once the very symbol of Amalfi’s power, Cattedrale di Sant’Andrea (also known as Duomo di Amalfi) is the town’s most iconic monument to this day. It’s a must visit for everyone traveling to the Amalfi Coast… did you really visit if you didn't take a photo on the iconic stairs of the Duomo?\nA true testament to Amalfi’s past as a melting pot of cultural influxes from everywhere in the Mediterranean (and beyond), the Cathedral has an eclectic appearance due to its long history and its many renovations throughout the centuries. In fact, the monumental complex is made up of various components: the main cathedral, the atrium, the Cloister of Paradise, the crypt and the Church of the Crucifix.\nHistory of the Cattedrale di Sant’Andrea\nAs the first maritime republic, Amalfi dominated the sea in the Middle Ages and traded vastly with all peoples overlooking the Mediterranean. Every detail in the Duomo is a direct consequence of this. The original structure of the Cathedral dates back to the sixth century BCE; it was then annexed to a newer building in the 13th century, and ornamental changes and decorative additions continued in the centuries to come. The newer part was built to house the relics of St. Andrew that arrived from Constantinople in 1208 after the Fourth Crusade. \n\n  \nThe duomo's interior arches are a sight to behold © Shutterstock / Gabriele Maltinti\n\nHow to make the most of your visit to Amalfi’s Duomo?\nThe first thing you realize upon arriving in Piazza Duomo, the iconic main square of Amalfi, is that the church dominates it – you face a majestic staircase of 62 steps elevating the cathedral 20m (66ft) above street level. Before you brave the climb, walk across the small piazza to see St. Andrew from every possible angle. Some people say the best pictures of the duomo are from the harbor, with the facade and the colorful bell tower peeping out, sandwiched between pink and yellow structures.\nStand directly in front of the cathedral at the bottom of the steps to admire the grandiose facade, ornate with colorful mosaics of the saints, majolica, geometric designs, striped pillars and arched windows. At the top of the stairs, pause in the atrium. The massive bronze door to the cathedral, the first of its kind in Italy, was cast in Constantinople in 1057; it's a sign that Amalfi’s prestige and wealth had no equal at the time.\nIf you climbed the steps on a hot summer day, you might need a break. Turn around, approach one of the triple-arched windows onto the stairs and wait for your turn – tourists will be taking pictures from there, posing within the window's frame. The shade of the atrium creates a drastic dichotomy with the sunlight just outside, a great contrast for your photo. \nThe Cloister of Paradise\nProceed to the right and enter the Moorish-style cloister known as Chiostro del Paradiso. The ticket booth is on your way, and the €3 required to visit the entire Monumental Complex is worth it. In the Paradise Cloister, you’ll be overwhelmed by daylight – a stark contrast with the atrium – so put on your sunglasses. The cloister, built in the 1260s to host the tombs of the Amalfi nobility, is an open peristyle surrounded by 120 slim columns supporting Arabic arches. Two colors reign supreme: the pure white of the marble and the bright green of the Mediterranean garden at the center. Sheltered from the chaos of the atrium, the cloister feels like a world apart. It’s silent, as if every visitor is upholding an unspoken agreement to keep quiet. From the garden, you get a unique view of the majolica bell tower peeping through the palms. \nWalk the peristyle and observe the remnants of the colorful mosaics along the wall and religious-themed frescos dating back to the 13th century in the small funerary chapels. You’ll encounter classical sarcophagi from the second century ACE representing scenes from Ancient Greek and Roman myths.\n\n  \nThe Basilica of the Crucifix dates back to ancient Rome © Shutterstock / lingling7788\n\nThe Basilica of the Crucifix and the Crypt of Sant’Andrea\nFollow the path to the single-naved Basilica of the Crucifix. This was the original church built in the sixth century, and today it primarily hosts the collection of the Diocesan Museum: part of the treasury, ancient artifacts of immense historical value and more religious frescoes in the side chapels. The columns and capitals date back to Ancient Roman times. \nFrom here you access the crypt. Don't worry, it’s not at all creepy. You’ll only know you’re underground because the temperature decreases a bit, a welcome relief from the heat of Amalfi in summer. A mausoleum for St. Andrew Apostle and a triumph in Baroque/late Mannerismhe, the crypt is a work of art in its entirety: take in the frescoed vault, the statues, the reliefs and the stucco work. In true Baroque style, there is an abundance of ornaments that show off the wealth and taste of the commissioner, King Philip III of Spain. \nBeneath the central altar of the crypt, under the watchful eye of the dark statue of St. Andrew, resides a sacred ampulla. In it is the miraculous manna, a liquid substance that comes out of his tomb on his sacred day, a miracle that's been happening for nearly 750 years. Amalfi residents celebrate the patron saint and his miracle on two different occasions every year – June 27 and November 30 – and if you’re in Amalfi on either of those days, you’ll witness feasts and processions.\nInside Cattedrale di Sant’Andrea\nAfter taking your time admiring the Crypt, you’re ready to visit the Cathedral proper. The original Romanesque layout of the church was destroyed in the 18th century, when the cathedral adopted a Baroque aesthetic. The ceiling is made entirely of gold, save for the four vaults depicting images of St. Andrew’s life painted by Neapolitan artist Francesco Solimena, who also created the image of the crucified Apostle above the main altar. \nWalk by the side chapels and note their unique depictions, artifacts and decorative elements spanning from Gothic to Moorish to Renaissance to Rococo styles, an exercise that reminds you that the cathedral is an amalgamation of different cultures and time periods.  \nOpening hours and tickets for Cattedrale di Sant’Andrea\nEntrance to the Cathedral of St. Andrew is free during religious ceremonies and mass. Tickets for the whole Monumental Complex are €3, giving you access to the Cloister of Paradise, the Crypt and the Diocesan Museum in the Basilica of the Crucifix. The visiting hours of the duomo vary depending on the season – it’s open between 9:00am and 6:45pm every day between March and June; it closes one hour later in high summer between July and September. From November to February, the cathedral is open every day between 10 am and 1 pm, then again between 2:30pm and 4:30pm. At any time, please be mindful of your attire, as you are entering a religious site.\nInsider Tip\nEither before or after visiting the cathedral, don’t overlook the Fountain of Sant’Andrea at the center of Piazza Duomo. Made of marble in Baroque style, it represents Amalfi’s patron saint with his eponymous saltire, the overturned cross of his martyrdom. Beneath the sculpture of the saint on the basin, stand a siren, a satyr and an eagle, all sculpted in the 1500s. \n"

    "detail_description": "For the classicist, Syracuse's real attraction is this archaeological park, home to the pearly Teatro Greco. Constructed in the 5th century BC and rebuilt in the 3rd century, the 16,000-capacity amphitheatre staged the last tragedies of Aeschylus (including The Persians), first performed here in his presence. From early May to early July it's brought to life with an annual season of classical theatre.\nBeside the theatre is the mysterious Latomia del Paradiso, a deep, precipitous limestone quarry out of which stone for the ancient city was extracted. Riddled with catacombs and filled with citrus and magnolia trees, it's also where the 7000 survivors of the war between Syracuse and Athens in 413 BC were imprisoned. The Orecchio di Dionisio, a 23m-high grotto extending 65m back into the cliffside, was named by Caravaggio after the tyrant Dionysius, who is said to have used the almost perfect acoustics of the quarry to eavesdrop on his prisoners.Back outside this area you'll find the entrance to the 2nd-century Anfiteatro Romano, originally used for gladiatorial combats and horse races. The Spaniards, little interested in archaeology, largely destroyed the site in the 16th century, using it as a quarry to build Ortygia's city walls. West of the amphitheatre is the 3rd-century-BC Ara di Gerone II, a monolithic sacrificial altar to Hieron II, where up to 450 oxen could be killed at one time.To reach the park, take Sd'A Trasporti minibus 2 (€1, 15 minutes) from Molo Sant'Antonio, on the west side of the main bridge into Ortygia; purchase tickets on-board. Alternatively, walking from Ortygia will take about 30 minutes. If driving, there is limited free parking on Viale Augusto.There are two ticket offices: one office is located near the corner of Via Cavallari and Viale Augusto, opposite the main site, while the second outlet is located down the path leading to the actual ruins. Those wanting a break will find a cafe between the second ticket office and the Anfiteatro Romano."

The piazza's poetic name (Field of Flowers) is a reference to the open meadow that stood here before the square was laid out in the mid-15th century.\nThe market runs every day excluding Sundays from 7am to 2pm and while souvenir stalls have now replaced many of the fruit and vegetable stands Campo de’ Fiori is still worth visiting to immerse yourself in the lively atmosphere.\n\n  \nImmerse yourself in the lively atmosphere of Campo de' Fiori © Matej Kastelic / Shutterstock\n\nHistory\nFor centuries the square was the site of public executions. It was here that philosopher Giordano Bruno was burned for heresy in 1600, now marked by a sinister statue of the hooded monk, created by Ettore Ferrari in 1889. \nClose to the western end of the square you may also notice a circular fountain. While Rome definitely boasts more impressive fountains, this has a fun history – Giacomo della Porta designed the monument in 1590 to adorn the piazza, but its decorative purpose was quickly forgotten by market vendors who began using its waters to wash the produce. Unable to stop the pragmatic merchants, the city decided to cover it with a stone lid in 1622 – an action that resulted in Romans nicknaming the fountain “terrina” due to its resemblance to a soup tureen. The fountain was removed to make space for Giordano Bruno’s statue; the current monument is a 19th-century replica of Della Porta’s design.\nTwo important Renaissance palaces are just around the corner from Campo de’ Fiori: Palazzo Farnese, now housing the French Embassy, and the Palazzo della Cancelleria, hosting a permanent exhibition dedicated to Leonardo da Vinci’s inventions.\nNearby bars and restaurants\nCraft beer lovers can quench their thirst at Open Baladin, the pub of the Piedmontese brewery with the same name where 40 beers on tap – including the signature “Zucca” pumpkin ale – are available to try. A more intimate but equally hoppy atmosphere is found in MyAle in Via dei Cappellari, where craft brews are served on the side of charcuterie boards and stuffed focaccias.\nTalking about focaccia, the historic Forno Campo de’ Fiori sees people queue for its “white pizza” filled with mortadella, while Antico Forno Roscioli is somewhat of an institution when it comes to the quintessentially Roman “pizza rossa.”\n"

    "detail_description": "Cefalù's cathedral is one of the jewels in Sicily's Arab-Norman crown, only equalled in magnificence by the Cattedrale di Monreale and Palermo's Cappella Palatina. Filling the central apse, a towering figure of Cristo Pantocratore (Christ All Powerful) is the focal point of the elaborate Byzantine mosaics – Sicily's oldest and best preserved, predating those of Monreale by 20 or 30 years.\nIn his hand, a compassionate-looking Christ holds an open Bible bearing a Latin and Greek inscription. Other mosaic groups include the Virgin with Four Archangels dressed as Byzantine officials.The 16 interior columns with Roman capitals probably came from the Tempio di Diana on La Rocca.Legend tells us that the cathedral was built by Roger II in the 12th century to fulfil a vow to God after his fleet was saved during a violent storm off Cefalù. In fact, it was more likely the result of Roger's tempestuous relationship with the Palermitan archbishopric. Eager to curb the growing influence of the papacy in Sicily (with whom the Palermo archbishopric had close ties), Roger thought that building a mighty church so far from Palermo would prove an effective reminder of his power across the island and pose a disincentive to any potential usurpers. It's thus hardly surprising that the cathedral's architecture is distinctly fortress-like.You can enjoy the view of the cathedral's soaring twin pyramid towers, framed by La Rocca, over a morning coffee or evening aperitivo in the Piazza del Duomo. Better yet, climb the towers themselves for lofty perspectives over the town, the cathedral's interior and the sparkling Tyrrhenian Sea. In 2019 the towers were opened to the public for the first time; to enter, buy a special €5 ticket at the door, which also grants access to close-up views of the famous Cristo Pantocratore mosaic from a privileged position within the apse.A separate €5 ticket grants access to the cathedral's treasury and cloisters. The treasury houses a wide array of ecclesiastical vestments and ornate metalwork, while the cloisters are noteworthy for their ancient columns supporting graceful Arab-Norman arches. The finely carved capitals depict a mix of religious and secular images – among the most interesting are the depictions of acrobats, a pair of crocodiles and Noah's Ark."

    "detail_description": "Baldassare Longhena's magnificent basilica is prominently positioned near the entrance to the Grand Canal, its white stones, exuberant statuary and high domes gleaming spectacularly under the sun. The church makes good on an official appeal by the Venetian Senate directly to the Madonna in 1630, after 80,000 Venetians had been killed by plague. The Senate promised the Madonna a church in exchange for her intervention on behalf of Venice – no expense or effort spared.\nBefore 'La Salute' could even be started, at least 100,000 pylons had to be driven deep into the barene (mudbanks) to shore up the tip of Dorsoduro. The Madonna provided essential inspiration, but La Salute draws its structural strength from a range of architectural and spiritual traditions. Architectural scholars note striking similarities between Longhena's unusual domed octagonal structure and both Greco-Roman goddess temples and Jewish Kabbalah diagrams. The lines of the building converge beneath the dome to form a vortex on the inlaid marble floors; some believe the black dot at the centre radiates healing energy.The basilica's interior is flooded with light filtered through disks of pale-tinted glass encircling the implausibly high dome. The main focus of devotion is the elaborately carved baroque high altar, with a 12th-century Cretan icon of the Madonna of Good Health set into it. A side altar near the entrance to the sacristy showcases The Descent of the Holy Spirit (1546) by Titian.Entry to the church is free, but there is a charge to visit the art-slung sacristy (closed on Sunday mornings). The sacristy is a wonder within a wonder, its glorious collection of Titian masterpieces including moody ceiling frescoes, a vivid self-portrait in the guise of St Matthew, and his earliest known work, Saint Mark Enthroned with Sts Cosmas, Damian, Roch &amp; Sebastian (1510). Salute's most charming allegory for Venice's miraculous survival of the plague is Palma il Giovane's painting of Jonah emerging from the mouth of the whale, where the survivor stomps down the creature's tongue like an action hero walking the red carpet. Life in a time of plague is a miracle worth celebrating in Tintoretto’s upbeat Wedding Feast of Cana (1561), featuring a Venetian throng of multicultural musicians, busy wine pourers and Tintoretto himself, depicted with a long beard near the bottom left of the canvas."

    "detail_description": "Parts of San Gimignano's Romanesque cathedral were built in the second half of the 11th century, but its remarkably vivid frescoes, depicting episodes from the Old and New Testaments, date from the 14th century. Look out, too, for the Cappella di Santa Fina, near the main altar – a Renaissance chapel adorned with naive and touching frescoes by Domenico Ghirlandaio, depicting the life of one of the town's patron saints. These featured in Franco Zeffirelli's 1999 film Tea with Mussolini.\nEntry is via the side stairs and through a loggia that was originally covered and functioned as the baptistry. Once in the main space, face the altar and look to your left (south). On the wall are scenes from Genesis and the Old Testament by Bartolo di Fredi, dating from around 1367. The top row runs from the creation of the world through to the forbidden-fruit scene. This leads to the next level and fresco, the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, which sustained some damage in WWII. Further scenes include Cain killing Abel, and the stories of Noah's ark and Joseph's coat. The last level continues with the tale of Moses leading the Jews out of Egypt, and the story of Job.On the right (north) wall are scenes from the New Testament by the workshop of Simone Martini (probably led by Lippo Memmi, Martini's brother-in-law), which were completed in 1336. Again, the frescoes are spread over three levels, starting in the six lunettes at the top. Starting with the Annunciation, the panels work through episodes such as the Epiphany, the presentation of Christ in the temple and the massacre of the innocents on Herod's orders. The subsequent panels on the lower levels summarise the life and death of Christ, the Resurrection and so on. Again, some have sustained damage, but most are in good condition.On the inside wall of the front facade, extending onto adjoining walls, is Taddeo di Bartolo's striking depiction of the Last Judgement – on the upper-left side is a fresco depicting Paradiso (Heaven) and on the upper-right Inferno (Hell). The fresco of San Sebastian under them is by Benozzo Gozzoli.The church is commonly known as the 'Collegiata', a reference to the college of priests that originally managed it. An audio guide tour is included in the cost of entry. Joint tickets covering the Collegiata and Museo d'Arte Sacra cost adult/reduced €6/3, offering a saving of €1.50/1."

    "detail_description": "It's in this Masonic-inspired baroque chapel that you'll find Giuseppe Sanmartino's incredible sculpture, Cristo velato (Veiled Christ), its marble veil so realistic that it's tempting to try to lift it and view Christ underneath. It's one of several artistic wonders that include Francesco Queirolo's sculpture Disinganno (Disillusion), Antonio Corradini's Pudicizia (Modesty) and riotously colourful frescoes by Francesco Maria Russo that have remained untouched since their creation in 1749.\nOriginally built around the end of the 16th century to house the tombs of the di Sangro family, the chapel was given its current baroque fit-out by Prince Raimondo di Sangro, who, between 1749 and 1766, commissioned the finest artists to adorn the interior. In Queirolo's Disinganno, the man trying to untangle himself from a net represents Raimondo's father, Antonio, Duke of Torremaggiore. After the premature death of his wife, Antonio abandoned the young Raimondo, choosing instead a life of travel and hedonistic pleasures. Repentant in his later years, he returned to Naples and joined the priesthood, his attempt to free himself from sin represented in Queirolo's masterpiece.Even more poignant is Antonio Corradini's Pudicizia, whose veiled female figure pays tribute to Raimondo's mother, Cecilia Gaetani d’Aquila d’Aragona. Raimondo was only 11 months old when she died, and the statue's lost gaze and broken plaque represent a life cruelly cut short.The chapel's original polychrome marble flooring was badly damaged in a major collapse involving the chapel and the neighbouring Palazzo dei di Sangro in 1889. Designed by Francesco Celebrano, the flooring survives in fragmentary form in the passageway leading off from the chapel's right side. The passageway leads to a staircase, at the bottom of which you'll find two meticulously preserved human arterial systems – one of a man, the other of a woman. Debate still circles the models: are the arterial systems real or reproductions? And if they are real, just how was such an incredible state of preservation achieved? More than two centuries on, the mystery surrounding the alchemist prince and his abilities lives on.Queues here can be notoriously long so consider purchasing your ticket online in advance for fast-track entry into the chapel; it's worth the extra €2 booking fee, especially during peak holiday periods."

Over 200 busts of Italian patriots who have contributed to Italy’s unification are scattered around the hill.\nOn the Gianicolo Hill you will find the Acqua Paola Fountain, one of the most impressive water monuments found in the city, dating back to 1612 and locally nicknamed il fontanone (the big fountain) for obvious reasons. The marble masterpiece may look familiar – it appears in the opening scene of Paolo Sorrentino's 2013 Academy-Award-winning film La Grande Bellezza (The Great Beauty). Materials from both the Roman Forum and the ancient St Peter's Basilica were used to build the fountain.\n\n  \nThe best unobstructed views of Rome are found further north beyond the snack stands © Elena Odareeva / Shutterstock\n\nOrto Botanico\nThe hill is also home to Rome’s Orto Botanico (Botanical Garden), one of Italy’s largest where over 3000 species of plants – including secular Himalayan trees and a bamboo forest – coexist in the grounds once belonging to Villa Corsini. The Botanical Garden originated in the 17th century and is managed by Sapienza University. Entrance to the Botanical Garden costs €5.\nFaro del Gianicolo\nSomething you wouldn’t expect to see in the heart of Rome is a lighthouse, though the Faro del Gianicolo (Gianicolo’s Lighthouse) is not meant to show the way to incoming ships. Italian expatriates in Argentina gifted the city with this marble monument in 1911, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Italy’s unification.\nTips and other practical information\nRome's highest hill is a superb viewpoint with sweeping panoramas over Rome’s rooftops, and has several summer-only bars that are blessed with thrilling views. There are also weekend children’s puppet shows on the hill (a long-standing tradition) and a small collection of carnival rides.\nPro tip: trees obstruct the stunning views from many vantage points, so go just north of the snacks stands near the Garibaldi Monument to see Rome before you in all its glory.\nTake bus 115 from the Viale di Trastevere to Gianicolo, then walk back down, stopping at the Tempietto di Bramante &amp; Chiesa di San Pietro in Montorio.\n"

    "detail_description": "There are castles and then there’s Ischia’s Castello Aragonese, a veritable fort-city set on its own craggy islet, looking like a cross between Harry Potter’s Hogwarts and Mont Saint Michel. While Syracusan tyrant Gerone I built the first fortress here in 474 BC, the bulk of the current structure dates from the 1400s, when King Alfonso of Aragon gave the older Angevin fortress a thorough makeover, building the fortified bastions, current causeway and access ramp cut into the rock.\nAt the base of the complex you pay the entrance fee and then ascend via a lift or a series of paths that take you on a looping route through the buildings and lush gardens. The signposted route starts with the relatively modern and plain Chiesa dell'Immacolata, built in 1737 over an old church. Commissioned by the adjoining Convento delle Clarisse (Convent for Clarisse nuns), it was left in its minimalist state after building funds ran out. Next door, the nuns contributed to the castle's most bizarre and macabre sight. When the erstwhile sisters died, their corpses were taken into the windowless, airless Cimitero delle Monache Clarisse where they were propped up on toilet-like chairs. The living nuns were expected to pray daily to the decomposing corpses as a grim reminder of their own mortality. Not surprisingly, many of them caught diseases in the process, some fatal. The empty chairs remain on view in the cellars as a chilling reminder.Far brighter are the sunbaked, stuccoed ruins of the 14th-century Cattedrale dell’Assunta, which collapsed under cannon fire in 1809 as the British tried to shell Napoleon's occupying army into submission. The 11th-century crypt below features snippets of 14th-century frescoes inspired by Giotto.Carry on until you reach the elegant, hexagonal Chiesa di San Pietro a Pantaniello and sombre Carcere Borbonico, the one-time prison for leading figures of the Risorgimento (the 19th-century Italian unification movement), such as Poerio, Pironti, Nusco and Settembrini. There's a small and grisly Museo delle Torture, with a collection of medieval torture instruments and impressive armour and weaponry.Elsewhere, you can stroll the castle's terraced grounds dipping into various other small chapels and drinking in the views from the Terrazzo degli Ulivi (Olive tree terrace).The complex includes a couple of attractive terrace cafes (the highest one offers views across to Capri), as well as an hotel."

    "detail_description": "In medieval times this part of Cannaregio housed a getto (foundry), but it was as the designated Jewish quarter from the 16th to 19th centuries that the word acquired a whole new meaning. In accordance with the Venetian Republic’s 1516 decree, by day Jewish lenders, doctors and clothing merchants were permitted to attend to Venice's commercial interests, but at night and on Christian holidays they were locked within the gated island of the Ghetto Nuovo (New Foundry).\nWhen Jewish merchants fled the Spanish Inquisition for Venice in 1541, there was no place left in the Ghetto to go but up: in buildings around the Campo del Ghetto Nuovo, upper storeys housed new arrivals, synagogues and publishing houses. A plain wooden cupola in the corner of the campo (square) marks the location of the Schola Canton. Next door is the Schola Tedesca, while the rooftop Schola Italiana is a simple synagogue built by newly arrived and largely destitute Italian Jews, who had fled from Spanish-controlled southern Italy.As numbers grew, the Ghetto was extended into the neighbouring Ghetto Vecchio (Old Foundry), creating the confusing situation where the older Jewish area is called the New Ghetto and the newer is the Old Ghetto. Sephardic Jewish refugees raised two synagogues in Campo del Ghetto Vecchio that are considered among the most beautiful in northern Italy, lavishly rebuilt in the 17th century. The Schola Levantina, founded in 1541, has a magnificent 17th-century woodworked pulpit, while the Schola Spagnola, founded around 1580, shows just how Venetian the community had become through a demonstrated flair for Venetian architectural flourishes: repeating geometric details, high-arched windows, and exuberant marble and carved-wood baroque interiors.After Venice fell to Napoleon in 1787 the city's Jews experienced six months of freedom before the Austrian administration restricted them to the Ghetto once again. It wasn't until Venice joined with Italy in 1866 that full emancipation was gained, but even that was short-lived. Many of Venice's Jews fled before the Nazi occupation, but 246 were arrested and sent to concentration camps between 1943 and 1944; only eight survived. A memorial consisting of harrowing bas-reliefs and the names and ages of those killed now lines two walls facing Campo del Ghetto Nuovo.You can stroll around this peaceful precinct by day and night, but the best way to experience the Ghetto is on a guided tour of three of the synagogues offered by the Museo Ebraico, departing hourly from 10.30am."

    "detail_description": "Originally designed as a hunting lodge for Charles VII of Bourbon, the monumental Palazzo di Capodimonte was begun in 1738 and took more than a century to complete. It's now home to the Museo di Capodimonte, southern Italy's largest and richest art gallery. Its vast collection – much of which Charles inherited from his mother, Elisabetta Farnese – was moved here in 1759 and ranges from exquisite 12th-century altarpieces to works by Botticelli, Caravaggio, Titian and Warhol.\nThe gallery is spread over three floors and 160 rooms; for most people, a full morning or afternoon is enough for an abridged best-of tour. The 1st floor includes works by greats such as Michelangelo, Raphael and Titian, with highlights including Masaccio’s Crocifissione (Crucifixion), Botticelli's Madonna col Bambino e due angeli (Madonna with Child and Angels), Bellini’s Trasfigurazione (Transfiguration) and Parmigianino’s Antea, all of which are subject to room changes within the museum.The floor is also home to the royal apartments, a study in regal excess. The Salottino di Porcellana (Room 52) is an outrageous example of 18th-century chinoiserie, its walls and ceiling dense with whimsically themed porcelain ‘stucco’. Originally created between 1757 and 1759 for the Palazzo Reale in Portici, it was transferred to Capodimonte in 1867.Upstairs, the 2nd-floor galleries display work by Neapolitan artists from the 13th to the 19th centuries, including de Ribera, Giordano, Solimena and Stanzione. It's also home to some spectacular 16th-century Belgian tapestries. The piece that many come to see, however, is Caravaggio’s Flagellazione (Flagellation of Christ; 1607–10), which hangs in reverential solitude in Room 78. Rooms 88 to 95 are dedicated to paintings of the Neapolitan baroque period.Accessed from the 2nd floor, a small mezzanine level hosts a rotating selection of modern works from artists including Andy Warhol, Mimmo Jodice and John Armleder.Once you've finished in the museum, the Real Bosco di Capodimonte – the palace's 134-hectare estate – provides a much-needed breath of fresh air.The museum offers a convenient, hourly shuttle-bus service – Shuttle Capodimonte – that runs between central Naples and the museum. Buses depart from Piazza Trieste e Trento (opposite Teatro San Carlo) and stop at Piazza Dante and the Museo Archeologico Nazionale en route. Tickets (which include museum entry) can be purchased directly on the bus."

    "detail_description": "Sicily's most enthralling archaeological site encompasses the ruined ancient city of Akragas, highlighted by the stunningly well-preserved Tempio della Concordia, one of several ridge-top temples that once served as beacons for homecoming sailors. The 13-sq-km park, 3km south of Agrigento, is split into eastern and western zones. Ticket offices with car parks are at the park's southwestern corner (the main Porta V entrance) and at the northeastern corner near the Temple of Hera (Eastern Entrance).\nEastern ZoneIf you only have time to explore part of the site, make it the eastern zone, where you'll find the three best-preserved temples. The 5th-century-BC Tempio di Hera, is perched on the edge of a ridge. Though partly destroyed by an earthquake in the Middle Ages, much of the colonnade remains intact, as does a long altar, originally used for sacrifices.From here, the path continues westwards, past a gnarled 800-year-old olive tree and a series of Byzantine tombs built into the city walls, to the Tempio della Concordia. This remarkable edifice, the model for Unesco's logo, has survived almost entirely intact since it was constructed in 430 BC. In 1748 the temple was restored to its original form and given the name it's now known by.The last of the zone's temples, the Tempio di Ercole, is the oldest, dating from the end of the 6th century BC. Eight of its 38 columns have been raised and you can wander around the remains of the rest.Down from the main temples, you can see a little temple set on a high base. This is known as the Tomba di Terone, although it dates to 75 BC, about 500 years after the death of Theron, Agrigento's Greek tyrant.Western ZoneThe main feature of the western zone is the crumbled ruin of the Tempio di Giove. Covering an area of 112m by 56m with columns 20m high, this would have been the largest Doric temple ever built had its construction not been interrupted by the Carthaginians sacking Akragas. The incomplete temple was later destroyed by an earthquake.A short hop away, four columns mark the Tempio dei Dioscuri, a 5th-century-BC temple that was destroyed by an earthquake and partially rebuilt in the 19th century. Just behind is a complex of altars and small buildings believed to be part of the 6th-century-BC Santuario delle Divine Chtoniche.In a natural cleft near the sanctuary is the Giardino della Kolymbetra, a lush garden of olive and citrus trees interspersed with more than 300 labelled species of plants and some welcome picnic tables."

Highlights include the Terme di Nettuno (Baths of Neptune), a steeply stacked amphitheatre, some exquisite mosaics and an ancient cafe, complete with traces of its original menu.Note that the site is huge and you'll need a few hours to do it justice. Also, it gets busy at weekends but is much quieter on weekdays.\nTo help with navigation, it's worth arming yourself with a site map, which you can buy for €2 at the ticket office. Audio guides are also available for €5.Just beyond the ticket office, Porta Romana gives onto the Decumanus Maximus, the site's central drag, which runs over 1km to Porta Marina, the city's original sea-facing gate. At the time of research, however, it was blocked off about two-thirds of the way down, by the Tempio dei Fabri Navales.On the Decumanus, the Terme di Nettuno is a must-see. This baths complex, one of 20 that originally stood in town, dates from the 2nd century and boasts some superb mosaics, including one of Neptune riding a seahorse chariot. In the centre of the complex are the remains of an arcaded palestra (gym).Near the Terme is the Teatro, an amphitheatre originally built at the end of the 1st century BC by Agrippa and later enlarged to hold 4000 people.The grassy area behind the amphitheatre is the Piazzale delle Corporazioni (Forum of the Corporations), home to the offices of Ostia's merchant guilds. The mosaics that line the perimeter – ships, dolphins, a lighthouse, elephants – are thought to have represented the businesses housed on the square: ships and dolphins indicated shipping agencies, while elephants probably signalled businesses involved in the ivory trade.Further down the Decumanus, the Forum, Ostia's main square, is overlooked by what remains of the Capitolium, a temple built by Hadrian and dedicated to Jupiter, Juno and Minerva.Nearby is another highlight: the Thermopolium, an ancient cafe, complete with bar, fragments of its original frescoed menu, and a small courtyard where customers would have relaxed around a fountain. To the north of this are two of the so-called case decorate. These frescoed houses are off limits to unaccompanied visitors but can be entered on a free guided tour at 10.30am each Sunday – see the website for booking details.Over on the other side of the Decumanus are the remains of the 2nd-century Terme del Foro, originally the city's largest and most important baths complex. Here, in the forica (public toilet), you can see 20 well-preserved latrines set sociably in a long stone bench.For more modern facilities, you'll find a cafeteria, toilets and a gift shop to the north of the Decumanus (head up Via dei Molini). Also here is a small museum displaying statues and sarcophagi excavated on the site."

    "detail_description": "The Jewish Ghetto, centered on lively Via del Portico d’Ottavia, is an atmospheric area studded with artisan's studios, small shops, kosher bakeries and popular trattorias. Crowning everything is the distinctive square dome of Rome's main synagogue.\nHistory\nRome’s Jewish community dates back to the 2nd century BCE, making it one of the oldest in Europe. Historic documents dating as far back as 161 BCE, show that Jews of Palestine asked Rome for protection against the attacks of Hellenistic King Antiochus IV Epiphanes in Judea and Samaria. The alliance led to the first major migration flow – the Jewish population in Rome would grow to reach 40,000 in less than a century. Many more Jews arrived as slaves following the Roman wars in Judaea and Titus' defeat of Jerusalem in 70 CE.\nRepression occured early on. Emperor Constantine (306 to 337 CE) prohibited Jews from using public offices or serving in the military. In 1215, Pope Innocent III forced Jews to wear a yellow or blue mark in public to be identifiable.\nConfinement to the Ghetto came in 1555 when Pope Paul IV introduced a law that obligated the Jewish community to live in a walled quarter, whose two gates were locked at night. The period of official intolerance that lasted on and off until the 20th century, with waves of hatred, violence and discrimination happening until the end of the fascist era in the late 1940s.\nIronically, though, confinement meant that the Jewish cultural and religious identity survived intact to this day.\n\n  \nVia Portico d'Ottavia in Rome's Jewish Ghetto is a major culinary destination © Getty Images\n\nEating in the Jewish Ghetto\nRome’s Jewish Ghetto has become a culinary destination where both locals and visitors can experience dishes that are prepared according to ancient traditions here and nowhere else. The signature dish of Judeo-Roman cuisine is the carciofo alla giuda (fried artichoke), found in every restaurant on Via Porto d’Ottavia and surroundings. Kashruth rigidly prohibits the consumption of meat and milk together, so apart from a few shared vegetarian delicacies, restaurants’ menus vary, serving either one or the other.\nBa’Ghetto, one of the oldest Jewish restaurants in Rome, has solved the problem of milk-meat contamination by opening three restaurants on Via Porto d’Ottavia – Ba’Ghetto, Ba’Ghetto Milky and Su’Ghetto, specializing in kosher Italian dishes. Nonna Betta and Bellacarne are great alternatives.\nWhen it comes to sweets, the historic Pasticceria Boccione is worth the queue – the bakery’s torta ricotta e visciole, a cake filled with sweet ricotta cheese and sour cherries made following a 50-year-old recipe – has acquired legendary status in Rome.\n\n  \nBrass cobblestones are placed outside the homes of Holocaust victims © Getty Images\n\nTips and other practicalities\nAs you stroll around look out for a series of brass cobblestones. These are memorial plaques commemorating the city's Holocaust victims: each one names a person and gives the date and destination of their deportation and death. They are placed outside the victims' homes.\nTo learn more about the history of the Jewish community in Rome, visit the Museo Ebraico di Roma, found inside the Great Synagogue, where seven galleries trace the story of the Ghetto through a collection of nearly 1500 objects and documents.\n"

    "detail_description": "Naples' oldest and most sacred catacombs became a Christian pilgrimage site when San Gennaro's body was interred here in the 5th century. The carefully restored site allows visitors to experience an evocative other world of tombs, corridors and broad vestibules, its treasures including 2nd-century Christian frescoes, 5th-century mosaics and the oldest known portrait of San Gennaro, dating from the second half of the 5th century.\nThe catacombs are home to three types of tomb, each corresponding to a specific social class. The wealthy opted for the open-room cubiculum, originally guarded by gates and adorned with colourful wall frescoes. One cubiculum to the left of the entrance features an especially beautiful funerary fresco of a mother, father and child: it's made up of three layers of fresco, one commissioned for each death. The smaller, rectangular wall niches, known as loculum, were the domain of the middle classes, while the forme (floor tombs) were reserved for the poor.Further ahead you'll stumble upon the basilica minore (minor basilica), home to the tombs of San Gennaro and 5th-century archbishop of Naples Giovanni I. Sometime between 413 and 431, Giovanni I accompanied the martyr's remains from Pozzuoli to Naples, burying them here before Lombard prince Sico I of Benevento snatched them in the 9th century. The basilica minore also harbours fragments of a fresco depicting Naples' first bishop, Sant'Aspreno. The city's bishops were buried here until the 11th century.Close to the basilica minore is a 3rd-century tomb whose Pompeiian-hued artwork employs both Christian and pagan elements. In the image of three women building a castle, the figures represent the three virtues, while the castle symbolises the Church.The lower level is even older, dating back to the 2nd century and speckled with typically pagan motifs like fruit and animals. The painting on the side of San Gennaro's tomb – depicting the saint with Mt Vesuvius and Mt Somma in the background – is the first known image of San Gennaro as the protector of Naples. Also on the lower level is the Basilica di Agrippino, named in honour of Sant'Agrippino. The sixth bishop of Naples, Agrippino was also the first Christian to be buried in the catacombs, back in the 3rd century.Tours of the catacombs are run by the Cooperativa Sociale Onlus 'La Paranza', whose ticket office is to the left of the Chiesa di Madre di Buon Consiglio, a snack-sized replica of St Peter's in Rome completed in 1960. Tickets can also be purchased in advance online.The cooperative also runs a fascinating Sunday morning walking tour called Il Miglio Sacro (The Holy Mile; adult/reduced €15/13), which explores the neighbouring Sanità district. The Holy Mile tour must be prebooked and is offered in Italian unless requested in English, French or Spanish in advance; see the website for details.The catacombs themselves also host occasional special events, including theatrical and live-music performances; see the website."

    "detail_description": "A feast of geometric patterns, ziggurat crenellations, maiolica cupolas and blind arches, Palermo's cathedral has suffered aesthetically from multiple reworkings over the centuries, but remains a prime example of Sicily's unique Arab-Norman architectural style. The interior, while impressive in scale, is essentially a marble shell whose most interesting features are the royal Norman tombs (to the left as you enter), the treasury (home to Constance of Aragon's gem-encrusted 13th-century crown) and the panoramic views from the roof.\nConstruction began in 1184 at the behest of Palermo's archbishop, Walter of the Mill (Gualtiero Offamiglio), an Englishman who was tutor to William II. Walter held great power and had unlimited funds at his disposal, but with the building of the magnificent cathedral at Monreale he felt his power diminishing. His solution was to order construction of an equally magnificent cathedral in Palermo. This was erected on the location of a 9th-century mosque (itself built on a former chapel); a detail from the mosque's original decor is visible at the southern porch, where a column is inscribed with a passage from the Koran. The cathedral's proportions and the grandeur of its exterior became a statement of the power struggle between Church and throne occurring at the time, a potentially dangerous situation that was tempered by Walter's death (in 1191), which prevented him from seeing (and boasting about) the finished building.Since then the cathedral has been much altered, sometimes with great success (as in Antonio Gambara's 15th-century three-arched portico that took 200 years to complete and became a masterpiece of Catalan Gothic architecture), and sometimes with less fortunate results (as in Ferdinando Fuga's clumsy dome, added between 1781 and 1801). Thankfully Fuga's handiwork did not extend to the eastern exterior, which is still adorned with the exotic interlacing designs of Walter's original cathedral. The southwestern facade was laid in the 13th and 14th centuries, and is a beautiful example of local craftsmanship in the Gothic style. The cathedral's entrance – through Gambara's three magnificent arches – is fronted by gardens and a statue of Santa Rosalia, one of Palermo's patron saints. A beautiful painted intarsia decoration above the arches depicts the tree of life in a complex Islamic-style geometric composition of 12 roundels that show fruit, humans and all kinds of animals. It's thought to date back to 1296.To the left as you enter the cathedral, the Monumental Area harbours several royal Norman tombs, which contain the remains of two of Sicily's greatest rulers: Roger II (rear left) and Frederick II of Hohenstaufen (front left), as well as Henry VI and William II. The cathedral's treasury houses a small collection of Norman-era jewels and religious relics. Most extraordinary is the fabulous 13th-century crown of Constance of Aragon (wife of Frederick II), made by local craftsmen in fine gold filigree and encrusted with gems. More bizarre treasures include the tooth and ashes of Santa Rosalia, kept here in silver reliquaries."

    "detail_description": "Holding pride of place on the waterfront, this pretty Gothic confection may be an unlikely setting for the political and administrative seat of a great republic, but it's an exquisitely Venetian one. Beyond its dainty colonnades and geometrically patterned facade of white Istrian stone and pale pink Veronese marble lie grand rooms of state, the doge's private apartments and a large complex of council chambers, courts and prisons.\nThe doge's official residence probably moved to this site in the 10th century, although the current complex only started to take shape around 1340. In 1424 the wing facing the piazzetta was added and the palace assumed its final form, give or take a few major fires and refurbishments.A standard ticket allows you access to the grand central courtyard, a display of historic masonry (Museo dell'Opera) on the ground floor and a circuit of the main part of the palace that leads through the state rooms, armoury, prisons and institutional rooms. The Doge's Apartments are now used for temporary art exhibitions, which are ticketed separately (around €10 extra). Further rooms, too small for the masses, can be visited on the 75-minute Secret Itineraries Tour.The most impressive parts of the palace are at the top. Ascend Sansovino’s 24-carat gilt stucco-work Scala d’Oro (Golden Staircase) and emerge into rooms covered with gorgeous propaganda. In the Palladio-designed Sala delle Quattro Porte (Hall of the Four Doors), ambassadors awaited ducal audiences under a lavish display of Venice's virtues by Giovanni Cambi, Titian and Tiepolo.Few were granted an audience in the Palladio-designed Collegio (Council Room), where Veronese’s 1575–78 Virtues of the Republic ceiling shows Venice as a bewitching blonde figure waving her sceptre like a wand over Justice and Peace. Father-son team Jacopo and Domenico Tintoretto attempt similar flattery, showing Venice keeping company with Apollo, Mars and Mercury in their Triumph of Venice ceiling for the Sala del Senato (Senate Hall).Government cover-ups were never so appealing as in the Sala Consiglio dei Dieci (Chamber of the Council of Ten), where Venice’s star chamber plotted beneath Veronese’s Juno Bestowing Her Gifts on Venice, depicting a glowing goddess strewing gold ducats. Above the slot where anonymous treason accusations were slipped into the Sala della Bussola (Compass Room) is his St Mark in Glory ceiling.The cavernous 1419 Sala del Maggior Consiglio (Grand Council Hall) provides the setting for Domenico Tintoretto's swirling Paradise, a work that’s more politically correct than pretty: heaven is crammed with 500 prominent Venetians, including several Tintoretto patrons. Veronese’s political posturing is more elegant in his oval Apotheosis of Venice ceiling, where gods marvel at Venice’s coronation by angels, with foreign dignitaries and blonde Venetians rubbernecking on the balcony below."

Michelangelo's ceiling design, which is best viewed from the chapel’s main entrance in the far east wall, covers the entire 800-sq-m surface.\nWith painted architectural features and a cast of colorful biblical characters, it's centered on nine panels depicting stories from the book of Genesis. These panels can further be divided into three groups, illustrating the origin of man, the universe and evil.\n\n  \nThe Creation of Adam is one of the most famous images in Western art © legacy1995 / Shutterstock\n\nAs you look up from the east wall, the first panel is the Drunkenness of Noah, followed by The Flood, and the Sacrifice of Noah. Next, Original Sin and Banishment from the Garden of Eden famously depicts Adam and Eve being sent packing after accepting the forbidden fruit from Satan, represented by a snake with the body of a woman coiled around a tree. The Creation of Eve is then followed by the Creation of Adam. This, one of the most famous images in Western art, shows a bearded God pointing his finger at Adam, thus bringing him to life. Completing the sequence are the Separation of Land from Sea; the Creation of the Sun, Moon and Plants; and the Separation of Light from Darkness, featuring a fearsome God reaching out to touch the sun. Set around the central panels are 20 athletic male nudes, known as ignudi.\nOpposite, on the west wall is Michelangelo’s mesmeric Giudizio Universale, showing Christ – in the center near the top – passing sentence over the souls of the dead as they are torn from their graves to face him. The saved get to stay up in heaven (in the upper right), the damned are sent down to face the demons in hell (in the bottom right).\nNear the bottom, on the right, you’ll see a man with donkey ears and a snake wrapped around him. This is Biagio de Cesena, the papal master of ceremonies, who was a fierce critic of Michelangelo’s composition. Another famous figure is St Bartholomew, just beneath Christ, holding his own flayed skin. The face in the skin is said to be a self-portrait of Michelangelo, its anguished look reflecting the artist’s tormented faith.\nThe chapel’s walls also boast superb frescoes. Painted in 1481–82 by a crack team of Renaissance artists, including Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Pinturicchio, Perugino and Luca Signorelli, they represent events in the lives of Moses (to the left looking at the Giudizio Universale) and Christ (to the right). Highlights include Botticelli’s Temptations of Christ and Perugino’s Handing over of the Keys.\nAs well as providing a showcase for priceless art, the Sistine Chapel also serves an important religious function as the place where the conclave meets to elect a new pope.\nTips and other practicalities\nThe Sistine Chapel is part of the Vatican Museums, which can be visited from Monday to Saturday, plus the last Sunday of every month. Single adult tickets start at €27.50 and rise if you choose to join a guided tour. Given the popularity of the Vatican Museum it’s recommended to book your tickets in advance via the official website. Taking photos and videos in the Sistine Chapel is not allowed.\n"

    "detail_description": "Venice's historic gallery traces the development of Venetian art from the 14th to 19th centuries, with works by all of the city's artistic superstars. The complex housing the collection maintained its serene composure for centuries until Napoleon installed his haul of art trophies here in 1807 – looted from various religious institutions around town. Since then there’s been nonstop visual drama on its walls. Note that the gallery is in the midst of a major refurbishment; some rooms may be closed.\nThe Accademia inhabits three conjoined buildings. The Scuola della Carità (founded 1260) was the oldest of Venice's six scuole grandi (religious confraternities); the current building dates to 1343. Bartolomeo Bon completed the spare, Gothic-edged facade of the Chiesa di Santa Maria della Carità in 1448. A century later, Palladio took a classical approach to the Convento dei Canonici Lateranensi. From 1949 to 1954, Carlo Scarpa chose a minimalist approach to restorations. The bulk of the collection's treasures are on the 1st floor, and this is the best place to start your visit. The ground floor houses major exhibitions, sculpture and a less showstopping collection of paintings from 1600 to 1880.Take the stairs up from the grand entry hall and prepare to be overwhelmed by the sensory overload of Room 1, where a swarm of angels flutter their golden wings from the carved ceiling, gazing down upon a swirling polychrome marble floor. Competing valiantly for your attention are a collection of vivid 14th- and 15th-century religious works that show Venice's precocious flair for colour and drama.Room 20 is full of large canvases taken from the Scuola Grande di San Giovanni Evangelista. Gentile Bellini's Procession in Piazza San Marco offers an intriguing view of Venice's most famous square before its 16th-century makeover, while the former wooden version of the city's most famous bridge appears in Vittore Carpaccio's Miracle of the Reliquary of the Cross at Rialto Bridge.The former church (Room 23) is a serene showstopper fronted by a Bellini altarpiece. Sharing the space is Giorgione’s highly charged The Storm. The rear of the church displays massive canvases looted from the Scuola Grande di San Marco.The Sala dell’Albergo (Room 24) has been left untouched from when it was the Scuola della Carità's boardroom. Meetings would not have been boring here, under a lavishly carved ceiling and facing Antonio Vivarini's Madonna Enthroned with Child in the Heavenly Garden, filled with fluffy-bearded saints. Titian closes the 1st-floor circuit with his touching Presentation of the Virgin. Here, a young, tiny Madonna trudges up an intimidating staircase while a distinctly Venetian crowd of onlookers point at her.To dodge the high-season queues, you're best to arrive at opening time or towards the end of the day. The last entry is 45 minutes before closing, but a proper visit takes at least 1½ hours. Otherwise, book timed tickets in advance online (booking fee €1.50). There's free admission to the gallery on the first Sunday of each month."

    "detail_description": "The high point (quite literally) of the Neapolitan baroque, this charterhouse-turned-museum was built as a Carthusian monastery between 1325 and 1368. Centred on one of the most beautiful cloisters in Italy, it has been decorated, adorned and altered over the centuries by some of Italy’s finest talent, most importantly architect Giovanni Antonio Dosio in the 16th century and baroque sculptor Cosimo Fanzago a century later. Nowadays, it’s a superb repository of Neapolitan and Italian artistry.\nThe monastery’s church and the sacristy, treasury and chapter house that flank it contain a feast of frescoes and paintings by some of Naples’ greatest 17th-century artists, among them Battista Caracciolo, Jusepe de Ribera, Guido Reni and Massimo Stanzione. In the nave, Cosimo Fanzago’s inlaid marble work is simply extraordinary.Adjacent to the church, the Chiostro dei Procuratori is the smaller of the monastery’s two cloisters. A grand corridor on the left leads to the larger Chiostro Grande (Great Cloister). Originally designed by Dosio in the late 16th century and added to by Fanzago, it’s a sublime composition of Tuscan-Doric porticoes, marble statues and vibrant camellias. The balustrade marks the Certosa's small cemetery, adorned with skulls created by Fanzago.Just off the Chiostro dei Procuratori, the Sezione Navale documents the history of the Bourbon navy from 1734 to 1860, and features a small yet extraordinary collection of royal barges. The Sezione Presepiale – which faces the refectory – houses a whimsical collection of rare Neapolitan presepi (nativity scenes) from the 18th and 19th centuries, including the colossal 19th-century Cuciniello creation, which covers one wall of what used to be the monastery’s kitchen. The Quarto del Priore in the southern wing houses the bulk of the monks' historic picture collection, as well as one of the museum’s most famous sculptures, the tender Madonna col Bambino e San Giovannino (Madonna and Child with the Infant John the Baptist). The piece is the work of Pietro Bernini, father of the more famous Gian Lorenzo Bernini. Also noteworthy is a statue of St Francis of Assisi by 18th-century master sculptor Giuseppe Sanmartino, creator of the Cristo velato (Veiled Christ) housed in Naples' Cappella Sansevero.A pictorial history of Naples is told in Immagini e Memorie della Città e del Regno (Images and Memories of the City and Kingdom of Naples). Here you’ll find portraits of historic characters; antique maps, including a 35-panel copper map of 18th-century Naples in Room 45; and rooms dedicated to major historical events such as the eruption of Mt Vesuvius and the Revolt of the Masaniello (Room 36) and the plague (Room 37). Room 32 boasts the beautiful Tavola Strozzi (Strozzi Table); its fabled depiction of maritime Naples in the second half of the 15th century is one of the city’s most celebrated historical records.It's worth noting that some sections of the museum are only open at various times of the day; see the website for specific times.Below the Certosa is the imposing Sotterranei Gotici (Gothic basement). The austere vaulted space holds around 150 marble sculptures and epigraphs. Unfortunately, tours were suspended indefinitely in 2017; contact the museum for updates."

    "detail_description": "Naples' National Archaeological Museum serves up one of the world’s finest collections of Graeco-Roman artefacts. Originally a cavalry barracks and later seat of the city’s university, the museum was established by the Bourbon king Charles VII in the late 18th century to house the antiquities he inherited from his mother, Elisabetta Farnese, as well as treasures looted from Pompeii and Herculaneum. Star exhibits include the celebrated Toro Farnese (Farnese Bull) sculpture and awe-inspiring mosaics from Pompeii's Casa del Fauno.\nBefore tackling the collection, consider investing in the National Archaeological Museum of Naples (€12), published by Electa; if you want to concentrate on the highlights, audio guides (€5) are available in English.Downstairs is an impressive collection of ancient epigraphs (stone engravings), among them slogans from Pompeiian political campaigns and examples of local street poetry. Some of the engravings pre-date Roman rule, spanning back to the southern Italy's Greek domination. The basement is also home to Italy's second-largest collection of ancient Egyptian relics, organised around themes such as 'Tombs and Grave Goods', 'Mummification and Magic'.The ground-floor Farnese collection of colossal Greek and Roman sculptures features the Toro Farnese and a muscle-bound Ercole (Hercules). Sculpted in the early 3rd century AD and noted in the writings of Pliny the Elder, the Toro Farnese, probably a Roman copy of a Greek original, depicts the humiliating death of Dirce, Queen of Thebes. Carved from a single colossal block of marble, the sculpture was discovered in 1545 at the Baths of Caracalla in Rome and was restored by Michelangelo, before eventually being shipped to Naples in 1788. Ercole was discovered in the same Roman excavations, albeit without his legs. Replacement pins were commissioned by Michelangelo and sculpted by Guglielmo della Porta. When the statue's original legs were found, the Farnese family decided not to have them fitted, but they were reinstated when the statue was gifted to the King of Naples.If you’re short on time, take in both these masterpieces before heading straight to the mezzanine floor, home to an exquisite collection of mosaics, mostly from Pompeii. Of the series taken from the Casa del Fauno, it is La battaglia di Alessandro contro Dario (The Battle of Alexander against Darius) that really stands out. The best-known depiction of Alexander the Great, the 20-sq-metre mosaic was probably made by Alexandrian craftsmen working in Italy around the end of the 2nd century BC.Beyond the mosaics, the Gabinetto Segreto (Secret Chamber) contains a small but much-studied collection of ancient erotica. Pan is caught in the act with a nanny goat in the collection’s most famous piece – a small and surprisingly sophisticated statue taken from the Villa dei Papiri in Herculaneum. You'll also find a series of nine paintings depicting erotic positions – a menu for brothel patrons.Originally the royal library, the enormous Sala Meridiana (Great Hall of the Sundial) on the 1st floor is home to the Atlante farnese, a statue of Atlas carrying a globe on his shoulders, as well as various paintings from the Farnese collection. Look up and you’ll find Pietro Bardellino’s riotously colourful 1781 fresco depicting the (short-lived) triumph of Ferdinand IV of Bourbon and Marie Caroline of Austria in Rome.The rest of the 1st floor is largely devoted to fascinating discoveries from Pompeii, Herculaneum, Boscoreale, Stabiae and Cuma. Among them are whimsical wall frescoes from the Villa di Agrippa Postumus and the Casa di Meleagro, extraordinary bronzes from the Villa dei Papiri, and ceramics, glassware, engraved coppers and Greek funerary vases."

    "detail_description": "Entered via the Palazzo Pubblico's Cortile del Podestà (Courtyard of the Chief Magistrate), this wonderful museum showcases rooms richly frescoed by artists of the Sienese school. Commissioned by the city's governing body rather than by the Church, some of the frescoes depict secular subjects – highly unusual at the time. The highlights are two huge frescoes: Ambrogio Lorenzetti's Allegories of Good and Bad Government (c 1338–40) and Simone Martini's celebrated Maestà (Virgin Mary in Majesty; 1315).\nAfter buying your ticket, head upstairs to the Sala del Risorgimento, where late-19th-century frescoes serialise key events in the Risorgimento (reunification period). Continue through to the Sala di Balìa (Military Court), where frescoes by father and son Spinello and Parri Aretino recount episodes in the life of Pope Alexander III (the Sienese Rolando Bandinelli), including his clashes with the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. Straight ahead is the Sala del Concistoro (Hall of the Council of Clergymen), dominated by the allegorical ceiling frescoes (1529–35) by the Mannerist painter Domenico (di Pace) Beccafumi. Through a vestibule to the left are the Anticappella (Chapel entrance hall) and Cappella (Chapel). The Anticappella features frescoes painted in 1415 by Taddeo di Bartolo. These include figures representing the virtues needed for the proper exercise of power (Justice, Magnanimity, Strength, Prudence, Religion), and depictions of some of the leading Republican lights of ancient Rome. The Cappella contains a fine wooden choir and a fresco of the Holy Family and St Leonard by Giovanni Antonio Bazzi (aka Il Sodoma). Next to the Anticappella is the Vestibolo (Vestibule), whose star attraction is a bronze wolf, the symbol of the city.The vestibule leads into the Sala del Mappamondo (Hall of the World Map), which houses Simone Martini's powerful and striking Maestà. This depicts the Madonna beneath a canopy surrounded by saints and angels, and is one of Martini's first known works, painted when he was only 21 years old. On the other side of the room is Martini's oft-reproduced fresco (1328–30) of Guidoriccio da Fogliano, a captain of the Sienese army. Also here is The Conquest of the Giuncarico Castle, attributed to Duccio (di Boninsegna) and painted in the early 14th century.The next room, the Sala dei Pace, is where the ruling Council of Nine once met. It's decorated with Ambrogio Lorenzetti's fascinating fresco cycle, the Allegories of Good and Bad Government (c 1338–39), often described as the most important secular painting of the Renaissance. The central allegory portrays scenes with personifications of Justice, Wisdom, Virtue and Peace, all unusually depicted as women, along with scenes of criminal punishment and rewards for righteousness. Set perpendicular from it are the frescoes Allegory of Good Government and Allegory of Bad Government, which feature intensely contrasting scenes clearly set around Siena. The good depicts a sunlit, idyllic, serene city, with joyous citizens and a countryside filled with crops; the bad city is filled with vices, crime and disease.Before leaving the museum, be sure to visit the recently restored Loggia dei Nove at the rear of the building, which commands a panoramic view to the Orto de’ Pecci and the south of the city."

    "detail_description": "Consecrated on the former site of a Roman temple in 1179 and constructed over the 13th and 14th centuries, Siena's majestic duomo (cathedral) showcases the talents of many great medieval and Renaissance architects and artists: Giovanni Pisano designed the intricate white, green and red marble facade; Nicola Pisano carved the elaborate pulpit; Pinturicchio painted the frescoes in the extraordinary Libreria Piccolomini; and Michelangelo, Donatello and Gian Lorenzo Bernini all produced sculptures.\nThis triumph of Romanesque-Gothic architecture has a truly stunning interior. Walls and pillars continue the exterior's striped theme, while the vaults are painted blue with gold stars. The intricate floor is inlaid with 56 panels depicting historical and biblical scenes executed by about 40 artists over 200 years from the 14th century on. The older rectangular panels, including the Wheel of Fortune (1372) and The She-Wolf of Siena with the Emblems of the Confederate Cities (1373), are graffiti designs by unknown artists. Domenico di Niccoló (dei Cori) was the first known artist to work on the cathedral, contributing several panels between 1413 and 1423, followed by renowned painter Domenico di Bartolo, who contributed Emperor Sigismund Enthroned in 1434. In the 15th century, director Alberto Aringhieri and celebrated Sienese artist Domenico (di Pace) Beccafumi created the dramatic expansion of the floor scheme. These later panels feature more advanced multicoloured marble, inlaid with hexagon and rhombus frames. Unfortunately, many panels are covered for much of the year, only being revealed between mid-August and late October, when ticket prices increase and opening hours on Sundays are extended (9.30am-5.30pm). During this time, it's a good idea to pre-purchase tickets online, which will allow you to skip often long queues.Other drawcards include the exquisitely crafted marble-and-porphyry pulpit created by Nicola Pisano, assisted by his son Giovanni and Arnolfo di Cambio, who later designed Florence's duomo. Intricately carved with vigorous, realistic crowd scenes, it's one of the masterpieces of Gothic sculpture. Over from the pulpit to the right of the transept, the Cappella del Voto harbours two marble statues of St Jerome and Mary Magdalene by baroque maestro Gian Lorenzo Bernini.Donatello's famous bronze St John the Baptist headlines in the Cappella di San Giovanni Battista, next to the Libreria Piccolomini. This enchanting library, accessible through a door from the north aisle, was built to house the books of Enea Silvio Piccolomini, better known as Pius II. The walls of the small hall are decorated with vividly coloured narrative frescoes painted between 1502 and 1507 by Pinturicchio (Bernardino di Betto), depicting events in the life of Piccolomini. Nearby, on the Piccolomini altar, you can admire four saintly sculptures by the young Michelangelo. Some art historians believe that the sculpture St Paul is in fact a self-portrait of Michelangelo, with the broken-looking nose referencing the injury that fellow sculptor Pietro Torrigiano inflicted on him out of jealousy when both were honing their art in Florence.The duomo could have been grander still: in 1339 the city's medieval rulers drew up plans to build an immense new nave and have the present church become its transept. If the project had gone ahead, Siena would have been the proud possessor of one of Italy's biggest churches. However, it wasn't to be. The devastating plague of 1348 put a stop to work and all that remains of the Duomo Nuovo (New Cathedral) is its massive unfinished facade on the eastern side of the cathedral, which can be accessed through the Museo dell'Opera.Entry to the duomo and Libreria Piccolomini is included in the OPA SI and Acropoli passes."

    "detail_description": "With a profusion of domes and more than 8000 sq metres of luminous mosaics, Venice's cathedral is unforgettable. It was founded in the 9th century to house the corpse of St Mark after wily Venetian merchants smuggled it out of Egypt in a barrel of pork fat. When the original building burnt down in 932 Venice rebuilt the basilica in its own cosmopolitan image, with Byzantine domes, a Greek cross layout and walls clad in marble from Syria, Egypt and Palestine.\nUnbelievably, this sumptuous church was the doge's private chapel. It only officially became Venice's cathedral in 1807 following the demise of the Republic, replacing the considerably less grand Basilica di San Pietro in Castello.The front of St Mark's ripples and crests like a wave, its five niched portals capped with shimmering mosaics and frothy stonework arches. It's especially resplendent just before sunset, when the sun's dying rays set the golden mosaics ablaze. The oldest mosaic on the facade, dating from 1270, is in the lunette above the far-left portal, depicting St Mark’s stolen body arriving at the basilica. The theme is echoed in three of the other lunettes, including the 1660 mosaics above the second portal from the right, showing turbaned officials recoiling from the hamper of pork fat containing the sainted corpse. Grand entrances are made through the central portal, under an ornate triple arch featuring Egyptian purple porphyry columns and intricate 13th- to 14th-century stone reliefs.Blinking is natural upon your first glimpse of the basilica's glittering ceiling mosaics, many made with 24-carat gold leaf fused onto the back of the glass to represent divine light. Just inside the vestibule are the basilica's oldest mosaics: Apostles with the Madonna, standing sentry by the main door for more than 950 years. Inside the church proper, three golden domes vie for your attention. The images are intended to be read from the altar end to the entry, so the first dome you see is actually the last: the Pentecost Cupola, with the Holy Spirit represented by a dove shooting tongues of flame onto the heads of the surrounding saints. In the central 13th-century Ascension Cupola, angels swirl around the central figure of Christ hovering among the stars.The Cupola of the Prophets is best seen from behind the main altar, which houses the simple sarcophagus containing St Mark's body. But the main reason visitors pay €2 to enter this space is to see the stupendous Pala d’Oro, a gold altarpiece studded with 2000 emeralds, amethysts, sapphires, rubies, pearls and other gemstones. The screen's most priceless treasures, however, are biblical figures in vibrant cloisonné, begun in Constantinople in AD 976 and embellished by Venetian goldsmiths in 1209. The enamelled saints have wild, unkempt beards and wide eyes fixed on Jesus.Other holy bones and booty from the Crusades fill the Tesoro (treasury; admission €3) and there are more treasures on show in the museum upstairs, accessed from the vestibule. A highlight is the Quadriga of St Mark's (also known as the Triumphal Quadriga), a group of four bronze horses plundered from Constantinople and later carted off to Paris by Napoleon before being returned to the basilica. The originals are now kept inside, but a door leads out to where they were originally placed on the Loggia dei Cavalli, where reproductions of the horses gallop off the balcony over Piazza San Marco.There's no charge to enter the church and wander around the roped-off central circuit, although between April and October you can purchase 'Skip the Line' tickets for €3 (children under 5 enter free of charge). You'll need to dress modestly (ie knees and shoulders covered) and leave large bags around the corner at the Ateneo San Basso Left Luggage Office. Those simply wishing to pray or attend Mass can enter from the Porta dei Fiori, on the north side of the church."

    "detail_description": "Nestled in a quiet corner of Trastevere's focal square, this is said to be the oldest church dedicated to the Virgin Mary in Rome. In its original form, it dates from the early 3rd century, but a major 12th-century makeover saw the addition of a Romanesque bell tower and a glittering facade. The portico came later, added by Carlo Fontana in 1702. Inside, the 12th-century mosaics are the headline feature.\n\n  \nThis historic church is best visited in the morning when it's less crowded Visit © Catarina Belova / Shutterstock\n\nLook out for the six 13th-century mosaics by Pietro Cavallini illustrating the life of the Virgin (c 1291) and the painting known as the Madonna della Clemenza. While its author remains unknown, scholars believe the panel could have been produced between the 6th and the 8th century, which would make it one of the world’s oldest surviving Marian icons.\nAccording to legend, the church stands on the spot where a fountain of oil miraculously sprang from the ground in 32 BCE. It incorporates 24 ancient Roman columns, some plundered from the Terme di Caracalla, and boasts a 17th-century wooden ceiling.\nTips and other practicalities\nThe Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere is located in the heart of the bustling Trastevere neighborhood and is open every day from 7:30am to 8:30pm. Access is free but it can get busy, so it’s best to visit early in the morning to avoid crowds.\n"

Built as a mausoleum for the emperor Hadrian, it was converted into a papal fortress in the 6th century and named after an angelic vision that Pope Gregory the Great had in 590. Nowadays, it is a moody and dramatic keep that houses the Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo and its grand collection of paintings, sculpture, military memorabilia and medieval firearms.\nMany of these weapons were used by soldiers fighting to protect the castle, which, thanks to a 13th-century secret passageway to the Vatican (Passetto di Borgo), provided sanctuary to many popes in times of danger. Most famously, Pope Clemente VI holed up here during the 1527 sack of Rome.\nThe castle's upper floors are filled with elegant Renaissance interiors, including the lavish Sala Paolina with frescoes depicting episodes from the life of Alexander the Great. Two storeys up, the terrace, immortalized by Puccini in his opera Tosca, offers unforgettable views over Rome and has a busy little cafe (snacks €2.50 to €5).\n\n  \nDon't miss the views from the top floor of Castel Sant'Angelo © Arturo Duran / 500px\n\nTips and other practicalities\nTickets to Castel Sant’Angelo cost €13 and allow access to exhibits spread across seven floors, including the historic underground prisons built under the orders of Pope Alexander VI and the Museo Nazionale featuring collections of medieval ceramics, ancient weaponry, and sculptures. Don't miss the spectacular views of the city from the top floor.\nCastel Sant’Angelo is closed on Mondays. Ticket prices may increase during temporary exhibitions.\nSpanning the Tiber river in front of the castle is the five-arched Ponte Sant’Angelo on whose sides 10 marble angels built by prominent artists stand, creating a picturesque frame around Castel Sant’Angelo, (best photographed in the early morning). Two of the angels – the Angel with the Crown of Thorns and the Angel with the Superscription – are copies of Gian Lorenzo Bernini’s works that once stood here. The originals are exhibited at the Sant'Andrea delle Fratte basilica.\nRestaurants and bars nearby\nFor an aperitivo or late night cocktail head to Freeda, a little bar hidden on a side street steps away from Castel Sant’Angelo serving tasty drinks and charcuterie boards. For a plate of pasta served directly in the pan, cross the bridge and take a seat at one of the outdoor tables of La Fraschetta di Castel Sant’Angelo overlooking the castle.\n"

Find them in the Cappella Contarelli to the left of the main altar.\nThese three canvases are among the earliest of Caravaggio's religious works, painted between 1600 and 1602, but they are inescapably his, featuring a down-to-earth realism and the stunning use of chiaroscuro (the bold contrast of light and dark).\n\n  \nTen chapels at Chiesa di San Luigi dei Francesi contain works by renowned artists © photogolfer / Shutterstock\n\nHistory\nWhile Pope Sixtus IV gave Rome’s French community permission to build a church as early as 1478, works to erect the structure between the Pantheon and Piazza Navona began only in 1518. The structure – named after St Louis, as a tribute to the French King – would take over 70 years to be completed, although the frescoes that adorn its interior would appear much later.\nTips and other practicalities\nBehind the travertine facade designed by Giacomo della Porta, ten chapels contain works by renowned artists, including none other than Caravaggio. Before you leave the church, take a moment to enjoy Domenichino’s faded 17th-century frescoes of St Cecilia in the second chapel on the right.

The ground and 1st floors are devoted to sculpture, with some breathtaking pieces – don't miss The Boxer, a 2nd-century-BCE Greek bronze excavated on the Quirinale Hill in 1885, and the Dying Niobid, a 4th-century-BCE Greek marble statue. But it's the magnificent and vibrantly colored Villa Livia and Villa Farnesia frescoes on the 2nd floor that are the undisputed highlight.\nThe frescoes, which adorned the interior walls of the villas, provide a vivid picture of what a grand ancient Roman villa would have looked like. There are intimate cubicula (bedroom) frescoes focusing on nature, mythology, domestic and erotic life, and delicate landscape paintings from a dark-painted winter triclinium (living and dining area).\nParticularly breathtaking are the frescoes from Villa Livia (dating from 30 BCE to 20 BCE), one of the homes of Augustus' wife Livia Drusilla. These cover an entire room and depict a paradisiacal garden full of a wild tangle of roses, pomegranates, irises and camomile under a deep-blue sky. They once decorated a summer triclinium built half underground to provide protection from the heat.\n\n  \nThe ground and 1st floors are devoted to sculptures © Anna Pakutina / Shutterstock\n\nThe 2nd floor also features some exquisitely fine floor mosaics and rare inlay work. That these mosaics carpeted the floors of plush villas of aristocratic Romans in the 13th and 14th centuries is really quite extraordinary.\nOn the 1st floor, there's a fascinating display of bronze fittings from two ships recovered at the bottom of Lake Nemi in Lazio in the 1930s. These elaborate vessels had been built by order of Caligula and were used by the emperor as floating palaces.\nIn the basement, the unexciting-sounding coin collection is far more absorbing than you might expect, tracing the Roman Empire's propaganda offensive through its coins. There's also jewelry dating back several millennia, and the disturbing remains of a mummified eight-year-old girl, the only known example of mummification dating from the Roman Empire.\nTips and other practicalities\nThe museum is one of four that collectively make up the Museo Nazionale Romano. A combined ticket (€12/6), which is valid for three days, includes admission to the other three sites: the Terme di Diocleziano, Palazzo Altemps and the Crypta Balbi. An audio guide costs €5. A €100 million renovation project began in 2023 and the four museums may be temporarily closed over the course of the next four years.\n \n"

Much altered over the centuries, the basilica is an architectural hybrid with 14th-century Romanesque campanile, Renaissance coffered ceiling, 18th-century baroque facade, largely baroque interior and a series of glorious 5th-century mosaics.\nThe exterior fronting Piazza Santa Maria Maggiore is decorated with glimmering 13th-century mosaics that are screened by Ferdinand Fuga's baroque loggia (1741). Rising behind, the campanile – Rome's tallest – tops out at 75m (246ft).\n\n  \nTake time to admire the sumptuous interior of Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore © manjik / Shutterstock\n\nThe vast interior retains its original structure, despite the basilica's many overhauls. Particularly spectacular are the 5th-century mosaics in the triumphal arch and nave, depicting Old Testament scenes. The central image in the apse, signed by Jacopo Torriti, dates from the 13th century and represents the coronation of the Virgin Mary. Beneath your feet, the nave floor is a fine example of 12th-century Cosmati paving.\nThe 18th-century baldachin over the high altar is heavy with gilt cherubs; the altar itself is a porphyry sarcophagus, which is said to contain the relics of St Matthew and other martyrs. A plaque embedded in the floor to the right of the altar marks the spot where Gian Lorenzo Bernini and his father Pietro are buried. Steps lead down to the confessio (a crypt in which relics are placed), where a statue of Pope Pius IX kneels before a reliquary that is claimed to contain a fragment of Jesus' manger.\nThe sumptuously decorated Cappella Sistina, last on the right, was built by Domenico Fontana in the 16th century and contains the tombs of Popes Sixtus V and Pius V. Not as sumptuous but far more beautiful is the Cappella Sforza on the left, which was designed by Michelangelo.\nThrough the souvenir shop on the right-hand side of the church is the Museo del Tresoro (Treasury Museum) with a glittering collection of religious artifacts. Most interesting, however, is the Loggia delle Benedizioni (upper loggia), accessible only by 30-minute guided tours (in English; book at the basilica entrance). Here you can get a close look at the 13th-century mosaics on the facade, which were created by Filippo Rusuti.\nTips and other practicalities\nThe basilica is located about 500m (1640ft) from Termini station and can be easily reached on foot. It is open from 7am to 6:45pm and entry is free. Admission to the museum costs €3 and guided tours of the archaeological area underground are available for €5.\n"

    "detail_description": "Rome's most famous fountain, the iconic Fontana di Trevi, or Trevi Fountain, is a flamboyant baroque ensemble of mythical figures and wild horses taking up the entire side of the 17th-century Palazzo Poli. Thousands visit the fountain every day, keeping up with the tradition of tossing a coin into the water to ensure they will return to Rome. That, and it makes for a great photo opportunity. On average, about €3000 ($3250) is thrown in daily.\n\n  \nThere are some strict rules around the fountain, including no paddling and no bathing © TravnikovStudio / Shutterstock\n\nHistory\nThe fountain's design, the work of Nicola Salvi in 1732, depicts sea-god Oceanus in a shell-shaped chariot led by Tritons with seahorses – one wild, one docile – representing the moods of the sea. In the niche to the left of Neptune, a statue represents Abundance; to the right is Salubrity. The water comes from the Aqua Virgo, a 1st-century-BCE underground aqueduct, and the name Trevi refers to the \"tre vie\" (three roads) that converge at the fountain.\nThe famous tradition of tossing a coin into the fountain to ensure your trip to Rome comes from the 1954 film Three Coins in the Fountain. The money thrown into the Trevi is collected daily and goes to the Catholic charity Caritas, with its yield increasing significantly since the crackdown on people extracting the money for themselves.\nMost famously, Trevi Fountain is where movie star Anita Ekberg cavorted in a ballgown in director Federico Fellini's classic La Dolce Vita (1960); apparently she wore waders under her iconic black dress but still shivered during the winter shoot. In the summer of 2016, a British woman was fined €450 ($542) for dancing in the fountain in an evening dress and fur stole in blatant imitation of the iconic actress.\nIn 2016, fashion house Fendi staged a \"Legends and Fairytales\" fashion show at the fountain during which catwalk models walked on water – or rather strutted across a glass walkway constructed above the emerald water – as the sun set over this Roman icon. It was given permission to do so in acknowledgment of its €2.18 million ($2.62 million) sponsorship of the fountain's restoration.\n\n  \nIt can be crowded at the Trevi Fountain, so go in the evening for a more peaceful experience © muratart / Shutterstock\n\nTips and other practicalities\nThe Trevi Fountain is easily reached on foot from the Barberini metro station. Want to avoid the crowds? Visit later in the evening, when the fountain is beautifully lit, and you can appreciate its foaming majesty in a quieter environment.\nTrevi Fountain rules and etiquette\nPaddling or bathing in the fountain is strictly forbidden, as is eating and drinking on the steps leading down to the water. Both crimes risk an on-the-spot fine of up to €500 ($600).\nCoin-tossing etiquette includes throwing with your right hand over your left shoulder, with your back facing the fountain.\nNearby restaurants\nIndulge in a tasty Tuscan lunch before or afterwards at Il Chianti or head to Hostaria Romana, beloved by tourists and locals alike.\nBrasserie-style Baccano is a great all-rounder, perfect for a drink or snack whatever the time of day. San Crispino is the nearest recommended gelateria for a cool treat after admiring the fountain.\n"

    "detail_description": "For a thousand years this monumental cathedral was the most important church in Christendom. Commissioned by the emperor Constantine and consecrated in AD 324, it was the first Christian basilica built in Rome and, until the late 14th century, was the pope’s main place of worship. It's still Rome’s official cathedral and the pope’s seat as the bishop of Rome.\nHistory\nThe Basilica of San Giovanni in Laterano was built on the foundation of a previous religious structure, the church of San Salvatore, erected following an edict of Constantine, who had legalized freedom of worship and recognized Christianity as a legitimate religion that could be practiced in the empire.\nOver the centuries, the basilica was heavily damaged and reconstructed multiple times following conflicts and invasions. The current structure dates back to the 17th century, when Pope Alexander VII commissioned a new design from Francesco Borromini, one of Rome’s most revered architects at the time, for the 1650 Jubilee. Borromini managed to keep some of the elements of the earlier architecture that remain visible today, including the floor, the apse mosaic, and the ciborium. The facade would be added at a later stage – Alessandro Galilei completed it in 1732.\n\n  \nAdmire the mosaics that decorate the apse of the basilica © Stefano_Valeri / Shutterstock\n\nVisiting the basilica\nThis towering structure, surmounted by 157m-high (515ft) statues – Christ, St John the Baptist, John the Evangelist and the 12 Apostles – is an imposing example of late-baroque classicism. The central bronze doors in the porch were moved here from the Curia in the Roman Forum, while, on the far right, the Holy Door is only opened in Jubilee years.\nThe cavernous interior is a breathtaking sight with a golden gilt ceiling, a 15th-century mosaic floor, and a wide central nave lined with muscular 4.6m-high (15ft) sculptures of the apostles.\nAt the head of the nave, the Gothic baldachin over the papal altar is said to contain the relics of the heads of Saints Peter and Paul. In front, a double staircase leads down to the confessio where you'll see a wooden statue of St John the Baptist and the Renaissance tomb of Pope Martin V.\nBehind the altar, the massive apse is decorated with sparkling mosaics. Parts of these date from the 4th century, but most were added in the 1800s. To the right of the apse, through a small gift shop, the Museo del Tesoro contains a small collection of religious artifacts and vestments.\nAt the other end of the basilica, on the first pillar in the right-hand aisle, is an incomplete Giotto fresco. While admiring this, cock your ear towards the next column, where a monument to Pope Sylvester II (r 999–1003) is said to sweat and creak when the death of a pope is imminent.\nOutside the church, the beautiful 13th-century cloister, accessible to the left of the altar, is a lovely, peaceful place with graceful twisted columns set around a central garden.\nTips and other practicalities\nEntering the basilica is free. If time allows it’s worth visiting the museum of Palazzo Lateranens as well – the collection of liturgical furnishings, religious artworks and objects that belong to Popes of the past is an insightful journey into the history of the Catholic Church. Tickets for guided tours cost €17.50 and can be purchased via the official website of the museum.\n"

    "detail_description": "If you only have time for one art gallery in Rome, make it this one. Housing what's often referred to as the \"queen of all private art collections\", it boasts paintings by Caravaggio, Raphael and Titian, plus sensational sculptures by Bernini. Highlights abound, but look for Bernini's Ratto di Proserpina (Rape of Proserpina) and Canova's Venere vincitrice (Venus Victrix).\nHistory\nThe museum's collection was formed by Cardinal Scipione Borghese (1577–1633), the most knowledgeable and ruthless art collector of his day. It was originally housed in the cardinal's residence near St Peter's, but in the 1620s he had it transferred to his new villa just outside Porta Pinciana. And it's here, in the villa's central building, the Casino Borghese, that you'll see it today.\nOver the centuries, the villa has undergone several overhauls, most notably in the late 1700s when Prince Marcantonio Borghese added much of the lavish neoclassical decor.\nFind your way around\nThe museum is divided into two parts: the ground-floor gallery, with its superb sculptures, intricate Roman floor mosaics and over-the-top frescoes, and the upstairs picture gallery.\nStairs lead up to a portico flanking the grand entrance hall, decorated with 4th-century floor mosaics of fighting gladiators and a 2nd-century Satiro Combattente (Fighting Satyr). High on the wall is a gravity-defying bas-relief of a horse and rider falling into the void (Marco Curzio a Cavallo) by Pietro Bernini (Gian Lorenzo's father).\nThe statuesque scene-stealer of Sala I is Antonio Canova's daring depiction of Napoleon's sister, Paolina Bonaparte Borghese, reclining topless as Venere vincitrice (1805–08).\n\n  \nBernini's masterpiece Ratto di Proserpina is found in Sala IV © wjarek / Shutterstock\n\nFurther on, in Sala III, Gian Lorenzo Bernini's Apollo e Dafne (1622–25), one of a series depicting pagan myths, captures the exact moment Daphne's hands start morphing into leaves. Sala IV is home to Bernini's masterpiece Ratto di Proserpina (1621–22). This flamboyant sculpture brilliantly reveals the artist's virtuosity – just look at Pluto's hand pressing into the seemingly soft flesh of Persephone's thigh.\nCaravaggio dominates Sala VIII. There's a dissipated-looking self-portrait, Bacchino malato (Young Sick Bacchus; 1592–95), the strangely beautiful La Madonna dei Palafrenieri (Madonna with Serpent; 1605–06) and San Giovanni Battista (St John the Baptist; 1609–10), probably Caravaggio's last work. There's also the much-loved Ragazzo col Canestro di Frutta (Boy with a Basket of Fruit; 1593–95) and the dramatic Davide con la Testa di Golia (David with the Head of Goliath; 1609–10) – Goliath's severed head is also said to be a self-portrait.\nUpstairs, the pinacoteca offers a wonderful snapshot of Renaissance art. Don't miss Raphael's extraordinary La Deposizione di Cristo (The Deposition; 1507) in Sala IX, and his Dama con Liocorno (Lady with a Unicorn; 1506). In the same room is Fra Bartolomeo's superb Adorazione del Bambino (Adoration of the Christ Child; 1495) and Perugino's Madonna con Bambino (Madonna and Child; first quarter of the 16th century).\nOther highlights include Correggio's erotic Danaë (1530–31) in Sala X, Bernini's self-portraits in Sala XIV, and Titian's great masterpiece, Amor Sacro e Amor Profano (Sacred and Profane Love; 1514) in Sala XX.\nTips and other practicalities\nTo limit numbers, visitors are admitted at two-hourly intervals – you'll need to pre-book tickets well in advance and get an entry time. Adult tickets cost €13 (plus a €2 booking fee) and can be purchased online via the museum’s official website.\nAudio guides cost €5 and can be picked up in the basement ticket area, where there is also a coat check and a small cafe. The museum is closed on Mondays.\n"

Fill up with water at the nasone (\"big nose\") drinking fountain in the north of the piazza.\nAnother draw is the historic Christmas market staged in December, which traditionally runs until Jan. 6.\nHistory\nIts grand centerpiece is Bernini’s Fontana dei Quattro Fiumi, a flamboyant fountain featuring an Egyptian obelisk and muscular personifications of the rivers Nile, Ganges, Danube and Plate. According to legend, the Nile figure is shielding his eyes to avoid looking at the Chiesa di Sant’Agnese in Agone, designed by Bernini’s bitter rival Borromini. In truth, Bernini had completed his fountain two years before Borromini started work on the church's facade, and the gesture simply indicated that the source of the Nile was unknown at the time.\n\n  \nThe Four Rivers Fountain in Piazza Navona ©Belenos/Shutterstock\n\nOther fountains include the Fontana del Moro, at the southern end of the square, which was designed by Giacomo della Porta in 1576. Bernini added the Moor in the mid-17th century, but the surrounding Tritons are 19th-century copies. And at the northern end of the piazza, the 19th-century Fontana del Nettuno depicts Neptune fighting with a sea monster, surrounded by sea nymphs.\nIn addition to the fountains, top sights here include the Chiesa di Sant’Agnese in Agone. With its theatrical facade and rich, domed interior, it is typical of Francesco Borromini’s baroque style. The church, which regularly hosts classical music concerts, is said to stand on the spot where the martyr Agnes performed a miracle before being killed. Legend has it that after being stripped naked by her executioners, her hair miraculously grew to cover her body and preserve her modesty.\nAlso worth noting is the Palazzo Pamphilj which was commissioned by Giovanni Battista Pamphilj to celebrate his election as Pope Innocent X. This elegant baroque palazzo was built between 1644 and 1650 by Borromini and Girolamo Rainaldi. Inside, there are some impressive frescoes by Pietro da Cortona, but the building, which has been the Brazilian Embassy since 1920, can only be visited on a pre-booked guided tour.\nLike many of the city’s landmarks, the piazza sits atop an ancient monument, in this case the Stadio di Domiziano. This 30,000-seat stadium, whose subterranean remains can be accessed from Via di Tor Sanguigna, used to host athletic meets – hence the name Navona, a corruption of the Greek word \"agon,\" meaning public games. Inevitably, though, it fell into disrepair and it wasn’t until the 15th century that the crumbling arena was paved over and Rome’s central market was transferred here from the Campidoglio.\nNearby restaurants\nAround Piazza Navona, Campo de’ Fiori and the Pantheon you’ll find all manner of places to eat, including some of the capital’s best restaurants (both contemporary and old-school), several excellent gelaterie and a number of highly rated street-food joints. Needless to say, there are also hundreds of overpriced tourist traps. To the south, the atmospheric Ghetto is the place to head to for traditional Roman-Jewish cuisine.\nHoused in the ground floor of Palazzo Braschi at the southern end of the piazza, Vivi Bistrot is a charming spot for a lunchtime bite.\nAnother good option is Etablì, a cool bar-restaurant in the warren of streets west of the square.\n"

    "detail_description": "A striking 2000-year-old temple built to honor the seven planetary deities and later transformed into a church, the Pantheon is the best preserved of Rome’s ancient monuments and one of the most influential buildings in the Western world.\nEmperor Hadrian commissioned this feat of engineering to be erected on the site of Marcus Agrippa’s earlier 27 BCE temple and has stood in the heart of Rome since around 125 CE. And while its graying, pockmarked exterior might look its age, it's still a unique and exhilarating experience to pass through its vast bronze doors and gaze up at the sky through the 9m-wide (29.5ft) oculus (the circular opening at the dome’s apex) in the center of what was the world’s largest dome up to the 15th century.\nThe Pantheon is vast – you’ll feel very small as you look up at the record-breaking dome soaring above your head. Adding to the effect are the shafts of light that stream in through the central oculus, illuminating the royal tombs set into the marble-clad interior.\nWith its revolutionary design, this awe-inspiring temple has served as an architectural blueprint for millennia.\n\n  \nThe Pantheon has been an architectural blueprint for millennia © Resul Muslu / Shutterstock\n\nHistory\nFor centuries, the inscription under the pediment – “M:AGRIPPA.L.F.COS.TERTIUM.FECIT,” or “Marcus Agrippa, son of Lucius, in his third consulate built this” – led scholars to think that the current building was Agrippa's original temple. However, 19th-century excavations revealed traces of an earlier temple and historians realized that Hadrian had simply kept Agrippa's original inscription.\nHadrian's temple was dedicated to the classical gods – hence the name Pantheon, a derivation of the Greek words pan (all) and theos (god) – but in 609 CE, it was consecrated as a Christian church, and it's now officially known as the Basilica di Santa Maria ad Martyres. To avoid the massive dome – with over 43m (141ft) in diameter – from collapsing into itself, Roman architects used increasingly lighter materials to reach the “eye”, meant to be both a light source and a direct connection with the deities.\nThanks to this consecration, it was spared the worst of the medieval plundering that reduced many of Rome's ancient buildings to near dereliction. But it didn't escape entirely unscathed – in August 1625 Pope Urban VIII, a member of the Barberini family, decided to remove the Pantheon’s gilded-bronze roof tiles and bronze from the portico and have Gianlorenzo Bernini use it to build his baldachin at St Peter's Basilica. The “theft” gave rise to the saying “Quod non fecerunt barbari, fecerunt Barberini” (What the barbarians didn’t do, the Barberini did).\nThe Pantheon’s exterior is a massively imposing sight with 16 Corinthian columns, each 11.8m (39ft) high and each made from a single block of Egyptian granite, supporting a triangular pediment. Rivets and holes in the brickwork indicate where the original marble-veneer panels were removed.\nDuring the Renaissance, the building was much studied – Brunelleschi used it as inspiration for his cupola in Florence – and it became an important burial chamber. In the cavernous marble-clad interior you'll find the tomb of the artist Raphael, alongside those of kings Vittorio Emanuele II and Umberto I.\nTips and other practicalities\nThe Pantheon is open daily from 9am to 7pm. The entrance used to be free until recently – from July 1, 2023, a €5 ticket has been introduced. On holidays and weekends you are required to book your ticket or tour in advance via the Pantheon’s official website.\nEach Pentecost, tens of thousands of red petals are rained down on the Pantheon through the oculus. This centuries-old tradition represents the Holy Spirit descending to earth.\nTourist visits are not allowed during mass (from 5pm Saturday and from 10:30am Sunday). An audio guide costs €10 ($10.90) and guided tours start from €20. Closed on January 1 and December 25.\nRestaurants nearby\nThe streets around the Pantheon are thick with trattorias, cafes and bars. For an uplifting espresso, try the nearby La Casa del Caffè Tazza d’Oro, one of Rome's finest coffee houses. On a hot summer day, make sure to try its “granita al caffè” - a sweet, shaved ice coffee treat. Alternatively, Sant’Eustachio is an equally iconic espresso institution.\nOn the other side of the Pantheon, Ginger is a contemporary all-day dining spot, good for sandwiches, burgers and full-on restaurant meals.\n"

    "detail_description": "Even in a city of outstanding churches like Rome, St Peter’s is special. Everything about the Vatican’s showpiece basilica is astonishing, from the sweeping piazza that announces it to its grandiose facade and lavish interior.\nChief among its many treasures are two of Michelangelo’s most celebrated works: his Pietà sculpture and the basilica’s landmark dome, a soaring masterpiece of Renaissance architecture that towers over the Roman skyline.\nHistory of the Basilica\nThe original St Peter’s – beneath the current basilica – was commissioned by the Roman emperor Constantine and built around 349 CE on the site where St Peter was supposedly buried. But like many medieval churches, it eventually fell into disrepair and it wasn’t until the mid-15th century that efforts were made to restore it.\nConstruction began on the basilica in 1506. Progress was slow and when Bramante, the project’s chief architect, died in 1514 work ground to a halt. Little was achieved over the next few decades as architects, including Raphael and Antonio da Sangallo, sought to modify Bramante’s ambitious plans.\nThe breakthrough eventually came in 1547 when Michelangelo took charge. He simplified Bramante’s designs and drew up plans for what would become his crowning architectural achievement – the dome. He never lived to see it built though, and it was left to Giacomo della Porta and Domenico Fontana to finish it in 1590.\nWith the dome in place, Carlo Maderno inherited the project in 1603. He designed the monumental facade and lengthened the nave towards the piazza.\nThe basilica was finally consecrated in 1626.\nBefore you go inside\nCheck out Maderno’s epic facade. Built between 1608 and 1612, the colossal structure is 48m (157ft) high and 115m (377ft) wide. Eight massive columns support the upper attic on which 13 statues stand representing Christ the Redeemer, St John the Baptist and the 11 apostles.\nThe central balcony, known as the Loggia della Benedizione, is where the pope delivers his Urbi et Orbi blessing at Christmas and Easter.\nAbove the balcony, an inscription runs across the entablature: \"IN HONOREM PRINCIPIS APOST PAVLVS V BVRGHESIVS ROMANVS PONT MAX AN MDCXII PONT VII\". Translated from Latin, this reads: \"In honor of the Prince of Apostles, Paul V Borghese, Roman, Pontiff, in the year 1612, the seventh of his pontificate\".\n\n  \nOrnate golden interior of St. Peter's Basilica © Sun_Shine / Shutterstock\n\nInterior highlights\nThe cavernous 187m-long (614ft) interior covers more than 15,000 sq m (3.7 acres) and contains many artistic masterpieces. One of the most revered is Michelangelo's hauntingly beautiful Pietà at the head of the right nave. Sculpted when he was only 25, this is the only work the artist ever signed – his signature is etched into the sash across the Madonna's breast.\nNearby, a red floor disc marks the spot where Charlemagne and later Holy Roman Emperors were crowned by the pope.\nDominating the center of the basilica is Bernini's famous baldachin (canopy). Supported by four spiral columns and made with bronze taken from the Pantheon, this towers 29m (95ft) over the papal altar, itself situated over the site of St Peter’s tomb.\nLook up from here and you’ll see Michelangelo's dome rising to a height of 119m (390ft). The cupola, based on Brunelleschi’s dome in Florence, is supported by four stone piers named after the saints whose statues adorn their Bernini-designed niches – Longinus, Helena, Veronica and Andrew.\nAt the base of the Pier of St Longinus is Arnolfo di Cambio's much-loved 13th-century bronze statue of St Peter, its right foot worn down by centuries of caresses.\nAncient jewels and papal tombs\nFor a blast of papal glitter, the Museo del Tesoro (€5) – accessible from the left nave – showcases a rich collection of sacred relics. Standout pieces include a tabernacle by Donatello and the 6th-century Crux Vaticana, a jewel-studded cross that was a gift of the emperor Justinian II.\nLess showy are the Vatican Grottoes beneath the basilica. Free to enter, these contain the tombs of numerous popes, as well as several columns from the original 4th-century church.\nFurther underground is the necropolis where the tomb of St Peter is located. To visit this you’ll need to book a place on a guided tour run by the Ufficio Scavi (€13).\nClimb the dome\nSt Peter’s dome provides a stunning perch for views over Rome’s rooftops. To reach it, you can climb the whole way (551 steps) or take a lift halfway and walk the remaining 320 steps. Either way, it's a long, steep ascent, not recommended for anyone who suffers from claustrophobia or vertigo. Get tickets (€8/10 without/with lift) at the entrance on the right of the basilica's main portico.\n\n  \nAllow time to pass through security before you're able to access the basilica © Jupiterimages / Getty Images\n\nGo to mass with the pope\nTo attend a papal mass you’ll need to book free tickets through the Prefecture of the Papal Household. These run out quickly, so apply early, especially for Easter and Christmas services.\nTips and practicalities\nThe basilica is open daily from 7am to 6.30pm (7pm in summer). Entry is free but you’ll have to go through security checks on the piazza outside. The line for these can be long but it usually moves fairly quickly. To limit waiting time, come at lunchtime or in the late afternoon.\nWatch what you wear. Vigilant security guards enforce a strict dress code so if you want to get in, no micro shorts, miniskirts or bare shoulders.\nFor much of the year, seminarians from the Pontifical North American College lead free, two-hour basilica tours. These generally depart at 2.15pm Monday to Thursday from the south side of St Peter’s Square. No tickets are necessary but check the website for details.\nTo get to the basilica, take metro A to Ottaviano or bus 40 or 64 from Termini train station.\nPlaces to eat nearby\nAvoid the tourist traps around the basilica and head to the nearby neighborhood of Prati.\nFor a salad or tasty panino stop off at the hit organic takeaway Re-bìo, while for something more substantial, join the fashionable neighborhood diners at Il Sorpasso.\n"

    "detail_description": "Home to the Sistine Chapel and mile after mile of priceless masterpieces, the Vatican Museums (Musei Vaticani) are one of the world’s largest, busiest and most spectacular museum complexes.\nThe vast institution, made up of 26 museums and 7km (4.3 miles) of halls and galleries, houses the art and antiquities amassed by successive popes over the centuries. Highlights include a spectacular collection of classical statuary, a suite of rooms frescoed by Raphael, and the Michelangelo-painted Sistine Chapel.\nHousing the museums is the lavishly decorated Palazzo Apostolico. This immense 5.5-hectare (13.6 acres) superstructure consists of two palaces – the original Vatican palace (nearer to St Peter’s) and the 15th-century Palazzetto di Belvedere – joined by two long galleries.\nHistory of the Vatican Museums\nThe museums were originally founded in the 16th century by Pope Julius II to display the Vatican’s collection of classical sculptures. The first pieces were laid out in 1506 in the Cortile Ottagono (Octagonal Courtyard), where many remain to this day. Julius also commissioned two of the top artists of the age to work on the Vatican palace – Raphael to decorate his private apartments and Michelangelo to paint the Sistine Chapel.\nOver successive centuries, the popes continued to add to the collections and open new museums. Major developments included the establishment of the Museo Pio-Clementino in the late 18th century and the opening of the Etruscan and Egyptian museums by Pope Gregory XVI in the 1830s.\nMore recently, Pope John Paul II oversaw a lengthy restoration of the Sistine Chapel and a museum-wide spruce-up for the year 2000 Jubilee.\nThe greatest hits tour\nYou’ll need about three hours to cover the museums’ greatest hits on this whistle-stop tour.\nFrom the Cortile delle Corazze, head through the Cortile della Pigna to the Museo Chiaramonti. Don't stop here, but continue left, up the stairs, to the Museo Pio-Clementino where you’ll find the museums’ finest ancient sculpture. Chief among its many masterpieces are the Laocoön and Apollo Belvedere, both in the Cortile Ottagono (Octagonal Courtyard).\nFinished there, work your way through a series of rooms to the Sala Croce Greca (Greek Cross Room), from where the Simonetti staircase leads up to the Galleria dei Candelabri (Gallery of the Candelabra). Push on through this to the Galleria degli Arazzi (Tapestry Gallery) and Galleria delle Carte Geografiche (Map Gallery), a stunning 120m-long hall lined with remarkable 16th-century maps.\nAt the end of the gallery, the one-way system funnels you through the Sala Sobieski and on to the Stanze di Raffaello (Raphael Rooms), a series of four rooms frescoed by the Renaissance maestro. The star turn here is La Scuola di Atene (School of Athens; 1509–11) in the Stanza della Segnatura but you’ll also find extraordinary works in the Sala di Costantino, Stanza d'Eliodoro, and Stanza dell'Incendio di Borgo.\nAnywhere else these magnificent chambers would be the star attraction but here they’re the warm-up act for the grand finale – the Sistine Chapel.\n\n  \nCeiling of the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican Museum ©RPBaiao/Shutterstock\n\nSistine Chapel\nThe jewel in the Vatican crown, the Cappella Sistina houses two of the world’s most famous works of art – Michelangelo’s ceiling frescoes (1508–12) and his Giudizio Universale (Last Judgment; 1536–41).\nThe 800 sq-meter ceiling design – best viewed from the far east wall – centers on nine panels depicting stories from the Book of Genesis. The most famous image, the Creation of Adam, shows a bearded God reaching out to touch fingers with Adam and so bring him to life.\nOn the west wall, the mesmeric Giudizio Universale (Last Judgment) shows Christ passing sentence over the souls of the dead as they’re torn from their graves to face him. The saved get to stay up in heaven while the damned are sent down to face the demons in hell.\nBefore exiting the chapel, take time to check out the frescoes on the side walls. Painted by a crack team of Renaissance artists, these include Botticelli's Temptations of Christ and Perugino's great masterpiece, the Handing over of the Keys.\nWith more time\nYou could add several extra stops. Near the Cortile delle Corazze, the Pinacoteca boasts a formidable painting collection that includes Raphael’s last work, La Trasfigurazione (Transfiguration; 1516–20), and Leonardo da Vinci’s unfinished San Girolamo (St Jerome; c 1482).\nMoving on, the Braccio Nuovo (New Wing) of the Museo Chiaramonti features a celebrated statue depicting the river Nile as a reclining god covered by 16 babies.\nFor a change of period, the Museo Gregoriano Egizio (Egyptian Museum) displays finds from ancient Egypt and the Museo Gregoriano Etrusco (Etruscan Museum) showcases artifacts from the Etruscan tombs of northern Lazio.\n\n  \nThe sheer scale of the Vatican Museums can feel overwhelming for first-time visitors © Getty Images\n\nTickets, tours and practicalities\nYou’re not required to pre-purchase tickets but it’s worth it to avoid the notoriously long entry queues. Standard tickets, available directly at the museums’ entrance or online (plus €5 booking fee), cost €17. Demand is always high, so try to book as early as possible.\nOfficial tours can also be booked on the website. Packages include guided visits to the Vatican Gardens (well worth seeing) and an exclusive after-hours tour of the Sistine Chapel.\nThe museums are open 9am to 6pm Monday to Saturday, and to 2pm on the last Sunday of the month (when they are free but horrendously busy).\nNote that dress codes are enforced, so no uncovered shoulders, mini-skirts or short shorts.\nPhotography is permitted (without flashes or tripods) everywhere except the Sistine Chapel.\nThe best time to go\nRealistically, there’s no surefire way of avoiding the crowds. As a rough guide, Tuesdays and Thursdays are the quietest days of the week; Wednesday mornings can be good too as most people are at the pope’s weekly audience. Afternoons tend to be less crowded than mornings.\nPlaces to eat\nIn the museum, there’s a fine bistro in the Cortile della Pigna and several self-service cafeterias dotted around the complex.\nOutside, head to the nearby Bonci Pizzarium for a taste of heavenly pizza al taglio (sliced pizza).\n"
