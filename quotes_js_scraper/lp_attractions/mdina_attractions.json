    "detail_description": "The cathedral is said to be built on the site of the villa belonging to Publius, the Roman governor of Malta who welcomed St Paul in AD 60.The original Norman church was destroyed by an earthquake, and the restrained baroque edifice you see today was built between 1697 and 1702 by Lorenzo Gafa, who was influenced by the Italian master Borromini. Note the fire and serpent motifs atop the twin bell towers, symbolising the saint's first miracle in Malta.\nEchoing St John's Co-Cathedral in Valletta, the floor of St Paul's is covered with the polychrome marble tombstones of Maltese nobles and important clergymen, while the vault is painted with scenes from the life of St Paul. The altar painting The Conversion of St Paul by Mattia Preti survived the earthquake, so too did the beautifully carved oak doors to the sacristy on the north side, and the apse above the altar, featuring the fresco St Paul's Shipwreck."

The tooth belonging to the ancient shark Carcharodon megalodon is food for thought – measuring 18cm on the edge, it belonged to a 25m monster that prowled the Miocene seas 30 million years ago.\nThe skeletal anatomy room is also interesting, and includes the delicate filigree bones of a snake."

    "detail_description": "Mdina's ditch was an important element of its fortifications. It was first created in the 15th century, but was rebuilt by the Knights of St John's military architect Charles François de Mondion. More recently, the Mdina city walls had become overgrown with ivy and vegetation; the ditch was filled by 273 citrus and seven olive trees.\nIn a regeneration project completed in 2015, the trees were removed or moved, and the bastions restored. The citrus grove was replaced by a mix of lawn, stone paving, and saplings in pots. The landscaping has proved controversial, with an outcry over the removal of the mature citrus trees, the lack of shade, and the stark aesthetic. However, the restored bastions now gleam splendidly and are much more visible, and the gardens are far more accessible. The ditch now forms a space for festivals such as food fairs and concerts. Enquire at the tourist office about forthcoming events. The most common access is via stairs at the southwest corner of the walls near the San Pietro Bastion."
