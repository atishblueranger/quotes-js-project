Paths and trails lead you past the plant exhibits, an auditorium with preserved butterflies, and cages filled with squawking parrots.\nThe best way to get here is to take a taxi (one way around $15) and ask for Urbanización Orquídeas. Many taxi drivers don't know the place, so ask a few before committing."

Follow the winding path up the 444 steps to reach the hilltop Fortín del Cerro. Cannons, which were once used to protect Guayaquil from pirates, aim over the parapet toward the river and are still fired today during celebrations.\n You can climb the lighthouse for spectacular 360-degree views of the city and its rivers, and stop in a tiny chapel across from it."

    "detail_description": "This historic street, named after the well-known guayaquileño poet (1832–1907), begins at the northern end of the malecón, to the right of the stairs that head up the hill called Cerro Santa Ana. The narrow, winding street has several unobtrusive plaques set into the walls of some of its houses, indicating the simple residences of past presidents. The colonial wooden architecture has been allowed to age elegantly, albeit with a gloss of paint.\nSeveral artists live in the area, and there are art galleries and craft shops scattered along the lane.Keep going along the street and it eventually meets back up with the river, with a pleasant paved walkway skirting along its edge."

    "detail_description": "Colonial history meets the animal kingdom at this large site across the Puente Rafael Mendoza Aviles Bridge, east of Río Daule. The park is divided into three ‘zones’: the Endangered Wildlife Zone, which has 45 species of birds, animals and reptiles in a semi-natural habitat; the Urban Architecture Zone, which has a restaurant and showcases the development of early-20th-century architecture in Guayaquil; and the Traditions Zone, which focuses on local traditions, with an emphasis on rural customs, crafts and agriculture.\nA taxi from the city costs around $5 to $6, or you can take a Durán-bound bus from Terminal Río Daule. It’s easier to catch the bus back to the city from in front of the large mall on the main road, about a 200m walk from the park."

    "detail_description": "Like it's better known-brother Malecón 2000, Malecón El Salado is another attractive waterfront renewal project that's popular with residents. There are several eateries and cafes in a streamlined modern building along the estuary, plus a micro theater named Sala La Bota (tickets $5 to $25) with a funky adjacent coffee shop. Rowboats can also be rented (one to five people per boat).\nLocals with kids in tow head to Malecón El Salado on weekend nights to see the ‘dancing fountains’, a choreographed waterworks display at 7pm, 7:30pm and 8pm. The large square just south of the malecón, called the Plaza Rodolfo Baquerizo Moreno, is dominated by a large modernist structure. Expositions and events are held here periodically."

    "detail_description": "On the west side of Seminario Park is a cathedral originally built in 1547 as a wooden building – however, like much of Guayaquil, it was destroyed by fire. The present structure, completed in 1948 and renovated in 1978, is simple and modern, despite an extremely ornate front entrance. The surrounding park is also called Parque de Las Iguanas, due to its reptilian residents. Look closely and you can spot iguanas grazing on the rocks here.\nThe park also has an artificial lagoon with fish in it and a monument of Simón Bolívar (who fought for independence against Spain) mounted on a horse. Meanwhile, a sculpture of two fighting wild boars stands in the southeastern corner. Created by French sculptor Virgil Chaudejeaug, it represents fertility and virility and was given as a gift to the city by a Chinese colony that lived here in the late 19th century."

It’s a gated, policed public space with restaurants, a museum, a performance space, a movie theater and a shopping mall.\nAt the far northern end are good views of the colonial district of Las Peñas and Cerro Santa Ana and, in the distance, the Puente de la Unidad Nacional (National Union Bridge) soaring over the Río Daule. The Cinema Guayaquil has a dioramic, narrated historical overview of the city, in miniature, for those who don't have time to walk the entire place."

With its colonial-inspired architecture and tropical breezes, it feels a bit like Miami meets the Mediterranean.\nAround two dozen eating spots are clustered here, serving up everything from South American fusion to Spanish tapas. In addition to higher-end dining rooms, a handful of cafes serve up Italian, gourmet sandwiches, desserts and the like. It's a relaxing spot to dine al fresco, particularly on weekends, when some places host live music. Keep in mind that prices are higher here – but in general so is the quality.It's located across the Río Daule in the upscale district of Samborondón. From downtown Guayaquil, a taxi costs about $10."
