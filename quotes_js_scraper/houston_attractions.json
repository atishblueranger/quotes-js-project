Park highlights include the crowd-pleasing colony of 250,000 Mexican bats under the Waugh Dr Bridge; the Green Tree Nature Area, a verdant walking space nearby; and the Water Works, a former utility site (105 Sabine St) transformed to hold playgrounds, exhibits and information sources. There are some lovely trails along the river, although it's advisable to do them early in the day to avoid stifling temperatures.\nFood and drink\nA selection of food trucks are parked up at the Water Works on Sabine Street. There are also lots of scenic picnic spots if you fancy bringing your own lunch to the park. Glass containers and alcohol are prohibited.\n"

    "detail_description": "The Menil Collection is considered one of the most important privately assembled art collections of the twentieth century and is a Houston highlight.&nbsp;Housed in a modernist building designed by Renzo Piano, it only displays a careful selection of highlights at any one time. Representative pieces span the ages, from Ice Age carvings, via Cycladic figures from 2800 BCE and Benin bronzes, to more recent works by Pablo Picasso, Francis Bacon, Andy Warhol and Kara Walker.\nWho owns the Menil Collection?\nAs the name suggests, the Menil Collection is rooted in the extraordinary array of art and archaeological artifacts amassed by Houstonians John and Dominique de Menil. The gallery&nbsp;was opened to the public in 1987 but it doesn't house the entire collection. The collection consists of over 17,000 works of art and pieces are curated and rotated regularly. A non-profit charitable foundation has managed the collection since the death of Dominique de Menil in 1997.\nThe single gallery in the Menil Drawing Institute, alongside, hosts changing exhibitions devoted to big-name artists. Be sure you also visit the Cy Twombly Gallery and the serene and meditative Rothko Chapel, annexes of the collection.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe collection is free to all, you just need to book an appointment online for a scheduled visit. The Menil&nbsp;Foundation has stated that the collection will always remain free of charge to the public.\n"
