    "detail_description": "The Kostaki Mansion was constructed in 1917 for a Greek banker and briefly hosted Atatürk in 1924. The Ottoman Black Sea-style building, with its fine neo-rococo interiors, has been used as an archaeological museum for many years but at the time of research was closed for long term reconstruction, until at least 2023.\nWhen it reopens, the collection's main glory is a flattened bronze statue of Hermes unearthed at Tabakhane in 1997."

    "detail_description": "This professionally presented ethnographic museum tells the main points of the city's history three times over, once in film, once in artefacts and once interactively with English options. All else is in Turkish unless you get the audioguide, but the celebration of local crafts, from hazelnut production to pistol making, are fairly self-explanatory, as is the basement section on local food, music and dance.\nFor football fans, there's a separate Trabzonspor Football Club museum next door."

    "detail_description": "Recently restored with intricate ceiling paintings and back-lit panels in the spired minbar (pulpit), Çarşı Camii was till recently the largest mosque in central Trabzon, yet it's easily missed in the maze of market streets. The structure of variously coloured stone blocks was erected in 1839 but looks far older and its northeastern corner takes a fanciful leap over one of the market alleys.\nThe mosque has a second entrance in Muvakkithane Sokak."

Built for a wealthy Greek banking family in the Black Sea style popular in the Crimea, it was bequeathed to Atatürk in 1924, and it's believed he wrote part of his will here. Inside you can see photos and mementos of the great man, including a map of the WWI Dardanelles campaign scratched into the table in the study.\nIt is nestled in leafy Soǧuksu, 5km southwest of Atatürk Alanı. To get there take a Çamlik-bound dolmuş from a stand on Kahramanmaraş Caddesi (₺2.50)."

    "detail_description": "Standing in walled gardens amid symphonies of birdsong, 4km west of centre, is this fine 13th-century church-turned-mosque retaining some carved reliefs and colourful Christian-era murals. The bay views are lovely especially at sunset. In addition, there's a 1427 stand-alone bell tower and the remains of a 2nd-century Roman temple that was unearthed in 1997.\nThe centrepiece, originally called Hagia Sophia (Church of Divine Wisdom), was built between 1238 and 1263, and shows both Georgian and Seljuk design influences, though the wall paintings and mosaic floors follow the prevailing Constantinople style of the time. It was converted to a mosque after the Ottoman conquest in 1461, used as an ammunition-storage depot and hospital by the Russians after 1916, restored in the 1960s and partly reconverted to a mosque in 2013. At the time of research, the main interior was closed but the vaulted western narthex, with its extensively preserved frescoes of various biblical themes, remained accessible. A photo board outside shows you more from the interior.Set amid column remnants, Ottoman gravestones and an old-world corn-store barn, the site's basic garden cafe is a relaxing place for tea or inexpensive local snacks. Or walk out of the gardens' gate and descend the steps to find the much suaver Sofia Garden Cafe &amp; Brasserie.You can get pretty close to Aya Sofya using a Fatih dolmuş (₺2.50) starting from a stand one block west of Atatürk Alanı. The ensemble is visible from the north as you drive by on the D010 highway. Entrance to the garden is only possible from the south side."
