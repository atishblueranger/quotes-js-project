Visitors are expected to maintain silence, which enhances the serenity of the space. The samadhi (final resting place) of Sri Aurobindo and The Mother is surrounded by flowers and devotion. It's a place to pause, reflect, and experience inner stillness. Ideal for those seeking peace, simplicity, and a deeper connection to spiritual thought. Mobile phones need to be switched off inside the ashram to maintain the peaceful environment. There’s also a small bookshop where you can explore or purchase books by The Mother and Sri Aurobindo.",

We stayed there for 2 nights and 3 days. We tried snorkeling, diving, banana ride, and so much more. On our last day, once we were done with lunch and a little shopping, we even booked a yacht along with 3 other people, and this experience was much better than other boat trips in Goa. All in all, the whole trip was really good. We are back feeling refreshed, and ready to work harder for another trip! I would highly recommend Goa to everyone, but ensure visiting in winters.

A long road  which connects both the ends of the island. This road is a beautiful one with lots of century old trees on both sides. In my whole Andaman trip this place is very close to my heart.  A serene beach, beautiful place, not a crowded one with calm environment, loved ones near you, what to do you want more! Just pack your bags and go there with yout loved ones. Since there will be trouble getting phone signals there you will have much time to enjoy with your loved ones. Perfect place for honeymoon couples.  Still I couldn't forget the bluish green water, the white sand, centuries old trees standing tall, the sound of waves.....\nCouldn't explain more......  Each and every small things in this island is beautiful..\n\nLastly please dont miss the sunrise and sunset.. ❤❤❤❤",

This allows for safe and easy access to the bridge and the surrounding area.\nThe rocky terrain can be challenging, so wearing sturdy footwear is advisable.\n\nThe path to the bridge offers breathtaking views of the coastline, with the waves crashing against the rocks and the tranquil beauty of the ocean.\n\nThe Natural Bridge is a protected area, and visitors are encouraged to respect the environment.\nAvoid touching or disturbing the marine life, and refrain from leaving any litter behind.\n\nThank You😊",

Instructors and all diving crew will help you learn well, have fun and also share great recommendations for off-dive time in the city. Great diving facility with professional-grade and well-maintained gear. They've two pools for training different levels too. Great harbour location as well. They have two boats to venture out. The boat snacks packed by akka are sustainably packed in tiffin boxes and are just what you need after a tiring dive: tomato cucumber sandwiches, some dry cake, a tiny spicy biscuit and a juice can! You can have more if you're hungry (I know I was).\n\nTook my sister for her first discover dive with them and they did NOT disappoint. Went in June 2025. They include photos and videos from the dive as well, which was much appreciated!\n\nI did my rescue, deep and nitrox courses with them. The artificial reef in Pondy is refreshing to see. Hundreds of fish out there: bat fish, blue streak fusiliers, black triggerfish, barracudas(!) and 2 cobias we mistook for little sharks as well xD The ravines and net caves were also interesting dive sites to see. Lots of coral on that tabletop.\n\nAll in all, a great time diving with Chakra. Definitely recommend going with them.",

Our instructors Manisha and Siddharth were absolute stars – patient, clear in their instructions, and kept the mood light so we never felt nervous, even as first-timers.\n\nThey gave us proper pool training before heading out, teaching exactly how to handle the equipment and what to do if anything unusual happens underwater. All the gear was in great condition, and both of them made sure safety always came first.\n\nThe dive itself lasted about 35 minutes (9 meters deep!) and honestly, it felt like entering another world – colourful fish, calm waters, and that magical underwater silence.\n\nOh, and fun fact – neither me nor my friend can swim. Still, thanks to Manisha and Siddharth, we felt completely safe and confident the whole time.\n\nThey even served refreshments after the dive, which was the perfect ending to a day of feeling like underwater explorers. 🌊\n\nIf you’ve never tried scuba diving before, do it at least once in your life – and if you’re in Pondicherry, go with Chakra Divers. And if you’re lucky, you’ll get Manisha and Siddharth as your dive buddies – trust me, you’ll be in the best hands!",
