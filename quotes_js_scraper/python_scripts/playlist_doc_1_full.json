The staff seemed uninterested, and the overall ambience was dull and unimpressive\nThe worst part? After finishing our meal, there was no water available at the handwash station. How does a restaurant run out of water? That’s basic hygiene!\nAnd to top it all off, we ordered boneless butter chicken, but instead of actual boneless pieces, they just removed the bones from regular chicken and served it. That’s not what we paid for!\nAbsolutely disappointed and won’t be visiting again. Wouldn’t recommend this place to anyone.",

Tucked away in a peaceful corner of Dal Lake banks, it offers not just great food, but a full experience, one that blends flavour, ambiance, and a touch of cultural memory. The name Lhasa itself evokes the spirit of resistance and identity, and it’s fitting that the restaurant carries forward that legacy through authentic, soulful cuisine rooted in Tibetan traditions.\n\nThe outdoor garden seating is a real charm, especially in the evenings. It’s spacious, green, and calm, making it perfect for long conversations over hot bowls of soup or a plate of well-cooked Fried Rice. The interiors are warm and inviting, with thoughtful design elements that reflect Himalayan culture without going over the top. Staff are highly professional, attentive, and respectful, ensuring you’re well taken care of without being intrusive.\n\nAs for the food, the quality is consistently impressive. The fried rice here, in particular, is unmatched. No other place in Srinagar even comes close to the balance of flavour and texture they’ve perfected in that one dish. Whether you’re in the mood for something light or a full Tibetan meal, Lhasa delivers on both taste and authenticity.\n\nHighly recommended for anyone looking to explore beyond the usual Mughlai and Wazwan circuit. It’s not just a restaurant, it’s a quiet nod to a culture that continues to thrive through its food",

We had to try the famous Kashmiri Wazwan and we got it here. It was mouth watering. Steam rice with 5 types of mutton. The place was crowded as it was peak lunch time, but they have multiple floors, so we got place to sit quickly. We also tried tandoori chicken which was amazing.\nDo try below items if you visit :\nKashmiri Wazwan Thali (contains 5 types of mutton)\nTandoori chicken\nAlso the place is located in market area so visit when you are going to Lal chowk for shopping.",

However, that’s where the good things ended.\n\nThe service was very poor. When we arrived, no one paid attention to us for a long time. It took over 20 minutes before someone even came to take our order, which was quite frustrating.\n\nAs for the food, I ordered the biryani, which was priced at ₹160 per plate, but it was nowhere close to what a biryani should be. It came with just one small piece of chicken, an oily pile of rice that looked more like a fried pulao than biryani, and a tiny serving of what they called raita, which didn’t taste like raita at all. There was no onion salad, which is usually a basic complementary item with biryani. The food was extremely oily and unhealthy, and given the taste and quality, it certainly wasn’t worth the high price.\n\nI didn’t try the other food items because, as they say, first impression is the last impression. It wouldn’t be fair of me to say all their dishes are bad based only on this one experience, so this review is specifically about the biryani, which I hope helps others make an informed choice.\n\nOverall, despite the good ambience, the poor service, overpriced menu, and substandard biryani make it hard for me to recommend this place, at least for biryani lovers. I hope they improve their food quality and service in the future.",

The location is also a huge plus, easily accessible and surrounded by a great view.\n\nThe veg food options were incredibly diverse and delicious. Each dish was thoughtfully prepared, showcasing the chef's skill and creativity. The service was top-notch, with friendly and attentive smiling staff who made sure our needs were met throughout the meal.\n\nHowever, I did encounter a minor issue with one piece of meat in my dish, which wasn't up to the mark. But what truly impressed me was the manager's response - he apologized and mentioned that if he had known, he would have offered to change the dish. This level of accountability and customer care speaks volumes about the restaurant's commitment to quality and customer satisfaction.\n\nOverall, I'd highly recommend Steam Restaurant for its ambiance, veg food, and service. With a bit of quality control tweaking, they'll be unstoppable! 👍",

            "text": "I have been to this place a long time ago. Back then, they were located just outside of GMC Srinagar. Their food at that time was average. Nothing great. Not bad either.\n\nBut when I went to their new restaurant recently, I was amazed by the changes. In the new restaurant as well as in the food.\n\nTheir food quality and taste has improved so much. It went from 4/10 to a 7/10 or even 8/10 ( for me though)\n\nI had chicken momos, a pizza and a burger. The burger was just amazing. The bun was fresh. And soft. Not those regular tasteless buns that you see everywhere. The patty too was full of taste and juicy. The burger was a surprise for me. You don't find this kind of burger in Kashmir. At least I haven't till now.\n\nDidn't like the mint chutney though. They can do with some more chutneys.\n\nThe pizza was better than what they used to make in the past. It was crisp and cheesy.\n\nThat burger will surely make me go back there.",

Visited this place on my first day in Srinagar and now on the last day as well. They make absolutely great pizzas, breads and momo (with their own twist with their inhouse yummy sau e). I am sure they are equally good in other dishes but I didn't get to taste them. They serve good shakes and mojitos as well. It may seem like a simple order, but you need to taste all this, to experience the fine balance and the crispness, not to forget the great love with which they serve food.\n\nThe man in charge / owner Shaukat (known as Shauki) is an amazing human being, courteous, polite and serves with a big smile on his face. Ambience is modern and slick. Check out the pics.\n\nDo visit this place next time you are in Srinagar.\n\nPros - Good food, ample parking, reasonable cost, clean washroom, hygenic, free smiles, stairs with side rails.\n\nCon - This is on 1st floor. Not complaining but just for your information, just in case you have an elderly or a sprained ankle.",

The service and food quality used to be great, but over the past couple of months, both have drastically declined. The service was abysmal, with no waiters in sight, and the food was far from its previous standard. To top it off, the price hike was not at all justified. It’s sad to see a place that once had great potential fall short in so many areas. I’m not sure I’ll be returning anytime soon.Hope you will resolve this issue ...",
