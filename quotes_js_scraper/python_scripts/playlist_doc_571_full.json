The Sheesh Mahal is simply magical........the tiny mirrors sparkle beautifully, even in the faintest light.\nI’d highly recommend taking a local guide........they share fascinating stories, little-known facts, and bring the fort’s past to life in a way that signboards never can. The architecture is stunning........with a perfect blend of Rajput charm and Mughal elegance, and the views of Maota Lake from the top are picture-perfect.\nIf you can........arrive early to enjoy the elephant ride up to the fort........it’s a unique, royal touch to the experience. For a different vibe........there’s also a light and sound show in the evening that tells the fort’s history beautifully.\nAmber Fort isn’t just a sightseeing spot........it’s a walk through Rajasthan’s glorious past........and honestly........it’s one of Jaipur’s must-visits.",

If you’re in a cab with a guide, they’ll usually take you through the village shortcut and park at the top, saving you a lot of time.

I highly recommend going early in the morning – the temperature is pleasant, and the crowd is minimal, making it perfect to explore the fort peacefully and click great photos without much disturbance.\n\nA small tip: do not book a jeep to reach the fort entrance. It’s completely unnecessary. The walk uphill is hardly 200-300 meters and very manageable, even in casual footwear.\n\nHiring a guide is a must if you want to understand the rich history and architectural details of the fort. The official guide charges are ₹400 for a group of 1-4 people and ₹600 for a group of 6-14. It’s definitely worth it for the added insight.\n\nOne important caution: avoid buying souvenirs from the shops inside the fort. They are extremely overpriced – you can find the same items outside the fort or in the local markets for 4-5 times cheaper.\n\nOverall, Amber Fort is stunning and offers a great start to your Jaipur trip if you plan wisely!",

The day view is breathtaking, but the night view with sparkling city lights is simply unforgettable.\nThe place does get hot during the day, so the best time to visit is from mid-August to February.\n\nA small tip: you’ll find monkeys around in the evening. Avoid carrying water bottles in your hand or teasing them – I had one snatch mine! Bring some extra water for them instead.\n\nOverall, an amazing spot for photography and one of the best city views I’ve ever seen. Highly recommend!",

I know it's heritage hotel but there furniture is outdated it's not antique at all atleast in our apartment we stayed.\nWe were told it has kitchen but it wasn't there not even fridge it was provided after we made them aware of issue.\nWashrooms were not clean specifically taps and shower heads some taps were not working. One washroom had no door lock to lock while someone is using it.\nCarpet was filthy and very dirty TV was from 1990s.\nThey need to do lot of work in that accommodation compare how much they are charging for it.\nOverall it wasn't a great experience most of the staff was helpful and did best to their abilities.

The palace itself gives proper mahal wali vibe — perfect for a peaceful date, a shoot, or just to soak in the grandeur.\n\nEvery corner is photogenic — literally Instagram heaven. I couldn’t get enough of it. The café and restaurant inside are also top-notch — both in service and taste.\n\nI didn’t stay this time, but next time I’m definitely booking a stay here to experience the royal hospitality to the fullest.\nHighly recommend this gem in Jaipur!",

The room's fan was bent, and as debris fell, my wife was injured with some scratches and a small injury to her head. Thankfully, we weren’t more seriously hurt, but this incident left us shaken and traumatized. The hotel did offer us a refund and free meals, but after such a terrifying experience, we couldn’t trust the safety of the place anymore.\n\nWe chose this hotel based on its appearance and amenities, but after the ceiling collapse, it was clear that the building was poorly maintained. It didn’t seem safe, and the lack of guests staying there only added to our concerns. We immediately cut our trip short after the incident and decided to stay at another hotel.\n\nI would strongly advise anyone considering this hotel to look elsewhere. It was a terrifying experience that left us with lasting trauma, and it’s not worth the risk to your safety.",

The property is full of charm—vintage furniture, colorful Rajasthani frescoes, and sprawling gardens that give it a peaceful, regal vibe. It doesn’t feel like a typical hotel, but more like a heritage home with a lot of character.\n\nThe rooms are spacious and thoughtfully done, maintaining the old-world charm while still being comfortable. The staff was courteous and made sure we had a pleasant stay. The location is great too—centrally placed but tucked away from the city noise.\n\nI also visited  the Shikarbagh restaurant on-site—perfect for a relaxed evening. Overall, it was a memorable and unique experience, especially if you enjoy heritage properties and a slower, more elegant pace of travel.",

Service is terrible, every time I was there to ask anything they let me wait an because, despite the fact there were 3 people in the desk, everything pass through a single person. Don’t really know what others employee were doing. From a four star hotel in India, I did expect a money exchange services or at least an ATM on the premises and it doesn’t. The breakfast is ok but could be much better, look like everyone is cooked while in advance. The pool is really nice but I thing the sun lounger need to be moved on the other side where the grass is much more and the ground is flat. When you get out from the pool there is a part with no grass and your feet get dirty easily. In addition the ground is not leveled and really uncomfortable. The service at the swimming pool need to be improved. One single person for towels and drinks is not enough.\nThe rooms and bathroom were pretty big and had all the confort, not gonna lie. This hotel, with a decent management could be a really nice pearls since the calm and green who surrendered this place. Had an amazing massage a the spa, the guy is really good at.",

Built in 1799, this beautiful five-story palace made of red and pink sandstone is known for its 953 small windows, called jharokhas, designed to let cool air flow through the building.\n\nThe front of Hawa Mahal looks like a honeycomb or crown and is especially beautiful in the early morning light. Many people love taking photos from across the street, where several rooftop cafés offer the best views. From there, you can capture the full front of the palace—but please note, most cafés only allow photography if you buy something, like a cup of coffee or a snack. It’s a small price for a great experience and view.\n\nHawa Mahal was originally built so royal women could watch street life and festivals without being seen. Today, you can go inside and walk up the narrow ramps to enjoy beautiful views of the old city and nearby landmarks like Jantar Mantar.\n\nInside the palace, there are breezy passages, quiet courtyards, and a small museum. It doesn’t take much time to visit, but it’s full of charm and history.\n\nPlease also remember not to write or scratch on the walls. It’s a historic site, and we should help protect its beauty.\n\nHawa Mahal is a must-see in Jaipur—perfect for photography, culture, and a quick coffee with a royal view.",

Their efforts made the entire process seamless and stress-free.\n\nTo make our celebration even more special, the team arranged a beautiful candlelight dinner, which added a magical touch to the evening. The culinary experience was outstanding — the food prepared by Chef Abdul and team was full of flavor and authenticity, warmly served by Hamendra with utmost care. A big appreciation also goes to Rahul, who diligently assisted with food service and ensured that everything was perfect throughout.\n\nAdding to this already memorable experience, Satveer and his team also arranged a farm visit near the haveli, where we had a wonderful time enjoying horse riding, feeding them, and connecting with the serene countryside vibes. It was an absolute delight and made our stay even more unique.\n\nOverall, Shahpura Haveli gave us not just a celebration but a collection of unforgettable memories — from heritage charm to thoughtful arrangements and heartfelt hospitality. We highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a truly remarkable experience.",

The only breakfast options offered were poha and puri bhaji, but since puri bhaji would take time to prepare, poha was recommended.\nThis unexpected situation led to frustration within my family, who began blaming me for poor planning and not choosing a more reputable option like Hyatt or ITC instead of Shahpura Haveli.

What was especially disheartening was witnessing a stark difference in how guests were treated—while we received no greeting, a group of foreign tourists who arrived the next day were given a grand, royal welcome.\nIt was incredibly disappointing to feel overlooked and discriminated against in our own country.
