We took some great walks in the area during our three day stay...\n\nThis was my first visit to Puducherry and Simon, our host helped us plan our itinerary. He gave great suggestions on must-visit places and eateries. Though the suggestions were all awesome, we skipped on half the places because the kids never wanted to step out as they loved Simon's house so much.\n\nWe got the first floor cottage with sit-out area. The room, the decor, the plants, the mellow music, the chirping sound of birds...it was all amazingly relaxing and in perfect sync with our expectations from a vacation.\n\nKids were grumpy and sad while leaving the place. They wanted to stay with their Simon uncle forever and ever. We left the place with a heavy heart and a new friend added to our list. Thank you Simon for sharing your house with us....Goodbye...until we meet again!!",

The view from the restaurant overlooking the beach is just amazing. A perfect spot to relax.\n\nThe location is excellent, with lots of restaurants and pubs nearby. Definitely a good place to stay if you want to be in the middle of everything. My wife loved the big room and the whole French heritage vibe of the building. Honestly didn’t expect such a spacious room in the busy White Town area. It was a nice surprise. The corridor is a bit narrow, but the size of the room makes up for it.\n\nService was really good too. The staff were polite and helpful. Shoutout to Chef Arun. He asked us how we wanted our food and customized the Dragon Chicken for us. It turned out super tasty!\n\nOverall, a great place to stay. Would definitely recommend it. Totally worth the money.",

The cleanliness was far below acceptable standards; the room had a musty smell and visible dirt in several areas. To make matters worse, basic toiletries like dental kit were not provided, which is a basic expectation for any hotel. For the price it's too high they are looting us in the name of heritage properties. I cannot recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a decent stay. Save your money and look elsewhere will get better option in half the price.",

Swimming Pool: Although I don’t swim, I did notice that the pool didn’t appear very clean, which didn’t align with the otherwise good standards maintained across the property.\n\n2. Room Key Issues: We faced issues with the room key automatically deactivating, requiring us to return to the reception to reactivate it. This was quite inconvenient.\n\n3. Dining Area: While the food was excellent, the table setup in the dining area could use more attention. On multiple occasions, tables were allotted without napkins or tissue paper. We experienced this ourselves and also heard similar feedback from another family. It’s a small detail, but improving it would make the dining experience even better.",

The staff are very attentive to your needs and work really hard to ensure you have a relaxing dining experience. The only downside is you will in take in more calories than your daily needs - I suppose one should know that before stepping up to any sumptuous buffet.

Highly recommend this place especially for a large family gathering or office retreat but also ideal for solo travellers or couples since the rooms are thoughtfully designed. Thank you to all the staff at Kadal -le Marc and team!!",

This is located pretty close to the Serenity beach and has easy access from the main road. The property is very nicely made, with careful selection of furniture and decor. It has a nice swimming pool to relax. The kids had a great time in the pool and was definitely the saving grace, given the weather in Pondicherry now. The rooms are very well appointed with large spaces and beds good enough to accommodate 3 adults. Couple of rooms had an open bathroom, which gave a real feeling of being at a villa in Bali. The caretaker Krishna was always available and ensured our stay was peaceful. The villa has large sit out spaces tastefully furnished with beautiful furniture and decor. We had a great stay. Breakfast served was nice with good options, but would have preferred hot and freshly made at the villa. Overall an A+ villa that becomes A++ if you book the entire space.",

Tucked away in the charming lanes of White Town, this stunning property radiates aesthetic elegance. From the beautifully designed rooms to the calming ambience that instantly makes you feel at home.\n\nBut what truly sets this place apart is the incredible warmth of the staff. A special shoutout to Jemima, who was an angel! Not only did she ensure my early check-in went smoothly, but she also checked in on me multiple times during my stay with such genuine warmth.\n\nThe lovely Padmini from housekeeping was sweeter than honey. Courteous, thoughtful, and always smiling. And I can’t forget Suneel and Saravanan, who not only kept my room spotless but even left behind the cutest handwritten note, thanking me for choosing Le Dupleix. I mean, who does that?\n\nIf you’re heading to Pondy and want an experience that’s more than just a stay, something that truly touches your heart, Le Dupleix is the place to be. Can’t recommend it enough.",

Powerful warm shower and efficient ac and fans. Breakfast was very fresh each day and consisted of croissants, du pain and eggs.\nVery nice to chat to the friendly owners who were full of advice about the area. They also did our small bag of laundry free of charge which I thought was very generous. Highly recommend a stay here.",

For anyone who loves desserts, the macaronis are to die for. The spaghetti with meatballs and the rice with steamed egg curry are some of our other favorites. The food is very well-made, and well-served. Additionally, there are multiple other experiences within the hotel itself like Ladies Night, the Rooftop Cafe and so on all of which were incredibly fun experiences. Finally, the staff on duty were nice, kind and very friendly. I would highly recommend speaking to Humaira, if you are staying in The Promenade Hotel. She was accommodating and compromising, like helping freeze some of our food or even getting certain dishes ready even after the restaurant closed. She is also incredibly friendly, and we had a great time conversing with her. Alongside her, the rest of the staff were also very sweet and made the experience that much more special.",

They had provided soaps, towels shampoos.. it was completely a pleasant stay for us.  We checked out the next day morning.  Owners are very nice people.\n\nOnly one issue I faced.  There is a servant maid in the next block, who I think should be doing the cleaning work in this home stay.  She said that we had to pay Rs.300 as cleaning charges and it was House and Owner's rules.  Beware of this lady! She actually lied to us.  We paid the 300 to her.  Without consulting the owner  please do not pay anything to this lady under the pretext of Cleaning Charges.\n\nShe did not do any cleaning when we were there,   for the cleaning she intended to do after we leave, she has taken this money that too after lying to us that it is the House Owner's rule.  Please be careful.   If you intend to donate as tips, then it's a different story but demanding as cleaning charges is not good.\n\nOtherwise, it was a pleasant stay..  we recommend staying here.",

The owner was also very helpful in smallest of instances and I feel that really should be admired. The villa has a family-house like ambience (you'll find all the things required to stay peacefully as if you're in your own vacation home.), which was something evryone was looking for. Will definitely recommend other to try it out. However the place is at an average distance of 5-15km from most of the tourist places, but considering the geography of Pondicherry of a small scale, it didn't really matter to us since we had our own vehicle.",

Even after repeated requests, we were not provided cold water, which felt like basic hospitality missing.\n\nThe food did not redeem the situation. The chicken was undercooked, making it extremely chewy and unpleasant to eat. The Tagliatelle was also undercooked and lacked proper seasoning or texture. On top of that, the dishes were quite expensive, which only added to the disappointment considering the poor quality.\n\nService was frustratingly slow. When we requested to cancel some additional dishes just two minutes after ordering — due to the situation — the staff told us they had already begun preparation and could not cancel. Ironically, those dishes still took ages to arrive and had to be packed as we were no longer in the mood to sit and eat.\n\nAll in all, this place was a letdown on every front — food, service, comfort, and value for money. Definitely not worth the hype or the price. Would not recommend.",

Every dish we tried exceeded our expectations.\n\nThe service was equally impressive. Special thanks to Dharni Dharan for his outstanding hospitality and attention to detail. Rana was kind enough to capture a lovely photo of our group, making the moment even more memorable. Fouziya and Prabhas were also extremely warm and helpful, adding to the overall pleasant experience.\n\nVilla Shanti truly offers a perfect blend of amazing food and heartfelt service. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Pondicherry!",

It was such an inviting environment and the pool was so refreshing that we had to push ourselves to leave the hotel to sightsee! The location is minutes away from the promenade overlooking the beach, with easy access to dining and shops that line the stretch.\n\nThe hotel restaurant Les Alizes is truly remarkable - incredibly tasty dishes plated artistically and served with a smile by the able restaurant staff. Nithya, Johnson, Joseph and Mukundan took such good care of our 8 person group, elevating our dining experience with their warmth and prompt service. In addition to the excellent lunch and dinner, the breakfast offering is outstanding, offering a diverse selection that made our group, ranging from 79 years to 15 years super happy every morning!\n\nVery impressed with Palais de Mahe, Les Alizes and the CGH Earth experience. Highly recommend them to anyone looking for a place to stay when visiting Puducherry.",

A delicious mix of French, North Indian, South Indian, and other cuisines with a constantly revolving menu each day.

Place was neatly maintained with a charming ambience. Staff were very friendly but we had a not so great experience with one not well trained staff. Especially all the Staff at Front desk were extremely helpful, the Staff mam in reception was sweet enough to put Mehandi for my kid and also staff women at cafe at 2nd floor was greatly helpful, Abhijit was great. John at cafe was superbly friendly and helpful.\n\nBut sadly we felt one Staff member tall and with specs, serving food at 2nd floor Palais De Mahe cafeteria was bit rude. We had asked for one breakfast item if it could be packed for the kid and all we could here was a rude no, and a detailed explanation about what their Hotel is all about. We also felt he was particularly rude.\n\nSomeone need to train this Staff how to treat customers how to smile, how to say a polite no. These are basic hospitality etiquette.  We felt rather disappointed with your set menu, because today (Apr 28) we ordered 3 juice but the serving people never delivered it and forgot about it totally. So your set menu served with improperly trained Staff is a big let down for us as we did not stay at your hotel for free but paid for your services.",

But the highlight was definitely the La Villa special dessert — it was too good, with so many textures and layers of flavour that we absolutely loved.

Each dish was a masterpiece, beautifully presented and bursting with flavour. The creativity and craftsmanship of the chefs were evident in every bite, making it an unforgettable dining experience.\n\nThere are too many names to mention who made this stay exceptional, because everyone who was on duty during our stay offered service above and beyond, from the reception staff, the staff who oversaw the restaurant to the kitchen and housekeeping staff however, a big shout out  to Anil, Masee Lupin and Daia They all really know how to make a stay really special.\n\nTo make our stay even more special, the team went above and beyond by decorating our room for my partner’s birthday celebration. The effort and thoughtfulness that went into the setup made the occasion even more magical, and we couldn’t have asked for a better way to celebrate.\n\nThe theme continued the next morning with breakfast, we once again sat outside for a great breakfast, juice, great coffee, an assortment of fresh fruit with yogurt. Bread, croissants and pastries together with a hot option. What more could we need ! We loved it and to add to this, the service was excellent.\n\nA huge thank you to everyone at La Villa for making our stay so memorable. A big shout out to Anil, Masee; Lupin and Daia.

With no details ever overlooked.\n\nAnd, it doesn't end there...the food is absolutely outstanding and the breakast is literally a work of culinary art.\n\nThe a la carte meals are superb both in presentation and taste.

However, the dining experience was significantly let down by the poor service. The staff seemed inattentive and unresponsive while taking orders, and basic requests were either ignored or met with resistance. Moreover, there was a noticeable lack of warmth or courtesy — no smiles, and at times, even arguments with customers.\n\nGreat food can only go so far without good hospitality. I hope the management takes steps to improve the service, as it currently overshadows the quality of the food. This is not the first time to me here , which repeats so here i am with this review.",
