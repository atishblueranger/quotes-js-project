The synagogue features an interesting interior dome roof that was unique for its time. Women are allowed to sit in the balcony during services, which makes it a very welcoming place for visitors. The history of the Papal Jews and the synagogue itself is fascinating, and well worth a visit for anyone interested in Jewish culture.",
