It is highly recommended for visitors to see this place as it offers guided tours in both Italian and English language at affordable prices. Despite the minor issue of some rude Italians talking over the guide's English explanation, the guide was able to handle them and provide valuable insights into the fascinating history of the catacombs.",

If open, it is definitely worth a visit to appreciate its three-naved architecture and wooden vault. The apsidal paintings are also noteworthy. This magnificent early Gothic church holds significant historical value and serves as a great place of worship for Catholics.",
