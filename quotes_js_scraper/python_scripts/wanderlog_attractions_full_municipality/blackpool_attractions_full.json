At night, the neon lights illuminate the wheel in all its glory, creating a mesmerizing sight from the beach. Visitors can purchase tickets on Central Pier and enjoy a ride on this dynamic and reasonably priced attraction. Despite occasional long queues, the experience of seeing the town lights and Tower from above makes it well worth the wait.",
