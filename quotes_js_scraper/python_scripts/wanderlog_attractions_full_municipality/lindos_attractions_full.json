        "detail_description": "A friend in Rhodes organized a boat excursion with Lazy Day Lindos Rhodes, which turned out to be an amazing journey. The boat trip lasted most of the day and left us impressed. The captain, Dimitrios, was very friendly and accommodating. We made a few stops along the way to pick up passengers, but the main highlight was cruising along the coast near Lindos, offering breathtaking views of the acropolis.",
