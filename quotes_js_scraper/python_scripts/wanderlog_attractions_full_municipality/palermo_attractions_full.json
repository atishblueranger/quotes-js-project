The church is built into a cave where the relics of Saint Rosalia were discovered in 1624, leading to her adoption as the fourth female patron saint of Palermo. The facade dates back to 1600 and leads to an open dome that introduces visitors to the cave. It's a unique Catholic church with stunning views over the city.",
