It boasts a double facade and two towers, offering evidence of ancient Rome's influence on the city. The gate was initially known as Porta San Fermo during the Middle Ages due to its proximity to a church of the same name. Later, it earned its current name from a nearby Roman sarcophagus featuring two lions.",
