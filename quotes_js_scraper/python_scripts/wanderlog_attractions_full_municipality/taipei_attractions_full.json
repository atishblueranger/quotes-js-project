Established by soldiers fleeing to Taiwan in the late 1940s, it was known for its off-the-grid lifestyle and organic farms. However, after a transformation in 2010, it has become predominantly an artist village. Visitors can explore open artists' studios and public artworks while wandering through the narrow lanes and staircases of this living village.",
