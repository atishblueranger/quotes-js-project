Unlike other beaches in the area, it prohibits water sports, making it an ideal spot for peaceful swimming and relaxation. The fine grey-brownish sand invites sunbathers while shallow waters are safe for children to splash around. Lined with eateries and featuring a delightful boardwalk, this beachfront offers chair rentals and a tranquil ambiance.",

The sculpture depicts a fisherwoman carrying fish in a basket and a bucket, symbolizing the importance of fishing in this area. It is well-maintained with water fountains around it, but traffic around the roundabout can be challenging. This monument holds historical significance for the community as it represents their heritage as a former fishing village.",
