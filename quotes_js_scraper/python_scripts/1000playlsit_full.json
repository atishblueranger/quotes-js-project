I did not realize that ONLY the saunas and clothing pool were included in the 18.50€. If you went into the salt aquarium pool (which was my favorite) or the upstairs pool & saunas, you were charged an additional fee. So I thought it was all included.\n\nOverall, I had a nice time but was just surprised by the cost.  I'm assuming that's what the German signs were saying when I tapped my wrist band.\n\nI had a cappuccino which was 3.50€\n\nThe massage was separate, but the cost of spas turned out to be 44.30€",

Definitely skip the fish soup which was very disappointing. We also didn't like the dessert. The truffle was good, but we personally couldn't really taste it in the way that it would make it worth the price. So overall, if we would've paid by ourselves, this would've been a OK experience where if we would about to come again we would only eat steak without a truffle and skip the fish soup.",

I can certainly say, it's worth the little extra effort.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a beautiful setting on the banks of the Rhine River, and it offers stunning views of the city skyline. It's got a lovely warm and welcoming ambience, and we were seated in a wonderful table by the windows overlooking the river.\n\nAs soon as we walked through the front door, we were greeted with a warm welcome and very friendly service. Goran, as well as all the front of house team, gave us exemplary service – they were all truly fantastic.\n\nThe menu at OX Royal features a variety of high-quality steaks, as well as other meat and seafood dishes. I started with the goats cheese salad, which was delicious, and for main course I had the Wagyu steak. The steak was cooked to perfection, and served with a variety of delicious sides. For dessert we shared a chocolate fondant which was absolutely sublime – true chocolate heaven.\n\nI can see why OX Royal has such fantastic reviews on Google and TripAdvisor. The food is excellent, the service is wonderful, and the atmosphere is elegant and sophisticated. I highly recommend OX Royal to anyone looking for a special dining experience in Cologne.",

We were both very  happy with the high level of detail, first with their acting and second with the room we had to escape.\n\nThe venue was easy to find with parking 5 minutes walk away. In total I think the experience lasted about 90 minutes.",

Don't worry, \"Purrsula\" (the talking cat plushie inside the room) is super helpful and will give you hints in exchange for mice!\nSadly no photos were allowed, except one of your group once you finish.\n100% would recommend!\nThank you Team X!",

It's a small venue, so attention to the little things is hugely important - and they nailed it.\n\nWe were lucky enough to sit at the counter (it's an open kitchen), giving us a front-row seat to the magic. The service appeared effortless while maintaining the absolute highest standards. The chefs hardly spoke, yet everything ran like clockwork - it almost felt like the executive chef was communicating telepathically with his team.\n\nThe service was exceptional. Each course came with an in-depth explanation of the ingredients and techniques used. We opted for the wine pairing, which I'd highly recommend - if you're enjoying a meal like this, the pairing really completes the experience. Just like the food, each wine was introduced with thoughtful details about its origins and flavour profile.\n\nAbsolutely 100% recommend this restaurant if you're after a top-tier dining experience in an intimate setting.",

Tour well planned and we enjoyed it. Beverages were ok.\nBut: having a hen party on board, made it impossible to hear the PA System and was quite disturbing with all the noise most of the time! Unfortunately it really spoiled the tour.\n\nEdit: It is unfortunate to read that customer concerns are not taken seriously according to the situation and are even rather arbitrarily ignored.",

Simply a grainy recording on broken speakers. They oversold seats so tables were not available. Despite this you can't order at the bar as they only serve via \"table service\". Took 35 minutes and four attempts at the bar before I was able to get a drink. They were quick to take my money though.\n\nNext time I would rather swim in the Rhein with concrete shoes than go on this torture cruise again",

I found myself exiting rides, feeling nauseous already, only to walk into a wall of toxic smoke making me feel disgusting. The only place you can go to escape it is the queue of another ride, so that's what we did.\nThe food is on the expensive side, but there are cheaper options and we took our own snacks to supplement. Recommend doing this if cost is a concern.\nA number of rides were closed on our visit but the ones we did go on were good, well managed, no technical difficulties. We didn't check our small bags and they were fine to be stored while we went on most rides.\nAgree that the shuttle bus feels like a scam. €5 for a return trip when you have to wait 30 min for it feels excessive.\nI tried it, I didn't vomit, I probably wouldn't return.",

Some we did not see because they were hiding or somewhere else but there was still plenty others to see. We loved the dinosaurs too!  Stopped by the restaurant for some lunch which was also very nice. Lots of bees/wasps flying around while we were seated eating, so maybe not a great place if you are allergic, but otherwise really nice. Bathrooms were easy to find and it was easy getting in and out. Loved how playful the others were being! Thank you from the US!!",

So, if you want to give your children a treat, buy the Dino kombi ticket with the sticker album. Do so online to jump the queue on site. I highly recommend to also book the Dino VR experience in advance - it is a ten minute visual aid (in coop with local VR hero TimeRide) and adds to the animatronics dinos scattered throughout the park.\nOtherwise, the 14 dinos add a nice distraction to the regular inhabitants of the lovely zoo. Some are animated, others really huge. One of the oldest zoos of Germany sports some nice attractions but also undergoes some considerable refurbishments. Some areas are closed off,  others are currently under construction (giraffe house).\nBut some historic buildings (old elephant house) surely add to the flavor.\nWe paid €98 for two adults and 2 kids. So plan to bring your healthy snacks and drinks with you, otherwise better top up your Amex ;)",

The ambiance was warm and inviting, and the décor exuded a touch of Mediterranean charm. We were warmly greeted by the staff, who were incredibly kind and professional throughout the entire evening.\n\nFor our special occasion, we opted for the Valentine's Day package, which offered a curated selection of exquisite dishes. The presentation of each course was visually stunning, and the flavors were an explosion of culinary artistry. From the melt-in-your-mouth appetizers to the decadent dessert, every bite was a testament to the chef's talent and passion.\n\nWhile pictures can capture the beauty of the food, they simply cannot convey the full experience. The aroma of fresh herbs and spices, the delightful clinking of glasses, and the warm smiles of the staff all contributed to this unforgettable evening.\n\nPhaedra Restaurant surpassed our expectations in every way. It wasn't just a meal; it was a sensory experience that left us feeling cherished and deeply satisfied. As my patner said, We will definitely be back soon, not just for special occasions, but to experience the magic of Phaedra again and again.",

The views across the Rhine River towards the Cologne Cathedral and the old city are simply breathtaking – perfect for photos or just soaking in the scenery.\nWhat I loved most was the sheer variety of things to do. You can take leisurely strolls or bike rides along the well-maintained paths, enjoy a picnic on the expansive lawns, or simply relax and watch the boats go by. There are also dedicated areas for sports, including beach volleyball courts and skate parks, making it a great place for active individuals.\nFor families, Rheinpark is fantastic. There are multiple playgrounds that cater to different age groups, keeping the little ones entertained for hours. The miniature railway is also a delightful experience for children (and adults!).\nThe park is beautifully landscaped with vibrant flowerbeds, mature trees providing ample shade, and even a Japanese garden offering a tranquil escape. It's clear that a lot of care and attention goes into maintaining this space.\nThroughout the year, Rheinpark also hosts various events and festivals, adding to its appeal. Even on a regular day, the atmosphere is lively and welcoming.\nAccessibility is also a strong point, with plenty of entrances and good public transport links.\nOverall, Rheinpark Cologne is a fantastic urban oasis that provides a welcome respite from the city bustle. Whether you're a local or a tourist, spending time in this park is a truly enjoyable experience. Highly recommended!",

He kindly offered us tastings of both white and red wine to help us decide which to start with, and he took the time to explain the menu in great detail, allowing us to make the best choices. The food and the atmosphere were absolutely amazing! The white wine was a perfect match, and the special menu beetroot dish was simply out of this world!\n\nWhat truly stood out was Angelo's exceptional service. Despite the restaurant being fully booked, when 6 more friends suddenly joined us, Angelo worked his magic and managed to set up another table for us. Throughout the night, he was always there to help, from opening windows to accommodating more requests, including setting up a second table for an additional 8 guests.\n\nIt was our last night in Koln, and thanks to Angelo, it was made even more special. We can't thank him enough for his efforts and for making our evening so memorable.❤️",

I paid 42€ and I feel like it was waste of money. In my opinion and as a chocolate lover I expected more  free chocolate samples for that price. Too much historical information and stuff nothing exciting or interesting. Maybe put some fun chocolate activities there.\nThe staff were nice by the way especially the lady with glasses who welcomed me at the front gate and provided some information about tickets etc she was so kind and funny and cute 😍",

Thank you for sharing all the samples of chocolate and I cannot wait to bring my little daughters some time from US! They would adore this as much as I did.

As Michelin notes, the ambiance reflects “lively chatter and lots of laughter,” blending top‑tier gastronomy with Cologne's easy‑going spirit  .\n\nHighlights include a mackerel riff on Caesar salad-yellowtail, caviar, calamansi gel, anchovy bread crisps, Reypenaer cheese-and playful nods to local tradition like Halve Hahn  . Every bite exhibits thoughtful ingredient pairing and impeccable technique. The optional wine or non‑alcoholic pairings are equally imaginative.\n\nWhether opting for meat or vegetarian, the entire dining experience feels artful yet unforgettable.

The gardens are massive and there are so many paths and different sections so it keeps it interesting as you're always seeing something new. It's incredible how many different species of plants they have.",

The gardens are free to entry and are a brief walk away from the train terminal. You need to walk between the Zoo and Aquarium, this makes it a interesting excursion as you could also factor these in on your visit.\n\nThe gardens themselves were well maintained and beautiful. There are plenty of benches around for you to sit on to take in the beauty of the area. On our visit the cafe/bar wasn't open so would advise to bring some drinks/snacks with you depending on how long you intend to explore.\n\nThere are a couple of toilets around the site which cost 50 cents, these are clean and well maintained.",
