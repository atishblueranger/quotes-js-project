However, you can opt for a short ferry ride to Cheung Sha Beach instead. Divided into upper and lower sections, the lower area is bustling with bars and restaurants while the upper section offers a serene cove away from the crowds. It's just a ten-minute walk from the lower section and provides a more tranquil beach experience with ample space and privacy.",
