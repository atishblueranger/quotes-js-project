        "detail_description": "Porte Cailhau, a castle-like gate built in 1495, served as the main entry point to Bordeaux. It functioned as a defensive fortification during conflicts and also welcomed dignitaries and hosted ceremonies due to its Gothic and Renaissance architectural styles. The sculptures on the gate pay homage to King Charles VIII. Originally situated by the river bank, it now stands as a reminder of the city's medieval fortifications.",
