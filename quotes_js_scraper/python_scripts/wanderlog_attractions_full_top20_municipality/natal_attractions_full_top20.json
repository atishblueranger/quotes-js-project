        "detail_description": "The Metropolitan Cathedral in Natal is a modern, minimalist church that contrasts sharply with its Gothic counterparts in the city. The only visible circular feature is the large altarpiece at the front, while all other elements are straight and plain. The cathedral's interiors are also full of clean lines and there is little ornamentation to be seen. This stark modernity is perhaps most evident in the liturgical ceremonies which take place here every week.",
