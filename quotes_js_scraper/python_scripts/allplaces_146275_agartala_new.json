Anjuna Beach, a sandy cove dotted with palms and black rocks, was a well-known destination among hippies in the 1960s. Today it's known for its electronic music trance parties. Each Wednesday, a sprawling flea market sells handicrafts, jewelry and food. North of the beach is St. Anthony's Chapel, an old church with a whitewashed facade.",

Seems like the management has changed and the staff are extremely attentive now. Ambience is even better than before with beautiful decks overlooking the beach. Service was great while we were there. The ambience is beautiful and the choice of music makes it even better compared to the competition. Please don't go here expecting gourmet food. Food is decent but the location and the ambience is what makes this place.",

Based on the same doctrine, Chapora Fort is strategically located on a high hill feature on the southern bank of the Chapora estuary.\nFort has an all-around clear view from its commanding height.\nThe complete hillside and the fort are surrounded by lush greenery and look beautiful. The view from the fort is simply amazing.\nFor the fort, full marks for its scenic beauty and the amazing 360-degree view it offers of the surroundings.\nWhat is wrong is the neglect by the civic authorities.\n​Signage giving direction to the fort and to the parking areas is woefully inadequate.​ Parking areas need better management. At the fort itself, the Signage, the information boards are totally faded and can not be read. Fort also needs to be provided with strategically located small gazebo-like shelters where visitors can relax in the shade or be protected from the rain.",

We ordered Street-Style Chowmein, Stuffed Tandoori Mushrooms, and Fries with Cheese Sauce – all of which were delicious and tasty.\n\nA standout element of our experience was their Mocktails – beautifully crafted and bursting with flavor. For mocktail lovers, I highly recommend trying the Purple Cooler, Yellow Mellow, and Yellow Jive. Each had its own unique taste and was so much refreshing.\n\nYes, the food and drinks are on the pricier side, but given the seaside location, quality foods, Drinks  and exceptional service by the staff, it feels justified.\n\nA small suggestion for the management – improving the pathway leading to Purple Martini would greatly enhance the overall experience, as the nearby roads are quite rough and another some correction needed on Google maps as last 200 meter distance path is not showing properly to reach destination.\n\nAll in all, Purple Martini offers an unforgettable experience, and I would absolutely recommend it for Goa visitors.",

Nestled near Vagator Beach, you don't need an address to find it-just follow the rhythm of laughter, music, and joy that fills the air. The ambiance is spectacular, with stunning sea views, open-air seating, and fairy lights that create a dreamy festive vibe.\n\nEvery evening here feels like a carnival. Asia's finest belly dancers take center stage, while aerial acts and fiery flame shows light up the night sky. Live music flows through the crowd, making it impossible not to sway along. The energy is infectious-vibrant people from around the world come together to celebrate life the Goan way.\n\nBooking in advance is essential; we made our reservation a month ahead for the office season. During peak time, last-minute tables are nearly impossible to get. The price is around ₹2500 per head, fully redeemable on food and drinks-and every penny feels worth it.\n\nThe food is fantastic-Greek and Goan flavors blend perfectly-and the cocktails are pure art.\n\nThalassa doesn't just serve meals; it serves memories you'll cherish forever. 🌅🍹💃",

He made us wait almost 20–30 minutes, and then took us to a table squeezed in between two others. It felt very uncomfortable, especially when you're paying 8–9k for a night out. When we asked for a better spot, his reply was “be open minded” – honestly not the kind of response you'd expect. After a lot of back and forth, he finally gave us a proper table, which was much better.\n\nFrom there, things picked up. The food was tasty (a little overpriced, but that's expected here), and the live show was absolutely fantastic. Great music, amazing performances, and the male belly dancer really stole the show, he was the star of the night!\n\nSo yeah, a rocky start but in the end we had a memorable evening.",

            "text": "I recently visited this beach with the hope of enjoying a relaxing day by the sea, but unfortunately, the experience turned out to be quite disappointing for several reasons.\n\nThe beach feels extremely congested. The number of shacks, restaurants, and bars set up right along the shoreline leaves very little open space to actually enjoy the beach or its views. There's hardly any breathing room, and it's difficult to find a peaceful spot to sit and relax. It seems like every inch of the beach is commercialized, which seriously takes away from the natural charm and openness you'd typically expect at a beach.\nAnother downside was the constant pestering from locals trying to sell water sports activities. While it's understandable that water sports are a part of the beach economy, it becomes frustrating when you're approached every few minutes, even after politely declining. It really disrupts the peace and makes it hard to enjoy your time.\nMost of the restaurants and beach shacks are quite overpriced, especially for the quality and portion size offered. Even basic refreshments or snacks are charged at premium rates, which seems to be targeting tourists rather than offering fair value. If you're planning to spend a day here, be prepared for high prices without necessarily getting a premium experience.",
