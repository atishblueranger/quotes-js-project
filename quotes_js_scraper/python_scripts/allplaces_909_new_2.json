At every 200 m achivement milestones are there. Branch passages are there inside the forest. Seating arrangements & dustbin are placed in close intervals. So, properly maintained and planned forest. An open gym is there. Nursery of orchid, fern and many more. Small birds collection, Rabbits are there. You can find various birds , squirrel 🐿️ in the woods. Just go inside the jungle and seat for a while, but one problem is there, mosquito. You can't ignore them. Many couples find themselves good inside the forest, so, some times it may be difficult to find any vacant seat. However you can have a good walking exercise of 2 km enjoying the forest. Have some exercise in the open gym. For returning to the Agartala station, many auto and other transportation options are there. Gate closing time 18:00 hrs .\nOverall my experience was very good. Really it is like the lap of mother nature. Must visit site.\nMust recommended. 👍",

The food was overall good, delicious, pricing was affordable, the quantity was also perfect 💯 One thing I didn't like is the cleanliness of the place for which I couldn't give them 5 🌟 They have to regularly clean the place, especially the corner of the table it would make anyone feel uncomfortable. Secondly, there was a card saying beer anytime, anywhere and when we ask them for one they said they don't have 😂 than why put the card on each table saying that quote 🙂 Overall a good place not much photogenic, good environment, have AC for summer days.

But one important piece of advice to the ladies/girls: if you have not visited yet & are planning to visit the place, most importantly, if you are planning to explore the whole area, please don't wear heels/stilettos/block heels/platforms or wedges. Wear comfortable shoes or flats. It's tough to climb the high stairs. But visit at least once in your life; the place is really worth visiting.",

There's no point going there just for the spot from Agartala.... If you are visiting elsewhere and take a detour it's okay.  Travelling 8-10 hours for 30 min tour, you really have to decide whether it's worth or not.\nAll the rock carvings are at one side of a hill, at one sight you can see all that's  there.  Not a big place like Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu where the rock structures and carvings strech miles and miles.\nThe place is good no doubt but whether you want to take a drive of 8-10 hrs for a spot you'll cover within minutes is totally your call.",

The dome is surmounted by a stupa-like structure which reveals traces of Buddhist influence. This temple was built in honour of fourteen deities, together called the Chaturdasha Devata.\nDevotees visit the temple for the kharchi festival.\nOld Agartala is 6km away from the present Capital City of Agartala where the Temple of fourteen Gods is located. Before 1770 A.D the images of Fourteen Gods were in Udaipur in two Temples beside Tripureswar Bhairab Temple. In 1770 A.D Maharaja Krishna Kishore Manikya being defeated by Shamsher Gaze, shifted his capital from Udaipur to Old Agartala and the images of Fourteen Gods were also taken to the capital and installed in a new Temple. Capital was once more shifted to the present Agartala in 1840 A.D. but the images of Fourteen Gods remained in the same Temple at Agartala.\n\nOn the occasion of the special puja of the Fourteen Gods known as ‘Kharchi Puja', a grand mela or fair is held for 7 days in and around the Old palace. It is a popular religious shrine where thousands of devotees across the country assemble to celebrate Kharchi Festival with great pomp.\n\nThe worship of the Fourteen Gods has an old history and legend associated with it. During the time of Mahabharata, Trilochana, a contemporary of Yudhisthira, was the king of Tripura who used to worship these Fourteen Gods as Royal deities. The tradition continued with all the subsequent Kings of Tripura. Kharchi Puja observed during the month of Ashar (July) is very famous in Tripura. Animal sacrifices offered by the devotees are an integral feature of Kharchi puja. Inside the temple the images of Fourteen Gods do not consist of full body- only the images of heads of the Gods are there.\n\nHAVELI MUSEUM: the additional for the tourist attraction at Old Agartala is a museum of living cultural heritage i. e. Haveli Museum.\n\nAccording to traditions, the origin for the worship of these deities was contemporary to the setting of the Mahabharata, during the reign of Yudhishthira. They state that the god Shiva, after the death of Tripur (one of Tripura's legendary ancient kings), promised to grant a son and heir to his widow. However, the god stipulated that worship of the Chaturdasa Devata be duly and regularly observed in the kingdom in return. Historically, it is believed that the indigenous Tripuri people of Tripura had adjusted their native culture and religion with that of Hinduism when the latter's influence reached the region. The non-Brahman high priests, the Chantai, continued to minister their rites and rituals, but absorbed the important Hindu deities, resulting in their national pantheon transforming into the Chaturdasa Devata, with the deities being identified with a corresponding Brahmanical name.",

Its library is well-stocked with academic resources, and students find the canteen and basic amenities satisfactory. The campus also includes separate hostel facilities, sports grounds, and academic blocks, making it a well-rounded institution for higher learning.\nHowever, some challenges have been noted. Administrative issues have occasionally caused concern among students, with reports of nepotism and inefficiency sparking protests in the past. Infrastructure in certain areas requires further improvement to meet modern standards, though overall, the university continues to function effectively.\nTripura University has steadily improved its ranking but still faces competition from other central universities in terms of research output and facilities. Despite these challenges, the academic environment and dedicated faculty make it a favorable choice for students seeking higher education in Tripura.\nOverall, Tripura University provides a supportive and focused learning atmosphere. While administrative and infrastructure improvements are necessary, the university's strengths in faculty, discipline, and campus environment make it a respectable institution for students from Tripura and neighboring states.",

The roads leading to the sanctuary are well-maintained and there are basic amenities available for visitors. However, it is advisable to carry your own refreshments and essentials if planning a longer visit as there is no food stall available inside. Avoid throwing plastic and littering inside the zoo.",

            "text": "Today, I visited Sepahijala Park, and overall, it was a pleasant experience. The journey itself was enjoyable, and the park is situated in a lovely location, making it easily accessible and visually appealing. Upon arriving, I noticed that the traffic quality around the park was moderate, which made the commute manageable without much hassle. The staff at the park were well-behaved, polite, and helpful, contributing positively to the overall experience.\n\nThe park's layout and surroundings were quite impressive. It is clear that a lot of thought has gone into its design and maintenance. The natural beauty of the location adds to its charm, creating a serene and welcoming atmosphere for visitors. The park is a great place for families, friends, or individuals looking to spend some quality time amidst nature.\n\nHowever, one aspect of the park that stood out, albeit not in a positive way, was the way the animals were housed. All the animals were kept in cages, which gave the park an unappealing and somewhat outdated look. While it is understandable that cages are often necessary for the safety of both the animals and visitors, the overall aesthetic of the park suffered as a result. The sight of the animals in confined spaces was somewhat disheartening, as it did not reflect the natural habitats they deserve. This aspect of the park could definitely be improved by adopting more modern and humane enclosure designs that mimic natural habitats. Doing so would not only enhance the park's appearance but also improve the quality of life for the animals.\n\nDespite this shortcoming, my visit to Sepahijala Park was a delightful experience. The park offers an excellent opportunity to reconnect with nature and observe various animals up close, which can be especially educational for children. The moderate traffic, courteous staff, and beautiful location added to the overall appeal, making the visit worthwhile.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is room for improvement, particularly in the way the animals are housed, Shepahijala Park remains a lovely destination for a day out. I hope the park authorities will consider updating the enclosures to create a more aesthetically pleasing and animal-friendly environment. Such improvements would undoubtedly elevate the park's status and make it an even more enjoyable place to visit in the future.",
