      "description": "The Magaliesberg mountains are among the most established on the planet, around multiple times more established than Everest. They extend for 120km from east Pretoria to Rustenburg in the west, isolating the highveld meadows from the bushveld savannah in the north. The mountain includes sheer quartzite precipices, profound ravines shaped by water spillover, some in excess of 100 meters down, great kloofs, and enduring cascades that stream into shimmering pools. The mountains are prevalent with explorers, shake climbers and picnickers who visit the shielded site to look for asylum from the worry of city life.",
