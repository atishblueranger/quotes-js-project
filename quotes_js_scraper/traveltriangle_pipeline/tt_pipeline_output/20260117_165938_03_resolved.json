The finds are displayed in an astounding building \u2013 a center of attraction in itself\u2013 whose structure has really been directed by the site itself. It is fairly amazing that the Museum, located relatively opposite Acropolis, is a staggered structure around a solid center that has indistinguishable measurements just as the boundary of Parthenon, though the visit inside the museum in a way bears a resemblance to the scaling the Acropolis rock. The Acropolis museum has been awarded as the \u2018best museum in the world' by the \u2018British Guild of Travel Writers'.",

The gallery was established in the nineteenth century to house the finds that the unearthing in Olympia always uncovered. Nonetheless, as a developing abundance of ancient rarities continued aggregating, even following a century-long archeological research, and because of the high seismicity of the territory, it ended up clear that the exquisite nineteenth-century building would not get the job done. The new gallery of Olympia was worked in the decade 1966-1975 and from that point forward it experienced a noteworthy rearrangement of its presentation zones in 2004, in perspective of the Olympic Games held in Athens.",
