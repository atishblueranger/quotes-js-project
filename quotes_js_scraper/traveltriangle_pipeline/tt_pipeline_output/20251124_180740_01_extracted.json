      "description": "Also known as Tashichho Dzong, or simply, Thimphu Dzong, this is surely one of the most interesting places to visit in Thimphu. This grand fort also serves the venue for country's biggest annual festival tsechu. The dzong is not the original Thimphu Dzong as the palace has been destroyed in fires almost five times till date. Last renovated in 1962 by the then King Jigme Dorji Wangchuck, the fort has the secretariat, offices of the King and other officials and ministers as well as the throne room. Known for its signature white-red-gold combination of colours and tiered roofs, the place offers a deep insight into Bhutanese past.",

      "description": "The best place in Bhutan to observe Takin, the national animal, this preserve was, in fact, a zoo some years back. Then the fourth King of Bhutan decided against the establishment as he felt the idea of a zoo was not in sync with the Bhutanese culture and their idea of environment as well as religion. As the zoo was dismantled, the animals being held there were freed to go back in the wild. Interestingly, the flock of Takin, which lived in the zoo, had been tamed, resulting in them roaming around the city of Thimphu for food. It was then decided to put them back into the preserve. Best time to visit this place, which is one of the top Thimphu tourist attractions, is in the mornings when the animals gather around the fences to feed.",
