        "description": "Like most of the other previously-mentioned sanctuaries, Shree Swami Narayan Temple, too, exhibits its architectural splendor in a grand way. The interior, as well as the exterior of the temple, has been made with Burmese teak wood, which is considered to be the main reason behind the unparalleled beauty of this temple. Along with Narayan Temple, the shrine complex also houses numerous other edifices, such as Akshar Bhawan, Temple for Women, Rang Mahal, etc. So, if you want to enjoy a serene walk among the deities, then make sure to visit the Shree Swami Narayan Temple at least once during your stay.",
