      "description": "Off the mainstream Dubrovnik beaches map (about 30 km away), the Veliki Zai beach is to the west of the Old Town and near the small village of Brsecine. The beach has gorgeous views of the Dalmatian island of Sipan, and its crystal blue and green waters are a welcome break from the dull colors of Banje of Dance. The beach is perfect for children as the water just off the beach is hardly deep and the bottom is soft.",

      "description": "Pronounced dan-che, the Dance Beach in Dubrovnik is one of the oldest and most amazing beaches you will find in the city. The eastern slopes of the Gradac Park keep the sun away till midday, and sunbathers can lie on rocks here thereafter till sunset. The waters of the Adriatic are much cleaner here than the other Dubrovnik beaches. To get to the beach, you have to get to Gradac Park from where you can just follow the narrow path down to the beach.",

Very popular with locals who detest the tourist crowds, it is located in Babin Kuk that is part of the Lapad peninsula. With a view of the blue mountains and the peninsula, the beach rivals the likes of Banje. It has changing rooms, sun umbrellas for rent, restaurants and cafes, and fruit and ice cream shops, so your day in the sun will be more enjoyable!",

Located right next to East entrance to the famed Old Town, the beach has towering views of the walls and battlements, and you can also see the Lokrum islands from here. It gets very crowded in the summers so the best time to come here may be in September before it becomes too cold. To get to Banje beach in Dubrovnik, you can simply walk from the Old Town to the eastern gate.",

The crescent shaped bay is great if you want to just paddle in. The island's port, which is where your ferry will drop you off, is a 30 minute walk from the Sunj beach, and takes you through the Mediterranean countryside with its flora and fauna in full glory.",
