Well-maintained, Bidar Fort stands tall with pride of its historical significance and is one of the most famous places to visit in Bidar. The origin of this fort is unclear but it saw power during the middle ages when it came under the rule of the Bahmani dynasty and was rebuilt by Sultan Ahmed Shah Wali. Within the fort complex, there is an old city with structures and monuments from the Bahamian era. Among these monuments, Rangin Mahal, Gagan Mahal, and Tarkash Mahal are popular. You can also see notable mosques like Solah Khamba Masjid and Jami Masjid in the fort. The Diwan-i-Am or Jali Mahal, Diwan-i-Khas or Takht Mahal or Throne Palace, and Valkoti Bhavani with few settlements are a few other visiting places in Bidar.",
