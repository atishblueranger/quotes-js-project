        "description": "Looking for a unique honeymoon destination in Italy that is less mainstream than Rome or Venice? Consider Bosa, located on the island of Sardinia. Bosa is known for its colourful hillside town overlooking the sea, medieval castle, churches, museums, and a plethora of beautiful restaurants and shops. The lack of major highways in Sardinia gives the charming town of Bosa and the rest of the island a rustic and exclusive feel. You can explore the stunning coastline through smaller, provincial roads, making for an exciting adventure. Start your day in Bosa with a typical Italian breakfast of espresso and rusks with tomatoes and olive oil, before heading out for the day. If you are an avid hiker, there are numerous nearby trails to discover. Alternatively, you can spend the day sailing on a catamaran and exploring the nearby Maddalena Archipelago.",
