The cultural trek offers picturesque views of the monasteries, temples, and quaint villages. You also get to explore the beautiful villages and experience great hospitality. Until the 1970s, the area was only accessible by muddy trails and mules. Ura Valley is another place lost in the mist of time in Bumthang. Quaint villages with clustered houses, potato fields, and sheep pastures. This is the kind of valley where you can go on a photo walk. Besides the breathtaking mountains and natural beauty, Bumthang valley is blessed with some of the oldest Buddhist temples in Bhutan. It is also the place where Buddhism was first introduced and where saint Pema Lingpa was born.",

Trashiyangtse is also a starting point for hikes to nature reserves, paper workshops, wood carving, and monasteries.
