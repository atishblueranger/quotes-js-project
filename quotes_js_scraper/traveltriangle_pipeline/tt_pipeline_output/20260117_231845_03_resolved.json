One of the best Laos waterfalls in the south, Tat Somphamit is an endless series of water cascades and raging rapids. The aquamarine water beautifully contrasted against the brown rocks that it cuts through, presents a scenic picture. The area is well-laid out with trails, wooden bridges and viewing points that make for great photo ops. There is also a cafe and other facilities, as well as beach for a nice swim (need to be on guard as the current is swift).",
