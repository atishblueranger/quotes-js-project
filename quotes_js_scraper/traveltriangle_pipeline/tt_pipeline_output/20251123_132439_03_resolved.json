It is said that this lake was dug out by the Gods themselves, which makes it a popular retreat and a great spot for boating in Mount Abu, one of the most beautiful hill stations in Rajasthan. But that's not all that fascinates people about this place. Nakki Lake is known to be among the best places near Udaipur, especially to the followers of Gandhi, courtesy of the fact Mahatma Gandhi's ashes were immersed here. It's a serene place to hang out with friends as it is surrounded by plenty of eating joints where you can sit, dine, and gaze at the sunset over the lake!",
