      "description": "It may be one of the least popular waterfalls in Lombok since no one really knows about it, but it also is among the most beautiful. Imagine sitting with your bae before this gorgeous waterfall surrounded by a surreal forest and the sweet chirping of birds, having this utterly magical setting all to yourself with not a single soul around. Sounds fascinating, doesn't it? Guess what, it really is! Other than taking a swim in these waters, you can have a small picnic while you're here. In order to get to the Tiu Pupus waterfall, all you have to do is take a short trek along a well-laid out trail from the carpark that will take you past a small stream and onto this marvelous waterfall. And if you visit after a rain, you'll be met with stunning views of a fiercely roaring waterfall that will make it the perfect backdrop for photos.",
