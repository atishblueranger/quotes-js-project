Just recently turned into a creatively designed commercial center from a quiet fishing village, Kuta now boasts of world-class resorts, dining options and places for shopping, and attracts thousands of visitors from all over the world every year with its distinctive charm. The frenzied traffic scene is a common sight here, as everyone flocks to Kuta for a pleasant Bali experience. Make your hotel bookings well in advance, as finding a good place to stay here during the peak season from July to August and the holiday season for Christmas and New Year can be a problem.",

This all-inclusive tourist destination owes its phenomenal development and escalating popularity to the Indonesian Tourism Development Centre or ITDC (formerly Bali Tourism Development Centre or BTDC). Nusa Dua is the most developed area in Bali which houses luxurious 5-star properties on one hand and beautiful temples and museums on the other, both equally contributing to its charm.

One can get to Suluban Beach, or Blue Point, from popular areas such as Kuta and Jimbaran via hotel shuttles, taxis or motorbikes. Canopied by a looming cliff face, the coastline also features a number of locally-run caf-s, surfboard rentals, and art shops. The mysterious looking cavern leading up to the beach also serves as an ideal spot for camping in Bali where travelers can pitch their tents and simply stare at the azure waters and sky from their snug shelters, the prime reason why travelers say its among the best hidden beaches in Bali. Other than the beach, one can explore the beachs several rocky openings, mini caves, and tide pools inviting beach bums for a pleasurable dip.",

The steep descent and the climb downwards require great stamina and guts, which is why this small beach is a favorite weekend retreat for adrenaline junkies. With a large reef barrier and two large limestone caves enclosing petite rock shrines and providing shelter to beach bums relaxing on the grainy white sand, this exotic beach has the most matchless features against any other beach in Bali. One has to wait for the low tide to tread its water for surfing and snorkeling, or even consider setting foot on the beach, as it gets flooded up to the cliffs rock face during high tide! Dont forget to check out the nearby temple and enjoy the panoramic views of blue, white and green from the cliff top before getting down to the beach.

The beach owes its names to the many wanderers who discovered it. Travelers who were struck with its pristine stretch of silky sand with fabulous views of the small rocky islet of Gili Biaha far in the horizon gave it the name Virgin Beach. Furthermore, those who were bowled over by its unique combination of boulders wedged in the white sand and calmer waves in comparison to the nearby shores labeled it as the White Sand Beach. Getting to the secluded coast of Pasir Putih Beach is an adventure in itself. A kilometer long dirt tracks, rocky terrains, and narrow passageways lead you down to the shore once your vehicle is safely parked in the parking lot above.

        "description": "This serene half a kilometer stretch of coastline marks Balis least visited, yet inexplicably surreal beaches offering the best of surfs to wave riders and majestic views to love birds and nature lovers. Located a mile away from the renowned Uluwatu Temple, the beach is tucked away in a far-flung, concealed location and demands travelers to engage in long, tiring treks to reach it and bask in its beauty. Trek on the rugged terrain while enjoying splendid views of the limestone hillside enriched with greenery, and the company of sounds and views of the waves lapping the shores beneath you. When here, one can take a walk down the deserted beach and relish amazing sights of broad grassy plains, sandy shores, slanting cliffs, thin mists hanging above the ocean, swaying fields, natural reefs breaking the water, and a lone split shipwreck on the sand. The beach also serves as a camping site for die-hard photographers and travelers who come here to witness the breathtaking sunset and then enjoy a bonfire under the blanket of stars. Located on Nyang Nyangs western half is the only food stall on the beach where you can buy drinks, snacks, and colorful beach clothes.",

Other than surfing, simply walking on the stretch of white sand on the most beautiful coastline of Bukit Peninsula covered with scattered boulders and rock pools is an experience in itself. Treading in the water isnt easy due to the presence of jagged rocks, but the gorgeous beachscapes and the thrill of being knocked over by strong waves pushes travelers to try. Apart from surfing, Bingin is also a treat for photographers and filmmakers who come here to capture Balis offbeat, yet picturesque landscapes. Even the barren cliffs overhead offer the best panoramic views in the area. The best time for surfing here is during low tide.",

Though it was earlier only frequented by wedding photographers due to its exotic backdrops, the beach has recently gained popularity when its barren beauty started getting eyeballs of the public, especially honeymooners. The best time to visit this beach is before sunset, or the blue hour (6-7 PM).

Another unique aspect of this beach are the two small river mouths that border both ends of the beach. Apart from being known for its black sand and streams, Nelayan beach is also popular among international tourists for its seclusion and quiet sunsets. Nelayan is among the best beaches in Bali to stay at owing to its many luxury villas like Tirtarum Villas and Nelayan Villas offering comfortable accommodation options and the finest of dining experiences in the area. One should ideally visit at dawn to witness delightful vistas of fishermen hauling their wooden outriggers on the sands and unloading their early morning catches. Strike up a friendly conversation with them and you can easily be taking home some fresh fish, lobsters, prawns, squids, and more. It is easy to get to this beach if one simply follows Jalan Nelayan road that branches off from Jalan Batu Bolong.",

The islands are highly popular for its diverse diving sites as the waters around them boast of rich tropical marine biodiversity and good visibility throughout the year. The largest and most popular of these is Gili Trawangan owing to its well-established infrastructure and world-class facilities. A great spot for diving for first timers, the island's beaches have a plethora of great hotels, bars, and restaurants, catering to different types of visitors and their preferences. While the main coast near the harbor offers a castaway style nightlife to party animals, the secluded beaches on the other side offer peace and tranquillity to couples and honeymooners.",
