Quaint villages with clustered houses, potato fields, and sheep pastures. This is the kind of valley where you can go on a photo walk. Besides the breathtaking mountains and natural beauty, Bumthang valley is blessed with some of the oldest Buddhist temples in Bhutan.

Born out of Trashigang district in 1992 as a separate district, it sits in the middle of a small river valley, making it an ideal place for long, refreshing walks in the countryside. Another one of the best things to do in Bhutan is explore one of the most important stupas – Chorten Kora, situated next to the Kulong Chu River in Trashiyangtse. Trashiyangtse is also a starting point for hikes to nature reserves, paper workshops, wood carving, and monasteries. If you're interested in bird-watching nearby, then a long walk to Bomdeling Wildlife Sanctuary, which is home to Black-necked Cranes that migrate from Tibet in winter. Bomdeling is also popular for its brilliant woodcraft.",
