      "description": "One of the most famous waterfalls in Tanzania is the Themi waterfall, which is formed by one of the parts of Themi river that flows into the Themi valley. What makes this waterfall different from all the other ones is that it flows from an underground stream, and keeps flowing until it hits the end and flows to the bottom, creating a 15-meter long fall. The water in these is so clear and clean, that it is considered to be the purest form of water, and is used by the people who live in the nearby villages for their daily life. Another point of interest near the waterfalls are the many small celery farms, all of which use the water from the falls to water their fields.",

The location of this waterfall creates the perfect environment for a harmony between plants and animals, with many exotic plant species and animals such as monkeys, antelopes, and beautiful butterflies flying around the forest.",
