There is a pleasant prospect of Kochelsee, the Loisach Kochelsee marsh, and the Benediktbeuer Monastery. The remainder of the track passes through open grassland to the Jochberg peak trial. On a cloudless day, you can view as far as Munich (across Walchensee, Stamberg Lake, Kochelsee, Ammersee, and Staffelsee) from beyond. From Wendelstein and Karwendel range, you can see the Achensee ranges, the Wetterstein hills (comprising Zugspitze) along with the Stubai Alps. As you move down the alpine meadows southward, you lead towards the Jocher-Alm just in less than 20 minutes, whose intense fare will delight you. (It offers carnal fare from mid of May to the September end, Mondays off). Then the tracks head eastward across the alpine grassland and up to Kotalm (that does not serve eatery fare) and then through a jungle road and track back to Kochel am See.",

The plateau is gouged out with copious caves (including the biggest German cave), however also has a hut named the Stöhrhaus. Making this journey in a single day is plausible. However, it is much pleasanter and comfortable if performed as a weekend tour cover over two days, spending the night at the Stöhrhaus. This is a 1972 meter hiking trip that holds a moderate difficulty level, and it will take about 10 hours to traverse the journey without being stopping.",

      "description": "It is a favorite hiking spot for a broad range of trekking passionate. The canyon itself is actually in Austria, though it is simply approachable through a roadway from Germany. As the Kleinwalsertal is pretty away from Munich, it is perfect to plan an entire hiking weekend along with enjoying the nightlife at any of the provincial hill huts. This was our favored track for a weekend tour, which we toured a large part of, yet didn't manage whole of it because of the poor weather condition. This is a great trekking route with a distance of 2013 metre with a medium difficulty level. It will take on an average of 10 hours if you trek the route continuously without many breaks.",
