The house itself bears characteristics of tropical architecture with about 109 doors and a large number of rooms to keep the place cool even in scorching summers. The place houses many antiques, pieces of furniture and maps dating back to the French East India Company along with servant quarters and kitchens. Truthfully, this is the one historical building in Mauritius you should not miss, no matter what!",
