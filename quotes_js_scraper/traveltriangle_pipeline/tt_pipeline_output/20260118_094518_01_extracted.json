George Vaughan and his relatives utilised the cabin farmhouse as their estate for a long time, cultivating around 2000 sections of land and its surrounding areas. Following quite a long while of restorative work, the residence was changed into a network exhibition hall which is opened to people in general by appointment or in chosen hours.",
