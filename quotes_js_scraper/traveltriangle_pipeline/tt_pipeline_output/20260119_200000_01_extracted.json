      "description": "If one acquires the “Boston Waterfalls Map” from any one of the numerous tourist info-kiosks at the hotels of Boston, one would immediately notice the big bad boy of waterfalls in the state of Massachusetts, the Bash Bish Falls. Situated exactly at the south-west border of the State, one can also easily cross the border into the Taconic State Park in New York and thus lay claim to visiting two states on the same day. The best way to have a pleasant experience is to hike but beware of the steep climb involved. The falls are open from sunrise and close at 30 minutes past sunset, perfect enough to capture the sun-set from atop the falls.",

      "description": "These man-made falls were once natural waterfalls and were the fishing grounds for the Pennacook Indians. Located in Lowell, on the Merrimack River, this waterfall drops a total of 32 feet. For those history buffs, this fall is of significant importance as the Lowell Power Canal System was set up in this region, thus ushering in America's industrial revolution. The canal system meant the natural Pawtucket falls went dry and the current waterfall is nothing but a loss of elevation which occurs when there is heavy flow topping the dam. Visitors get a good view from the bridge over the Merrimack River.",
