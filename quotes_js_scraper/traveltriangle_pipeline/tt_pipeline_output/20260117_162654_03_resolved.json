On a cloudless day, you can view as far as Munich (across Walchensee, Stamberg Lake, Kochelsee, Ammersee, and Staffelsee) from beyond. From Wendelstein and Karwendel range, you can see the Achensee ranges, the Wetterstein hills (comprising Zugspitze) along with the Stubai Alps. As you move down the alpine meadows southward, you lead towards the Jocher-Alm just in less than 20 minutes, whose intense fare will delight you. (It offers carnal fare from mid of May to the September end, Mondays off). Then the tracks head eastward across the alpine grassland and up to Kotalm (that does not serve eatery fare) and then through a jungle road and track back to Kochel am See.",
