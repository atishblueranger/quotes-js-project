The village is situated on the Puri highway and is home to appliqué work. Artists from this village stitch chariot covers of the world-famous Jagannath Rath Yatra. The craft had initially originated to serve temples and offers intricately stitched awnings along with covers for deities. There are hangings available for the festival days and detailing on the craft. All the crafts and the shopping accessories makes this one of the ideal tourist places around Bhubaneshwar.",
