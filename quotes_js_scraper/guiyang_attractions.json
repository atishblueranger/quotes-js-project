    "detail_description": "Qianling Mountain Park, in the northwest of the city, is more forest than park. It's a great escape from the crowds and city noise and has some lovely paths up to the Hongfu Temple.\nQianling is known locally as 'monkey park' and you're certain to spot some of its furry inhabitants, not least because many visitors to the park feed them. Note that feeding these supposedly wild macaques is not technically allowed, although no one enforces this rule."

Near the top of 1300m Qianling Mountain (黔灵山, Qiánlíng Shān), Hongfu Temple dates back to the 17th century and is reached via an easy 40-minute walk (or a cable car if you don't feel up to it). The on-site monastery has a decent vegetarian restaurant in the rear courtyard.\n"
