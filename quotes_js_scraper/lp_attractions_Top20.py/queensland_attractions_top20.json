        "detail_description": "Riddling the Berserker Range some 24km north of Rockhampton, this vast cave complex is one of the Capricorn Coast's foremost attractions. Technically not subterranean (they were formed by water working on the limestone of an ancient reef, thrust upward by tectonic pressure) they contain cave coral, stalactites, dangling fig-tree roots and little insectivorous bats. The most popular (one-hour) tour showcases their remarkable acoustics with a classical-music recording in Cathedral Cave, and is suitable for all ages and most fitness levels.\nThe cathedral has become a popular wedding spot, and hosts several concerts throughout the year. In December, around the summer solstice (1 December to 14 January), sunlight beams through a 14m vertical shaft into Belfry Cave, creating an electrifying light show. If you stand directly below the beam, reflected sunlight colours the whole cavern with whatever colour you’re wearing.There are other tours that focus on palaeontology and fossils. Also, daring spelunkers over 16 years old and of decent fitness can book a two-hour ‘adventure tour’ ($90), which has you crawling through tight spots with names such as ‘Fat Man’s Misery’. A less strenuous family version of this tour is also offered (adult/child $50/40; also two hours long).The Capricorn Caves complex has barbecue areas, a pool, a kiosk and accommodation (powered sites $35, cabins from $150)."

        "detail_description": "The largest of the paradisaical group to which it gives its name, Whitsunday Island is ruggedly forested, and surrounded by clear teal waters and coral gardens. Its most visited site is the dazzling 7km-long Whitehaven Beach – one of Australia's finest – visited by pretty much every sailing/snorkelling tour from Airlie Beach but still managing to seem uncrowded. The more intrepid will also enjoy the Hill Inlet lookout (for epic lagoon views) at the north end of Whitehaven Beach.\nThere are six basic camp sites on the island, some with more shade than others. It's hard to beat the Whitehaven Beach camp site for its five-star location. Book camp sites online with Queensland Parks &amp; Wildlife, and see Scamper for camping transfers ($105 to $155 return per person)."

Exhibitions to date have explored themes as varied as contemporary Brisbane fashion, the city's robust music scene and the relationship between architecture, art, people and place. The result is a snapshot of a metropolis much more complex than many give it credit for.\nThe savvy museum shop stocks locally made jewellery, glassware, ceramics and books, as well as cards and other genuinely cool, Brisbane-themed gifts."

Its standout wines including merlot, saperavi and durif, and a full-bodied fiano more Italian than Australian in style. The winery also harbours the Granite Belt's top restaurant, Barrelroom &amp; Larder. Winery tours (adult/child $5/free) run daily at 11am.\nIf you're feeling romantic, call a day ahead and order one of Ballandean's gourmet picnic hampers ($80 for two), best enjoyed in the vineyard. On Mondays, guided tours are followed by a two-course lunch and wine degustation."
