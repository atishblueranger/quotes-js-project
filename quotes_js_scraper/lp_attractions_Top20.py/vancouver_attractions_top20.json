Designed by infamous architect Francis Rattenbury, the yesteryear, antique-studded rooms have a lived-in feel while its guided tour (included with admission) tells you all about its middle-class Roedde family residents. Look out for the cylinder record player, 250-year-old grandfather clock and the taxidermied deer heads that were hunted in Stanley Park in 1906.\nConsider visiting on Sunday when your $8 ticket includes cookies and tea served in vintage china teacups. This is also one of Vancouver's most evocative live music venues, staging regular jazz or classical concerts (tickets $15) in its downstairs rooms. The home is in Barclay Heritage Square, a one-block site containing nine historic West End houses dating from 1890 to 1908."

        "detail_description": "One of North America’s largest urban green spaces, Stanley Park is revered for its dramatic forest-and-mountain oceanfront views. But there’s more to this 400-hectare woodland than looks. The park is studded with nature-hugging trails, family-friendly attractions, sunset-loving beaches and tasty places to eat. \nWhy you should go\nBuilt in stages between 1917 and 1980, the park's 8.8km seawall trail is Vancouver's favorite outdoor hangout. Encircling the park, it offers spectacular waterfront vistas on one side and dense forest on the other. \nYou can walk the whole thing in roughly three hours or rent a bike to cover the route far faster. Keep in mind: cyclists and in-line skaters must travel counterclockwise on the seawall, so there's no going back once you start (unless you walk). \nAlso consider following the 25km of trails that crisscross the park's interior, including Siwash Rock Trail, Rawlings Trail and the popular Beaver Lake Trail (some routes are for pedestrians only). The Beaver Lake route is especially recommended; a family of beavers resides there and you'll likely spot them swimming around their large den.\n\n  \nThe totems in Stanley Park are a top attraction © Regien Paassen / Shutterstock\n\nThe seawall also delivers you to some of the park's top highlights. About 1.5km from the W Georgia St entrance, you'll come to the ever-popular totem poles. Remnants of an abandoned 1930s plan to create a First Nations 'theme village,' the bright-painted poles were joined by some exquisitely carved Coast Salish welcome arches a few years back. For the full First Nations story, consider a fascinating guided park walk with Talaysay Tours.\nContinue on to the nearby Nine O’Clock Gun (it fires at 9pm nightly) and Lumberman's Arch, which is a good spot to see Alaska cruise ships sliding past. From here, you can cut into the park to the popular Vancouver Aquarium or continue around the seawall; it gets wilder and more scenic as you pass under the Lions Gate Bridge and face down the Pacific Ocean.\nWildlife in Stanley Park \nStanley Park is studded with appeal for wildlife fans. Neat the W Georgia St entrance lies Lost Lagoon, which is a bird-beloved nature sanctuary – keep your eyes peeled for blue herons. Its perimeter pathway is also a favored stroll for wildlife nuts.\nPlunging deeper into the park's more secluded trails, you'll also likely spot wrens, hummingbirds and chittering little Douglas squirrels. For an introduction to the area's flora and fauna, start at the Stanley Park Nature House. You'll find friendly volunteers and exhibits on wildlife, history and ecology – ask about their well-priced guided walks.\nWhile they mostly give humans a wide berth, you might also come across a coyote or two; aggressive incidents with coyotes are rare. However, be cautious and treat them with respect and give them a wide berth as well. \nBeaches in Stanley Park \nSecond Beach is a family-friendly area on the park's western side, with a grassy playground, an ice-cream-serving concession and a huge outdoor swimming pool. It's also close to Ceperley Meadows, where Fresh Air Cinema offers popular free outdoor movie screenings in summer. \nFor a little more tranquility, try Third Beach. A sandy expanse with plenty of logs to sit against, this is a favored summer-evening destination for Vancouverites. \nOpening hours and other practicalities\nThe park is free to enter and open 24 hours a day. The park can be reached by taking bus 19 from downtown. There are additional fees for bike rentals and attractions in the park, like the Vancouver Aquarium. \nIn summer, the seawall is packed with visitors; arrive early morning or early evening if tranquil nature-communing is your bag. There are often summertime queues to enter the aquarium; try to make it one of your first stops when you arrive at the park.\nHotels near Stanley Park \nBuchan Hotel \nTimes Square Suites Hotel \nSylvia Hotel \n \n"

        "detail_description": "May 23, 1887, was an auspicious date for Vancouver. That's when Engine 374 pulled the very first transcontinental passenger train into the fledgling city, symbolically linking the country and kick-starting the eventual metropolis. Retired in 1945, the engine was, after many years of neglect, restored and placed in this splendid pavilion. The friendly volunteers here will show you the best angle for snapping photos and share a few yesteryear railroading stories at the same time.\nAdministered by the West Coast Railway Heritage Park in Squamish (a good excursion for rail buffs), the engine is kept in sparkling condition and is occasionally wheeled out onto the outside turntable, part of the beautifully restored heritage roundhouse that recalls Yaletown's gritty rail-yard history. Visit on Victoria Day (last Monday before May 25) for the pavilion's annual celebration; free cake included."

If not, it's certainly one of the world's most magnificent book-lending facilities. Designed by Moshe Safdie and opened in 1995, its collections (including lendable musical instruments) are arranged over several floors. Head straight up to floor nine for the newly opened Rooftop Garden, a lofty, tree-lined outdoor plaza lined with tables and chairs: it's perfect for a view-hugging coffee break.\nThere's free wi-fi, and computer terminals if you don't have your own device. The library also hosts a lively roster of gratis book readings and events. Save time for the library shop; it's crammed with cool bookish gifts."

Entry includes timed access to this celebrated boat and you can also try your hand at piloting it via a cool wheelhouse simulator.\nRecently marking its 60th anniversary, the museum hosts additional temporary exhibitions throughout the year. Save time to check out the vessels outside the building, including the Ben Franklin, a NASA undersea research vessel that looks a little like the Beatles' Yellow Submarine."

But it really comes to life in its vibrant 1950s pop culture and 1960s hippie counterculture sections, a reminder that Kitsilano was once the grass-smoking center of Vancouver's flower-power movement. Don't miss the shimmering gallery of vintage neon signs collected from around the city; it's a favorite with locals.\nThere are plenty of hands-on exhibits, including push-button tunes from local 1960s bands such as Mock Duck and Seeds of Time. The museum shop also has a well-curated array of T-shirts, local history books and aboriginal-themed arts and gifts. Admission is \"pay what you can\" on the first Sunday of every month."

Guided nature walks are also offered or you can wander the park's trails on your own armed with your new-found wildlife expertise.\nThe guided walks are great value, priced from $7 per person, and you can check the website to see what's on the calendar during your visit. Booking ahead is recommended in summer."

Check the daily schedule of shows and presentations online before you arrive.
