        "detail_description": "This is the largest of Sera’s colleges, generally accessed from a western side entrance. It has a breathtaking main hall, hung with thangkas and lit by shafts of light from high windows. Several chörtens hold the remains of Sera’s most famous lamas. To the left of the hall is a passage leading, via a chapel dedicated to the Past, Present and Future Buddhas, to the most sacred of Sera Monastery’s chapels, the Chapel of Tamdrin.\nTamdrin (Hayagriva) is a wrathful meditational deity whose name means ‘horse headed’. He is the chief protective deity of Sera, and there is often a long line of shuffling pilgrims waiting to touch their – and especially their children’s – foreheads to his feet in respect. Children get a black mark of butter-lamp soot on their noses as a blessing. Monks sell holy threads, protective amulets and sacred pills here, as well as red slips of inscribed paper called tsenik, which pilgrims buy to burn for the recently deceased and newly born. The ornate brass shrine recalls the temples of the Kathmandu Valley. As you queue up to view the shrine, take a look at the weapons, hats and masks hanging from the ceiling. Join the pilgrims in buying a white khatag and throwing it up onto the three Buddha statues.The first chapel to the rear of the hall is devoted to a lovely statue of Sakyamuni, seated below a fine canopy of curling dragons and a ceiling mandala. Pilgrims lean on the steps to the right to touch his left leg. The next two chapels are dedicated to Tsongkhapa, with Sakyamuni and Öpagme (Amitabha), and to Jampelyang, flanked by Jampa and another Jampelyang. From here head to the upstairs chapels, the second of which has a fine embroidered thangka of the fourth Panchen Lama.To the northeast of Sera Je is Sera’s debating courtyard. Photos are allowed on mobile phones but not actual cameras."

        "detail_description": "The magnificent Potala Palace, once the seat of the Tibetan government and the winter residence of the Dalai Lamas, is Lhasa's cardinal landmark. Your first sight of its towering, fortress-like walls is a moment you'll remember for years. An architectural wonder even by modern standards, the palace rises 13 storeys from 130m-high Marpo Ri (Red Hill) and contains more than 1000 rooms. Pilgrims and tourists alike shuffle open-mouthed through the three storeys, past the dozens of magnificent chapels, golden stupas and prayer halls.\nThe first recorded use of the site was in the 7th century AD, when King Songtsen Gampo built a palace here. Construction of the present structure began during the reign of the fifth Dalai Lama in 1645 and took divisions of labourers and artisans more than 50 years to complete. It is impressive enough to have caused Chinese premier Zhou Enlai to send his own troops to protect it from the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution.The layout of the Potala Palace includes the rooftop White Palace (the eastern part of the building), used for the living quarters of the Dalai Lama, and the central Red Palace, used for religious functions. The most stunning chapels of the Red Palace house the jewel-bedecked golden chörten (Tibetan stupa) tombs of several previous Dalai Lamas. The apartments of the 13th and 14th Dalai Lamas, in the White Palace, offer a more personal insight into palace life.Tickets for the Potala are limited and your guide will need to book a time slot several days in advance. Arrive at the palace an hour or so before your allotted time. After a security check (no water or lighters allowed), follow the other visitors to the stairs up into the palace. Halfway up you'll pass the ticket booth, where you'll buy your ticket. Note that if you arrive later than the time on your voucher (or if you forget your voucher) you can be refused a ticket. Photography isn't allowed inside the chapels."

        "detail_description": "The main assembly hall, or Tsogchen, is the principal structure in the Drepung complex and is the one chapel you must not miss. The hall is reached through an entrance on the western side, just past a wonderful medieval-looking kitchen, whose hot-tub-sized cauldrons and giant ladles look like props from the film The Name of the Rose. The butter-tea churner alone is 6ft tall.\nThe assembly hall's huge interior is very atmospheric, draped with thangkas, covered in monks' robes and yellow hats, and supported by over 180 columns – the ones near the western protector chapel dedicated to goddess Palden Lhamo (no women allowed) are decorated with ancient chain mail and bows.The back-room chapel features the protector deities Chana Dorje (Vajrapani, blue) and Tamdrin (Hayagriva, red) on either side of the door, and contains statues of Sakyamuni with his two disciples, the Buddhas of the Three Ages, and nine chörtens above. The walls and pillars are lined with statues of eight standing bodhisattvas. To the front centre there is also a youthful-looking statue of Lamrin Ngawang Phuntsok (a former abbot of Drepung, recognisable by his black-rimmed glasses); next to it is his funeral chörten. To the east is Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Gelugpa sect.Sculptures of interest in the main hall include a two-storey Jampelyang (Manjushri); a small Sakyamuni; a statue of Tsongkhapa that is said to have spoken; the moustached 13th Dalai Lama to the right; the monastery's founder, Jamyang Chöje, in a cabinet to the right; the seventh Dalai Lama; and to the right Sakyamuni, flanked by five of the Dalai Lamas. At the end of the altar you will find a group of eight arhats (literally ‘worthy ones’). In the back room to the right look for the two-storey statue of Jampa and the tombs of monastery founder Jamyang Chöje and Lama Yeshe Ö, the lama from western Tibet who invited Atisha to Tibet in the 11th century. Back in the main hall the long cabinet on the eastern wall holds a huge building-sized thangka that is unveiled during the Shötun festival (there's a photo of it at one end).Back by the main entrance, past a great fire-safety mural, steps lead up to the 1st and 2nd floors. At the top of the stairs is the Hall of the Kings of Tibet, featuring statues of Tibet’s early kings and early Dalai Lamas, including Lobsang Gyatso (the fifth Dalai Lama), and a chapel containing the head of a two-storey Jampa statue. Pilgrims prostrate themselves here, throw kathak (silk scarves) and drink from a sacred conch shell.Continue moving clockwise through the Sakyamuni Chapel, stuffed with chörtens, and then descend to the Miwang Lhakhang. This chapel contains the assembly hall’s most revered image, a massive statue of Jampa, the Future Buddha, at the age of 12. The statue rises through three floors of the building from the ground-floor chapel you saw earlier, and it is flanked by Tsongkhapa to the left and Jamyang Chöje to the right.Next is the Drölma Lhakhang. Drölma is a protective deity, and in this case the three Drölma images in the chapel are responsible for protecting Drepung’s drinking water, wealth and authority respectively. There are also some fine examples of gold-inked Tibetan Kangyur scriptures here. The central statue is a form of Sakyamuni, whose amulet encases one of Tsongkhapa’s teeth.Exit the building from the western side of the 2nd floor."

There are some incredibly ornate yak-butter sculptures in this hall.\nOf the four chapels to the rear of the hall, the central is the most important, with its 6m-high Jampa statue. The statue rises to the upper floor, where it can also be viewed from a central chapel.Also on the upper floor (to the far left of the central chapel) is a highly revered statue of a thousand-armed Chenresig. Pilgrims put their forehead to a walking stick that connects them directly and literally to the heart of compassion. The pilgrim path enters the building from the back, so this may be the first chapel you come across before descending to the prayer hall. Also here is a chapel dedicated to Tsongkhapa.To the west of the assembly hall is an ancient Drölma rock shrine that pilgrims circumambulate."

Women are not allowed into this chapel.Stairs lead to the upper floors and the holy Serdung chapel, which houses Tsongkhapa’s funeral chörten. The chapel is sometimes called the Yangpachen Khang, after the stone in the back left, covered in offerings of yak butter that is said to have flown from India. The images seated in front of the chörten are of Tsongkhapa flanked by his two principal disciples. On the wall is a photo of the Ganden Tripa who rebuilt the funeral chörten. Pilgrims line up to buy votive inscriptions written in gold ink by the monks and later recited during prayer dedications. Protective amulets and high-quality incense are sold outside the chapel."

However, another image, the Jowo Sakyamuni, was later moved here by the king's other wife (the Chinese Princess Wencheng), and it is this image that gives the Jokhang both its name and its spiritual potency: Jokhang means 'chapel of the Jowo'.The two-storeyed Jokhang is best visited in the morning, though the crowds of yak-butter-spooning pilgrims can be thick. Access is possible in the afternoon through a side entrance, but only the ground-floor chapels can be viewed (and then only through a grille) and there are no pilgrims."

        "detail_description": "For those with an interest in Tibetan Buddhism, Drak Yerpa hermitage, about 30km northeast of Lhasa, is one of the holiest cave retreats in Ü. Among the many ascetics who have sojourned here are Guru Rinpoche and Atisha (Jowo-je). King Songtsen Gampo also meditated in a cave, after his Tibetan wife established the first retreat. The peaceful site (4400m) offers lovely views and is easily combined with Ganden Monastery as a full-day trip.\nAt one time the hill at the base of the cave-dotted cliffs was home to Yerpa Drubde Monastery, the summer residence of Lhasa’s Gyutö College at the Ramoche Temple. The monastery was destroyed in 1959. Monks have begun to return to Yerpa but numbers are strictly controlled by the government, which carries out regular patriotic study sessions.From the car park, take the left branch of the stairway to visit the caves in clockwise fashion. The first caves are the Rigsum Gompo Cave and the Demdril Drubpuk, the cave where Atisha (shown in a red hat) meditated as part of his 12 years spent proselytising in Tibet. Look for the stone footprints of Yeshe Tsogyel in the former and the fifth Dalai Lama outside the latter. At one nearby cave pilgrims squeeze through a hole in the rock wall; at another they take a sip of holy water.The yellow Jamkhang has an impressive two-storey statue of Jampa flanked by Chana Dorje (Vajrapani) to the left and Namse (Vairocana) and Tamdrin (Hayagriva) to the right. Other statues are of Atisha (Jowo-je) flanked by the fifth Dalai Lama and Tsongkhapa. The upper cave is the Drubthub-puk, offering an upper view of the Jampa statue next to the quarters of the Dalai Lama. Continuing east along the ridge a detour leads up to a chörten that offers fine views of the valley.Climb to the Chögyal-puk, the Cave of Songtsen Gampo. The interior chapel has a central thousand-armed Chenresig (Avalokiteshvara) statue known as Chaktong Chentong. Pilgrims circle the central rock pillar continually. A small cave and statue of Songtsen Gampo are in the right-hand corner.The next chapel surrounds the Lhalung-puk, the cave where the monk Lhalung Pelde meditated after assassinating the anti-Buddhist king Langdharma in 842. A statue of the monk wearing his black hat occupies the back room. Look also for the photo of Drak Yerpa dating from 1937.The most atmospheric chapel is the Dawa-puk (Moon Cave), where Guru Rinpoche (the main statue) is said to have meditated for seven years. Look for the rock carvings of Drölma and Chenresig in the left corner of the ante-room and the stone footprints (one of his boot, one with his toes) of Guru Rinpoche in the inner room, to the right.Below the main caves and to the east is the yellow-walled Neten Lhakhang, where the practice of worshipping the 16 arhats was first introduced. Below here is where Atisha is said to have taught. A 15-minute walk takes you around the holy mountain of Yerpa Lhari, topped by prayer flags and encircled by a kora.There are several caves and retreats higher up the cliff-face and some fine hiking possibilities in the hills if you have time, including a half-day high kora. A pilgrim guesthouse by the car park offers simple food and accommodation.If you are here in September, specifically the 10th day of the seventh Tibetan lunar month, head here for the Yerpa tsechu festival, during which a large thangka is unveiled and cham dances are performed.The paved road from Lhasa crosses the prayer-flag-draped 3980m Ngachen-la before turning into the side valley at Yerpa village and passing two ruined dzong and a large disused dam en route to the caves, 10km from the main road. The paved side road to Drak Yerpa makes for a good uphill biking destination.A daily pilgrim bus leaves from Barkhor Sq but foreigners currently can't take it. Drivers often call the site ‘Drayab’."

        "detail_description": "Built by King Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century, Pabonka Monastery is one of the most ancient Buddhist sites in the Lhasa region. Though one of the lesser-visited monasteries in the area, it is only a short detour from Sera Monastery. Built on a flat-topped granite boulder said to resemble a tortoise, Pabonka's timeless chapels may even pre-date the Jokhang and Ramoche.\nKing Songtsen Gampo and his Chinese wife Princess Wencheng, as well as Tibetan king Trisong Detsen, Guru Rinpoche and Tibet’s first seven monks, all meditated here at various times. The original nine-storey tower was destroyed in 841 by the anti-Buddhist King Langdharma but rebuilt in the 11th century. The fifth Dalai Lama added an extra floor to that two-storey building. It suffered damage in the Cultural Revolution and has undergone repairs in recent years.Rigsum Gonpo TempleThis temple is the first you come across when visiting Pabonka Monastery. The most famous relic is the blue and gold carved stone mantra ‘Om mani padme hum’ (‘Hail to the jewel in the lotus’) that faces the entrance on the far side of the hall. It is said to have been carved by Tibetan minister Thonmi Sambhota, who created the Tibetan script here after a visit to India. The central shrine contains a 1300-year-old ‘self-arising’ stone carving depicting Chenresig, Jampelyang and Chana Dorje (Vajrapani) – the Rigsum Gonpo trinity after which the chapel is named. The stone carvings were buried during the Cultural Revolution and only dug up in 1985.Palden Lhamo CaveIt is said that King Songtsen Gampo once meditated in this cave. Images inside are of Songtsen Gampo (with a turban), his two wives, Guru Rinpoche, Trisong Detsen (in the corner) and a rangjung (self-arising) rock carving of the protectress Palden Lhamo.The cave is located just uphill from the Rigsum Gonpo Temple, on the west side of the Pabonka rock (said to represent a female tortoise).Pabonka PodrangThis temple atop the Pabonka rock is what remains of the original nine-storey palace. The upper floor has an intimate assembly hall with a ‘self-arising’ Chenresig statue hidden behind a pillar to the right. The inner protector chapel has a statue of red-faced local protector Gonpo Dashey Marpo (second from the right) next to an impressive stag's head. The four-pillared Kashima Lhakhang next door is lined with various lamas, ministers, three kings and their wives. The cosy rooftop quarters of the Dalai Lama have a statue of the meditational deity Demchok (Chakrasamvara). A legend claims that it was here that Songtsen Gampo first hatched the plan of building the Potala Palace on top of Marpo Ri, which is clearly visible from here.Gyasa PodrangThe yellow Gyasa Podrang (Princess Wencheng Temple) sits above the Pabonka Podrang and the remains of 108 chörtens at the top of Pabonka Monastery. The two ground-floor rooms are dedicated to different manifestations of the medicine buddhas and Tsongkhapa, and an upper-floor chapel has a small statue of Wencheng herself in the far right, near an image of Thonmi Sambhota.Songtsen Gampo’s Nepali wife Bhrikuti is also present, as are images of green and white Drölma, of whom the two wives are thought to be emanations. Also present is Gar Tongtsen, the Tibetan minister who travelled to the Tang Chinese court to escort Princess Wencheng back to Tibet.Just next to the Gyasa Podrang, and next to rows of photogenic white chortens, is a new lhakhang housing the funeral stupa of Tantric teacher Nakchang Rinpoche.Getting ThereTo get to Pabonka, take bus 20 from Beijing Donglu to the Sera Monastery turn-off on Nangre Beilu. A paved road branches left before the military hospital and leads all the way to Pabonka and Chupsang. You’ll soon see Pabonka up ahead to the left, perched on its granite boulder. The ‘monastery’ to the right is actually Chupsang Nunnery. A ride from the junction in a minivan costs ¥10 per person, or ¥30 for a taxi."

        "detail_description": "You start the tour of the main Potala building from the top and descend through the bowels of the building to exit on the ground floor. The gilded buddhas, intricate mandalas and towering funeral stupas you pass en route rank as the highlights of the Potala.\nThird FloorOn the 3rd floor, the first room is the Chapel of Jampa (Jamkhang), which contains an exquisite image of Jampa (Maitreya, or the Future Buddha) commissioned by the eighth Dalai Lama; it stands opposite the eighth Dalai Lama’s throne. To the left of the Jampa statue, in the corner, is a wooden Kalachakra mandala. The walls are stacked with the collected works of Tsongkhapa (founder of the Gelugpa order) and the fifth Dalai Lama. The chapel was damaged in a fire (caused by an electrical fault) in 1984 and many valuable thangkas (religious paintings) were lost.Next, the Chapel of Three-Dimensional Mandalas (Loilang Khang) houses spectacular jewel-encrusted 18th-century mandalas of the three principal yidam (Tantric deities) of the Gelugpa order. These are essentially three-dimensional versions of the mandalas you see painted on thangkas everywhere in Tibet and act as meditation maps for the mind.The Chapel of the Victory over the Three Worlds (Sasum Namgyal) houses a library and displays of Manchu texts. The main statue in the corner is a golden thousand-armed Chenresig, while the main central thangka is of the Manchu Chinese emperor Qianlong dressed in monk’s robes, with accompanying inscriptions in Tibetan, Chinese, Mongolian and Manchurian.Next, the Chapel of Immortal Happiness (Chimey Dedan Kyil) was once the residence of the sixth Dalai Lama, Tsangyang Gyatso, whose throne remains; it is now dedicated to Tsepame, the Buddha of Longevity, who sits by the window.In the northwestern corner is the Lama Lhakhang and the golden tomb of the Seventh Dalai Lama (Serdung Tashi Obar Khang), constructed in 1757 and encased in half a tonne of gold. To the right stands a half-hidden statue of Kalsang Gyatso, the seventh Dalai Lama.Also in the northwestern corner, steps lead up into the small but important Chapel of Arya Lokeshvara (Phagpa Lhakhang). It is said that this is one of the few corners of the Potala that dates from the time of Songtsen Gampo’s 7th-century palace. It is the most sacred of the Potala’s chapels, and the sandalwood image of Arya Lokeshvara inside is the most revered image housed in the Potala. The statue is accompanied on the left by the seventh Dalai Lama and Tsongkhapa, and on the right by the fifth, eighth and ninth Dalai Lamas. Relics include stone footprints of Guru Rinpoche and Tsongkhapa.The towering, jewel-encrusted tomb of the Eighth Dalai Lama dates from 1805 and is more than 9m tall. Pilgrims are blessed here with the hat of the eighth Dalai Lama. The equally impressive tomb of the Ninth Dalai Lama was under renovation in 2018.Second FloorThe first of the chapels you come to on the 2nd floor is the Chapel of Kalachakra (Dukhor Lhakhang), also known as the Wheel of Time. It is noted for its stunning three-dimensional mandala, which is more than 6m in diameter and finely detailed with more than 170 statues.In the Chapel of the Nine Buddhas of Longevity (Tsepak Lhakhang), look for the murals by the left-hand window if you can get a monk to lift the cloth – the left-hand side depicts Thangtong Gyalpo and his celebrated bridge (now destroyed) over the Yarlung Tsangpo near Chushul. The images of coracle rafts halfway up the wall add an intimate touch. Murals by the right-hand window depict the construction of the Potala. There are also nine statues of Tsepame here, as well as green and white Drölma (Tara, a female bodhisattva).Passing the closed Chapel of Sakyamuni (Zegya Lhakhang), continue to the northwestern corner, where you’ll find a small corridor that leads to King Songtsen Gampo’s Meditation Chamber (Chogyal Drupuk), which, along with the Chapel of Arya Lokeshvara on the 3rd floor, is one of the oldest rooms in the Potala. The most important statue is of Songtsen Gampo himself, to the left of the pillar. To the left is his minister Tonmi Sambhota (said to have invented the Tibetan script) and to the right are his Chinese and Nepali wives. A statue of the king’s Tibetan wife, Mongsa Tricham (the only one to bear a son), is in a cabinet by the door. The fifth Dalai Lama lurks behind (and also on) the central pillar. Also here is Gar Tsongtsen, the Tibetan prime minister (and Songtsen Gampo's right-hand man), who travelled to the Tang court to escort Princess Wencheng back to Lhasa. Queues for this chapel can be long.The last three rooms are all linked and are chock-a-block full of 3000 pieces of priceless statuary, many donated by a Khampa businessman in 1995.The 1st floor has been closed to visitors for years and is unlikely to reopen soon.Ground FloorAs you round the steps on the ground floor, enter the beautiful assembly hall, the largest hall in the Potala and its physical centre. Note the fine carved pillar heads. The large throne that dominates the far end of the hall was the throne of the sixth Dalai Lama. Four important chapels frame the hall.The first chapel on this floor is the Chapel of Lamrim. Lamrim means ‘the graduated path’ and refers to the stages that mark the path to enlightenment. The central figure in the chapel is Tsongkhapa, with whom lamrim texts are usually associated. Outside the chapel, to the left, a fine mural depicts the Forbidden City, commemorating the fifth Dalai Lama’s visit to the court of Emperor Shunzhi in 1652. Murals depict the tent camps used by the court on its journey across Tibet.The next chapel, the long Rigzin Lhakhang, is dedicated to eight Indian teachers who brought various Tantric practices and rituals to Tibet. The central figure is a silver statue of Guru Rinpoche (one of the eight), who is flanked by his consorts Mandarava and Yeshe Tsogyel (with a turquoise headdress), as well as statues of the eight teachers to the left and further statues on the right of the guru in the eight manifestations known as the Guru Tsengye.In the west wing of the assembly hall is one of the highlights of the Potala, the awe-inspiring Chapel of the Dalai Lamas’ Tombs (Serdung Zamling Gyenjikhang). The hall is dominated by the huge 12.6m-high chörten of the great fifth Dalai Lama, gilded with some 3.7 tonnes of gold. Flanking it are two smaller chörtens containing the 10th and 12th Dalai Lamas, who both died as children. Richly embossed, the chörtens represent the concentrated wealth of an entire nation. One of the precious stones is a pearl said to have been discovered in an elephant’s brain and thus, in a wonderful piece of understatement, ‘considered a rarity’. Eight other chörtens represent the eight major events in the life of the Buddha.The last chapel is the Chapel of the Holy Born (Trungrab Lhakhang). First, in the corner, is the statue and chörten of the 11th Dalai Lama, who died at the age of 17. There are also statues of the eight medicine buddhas with their characteristic blue hair, a central golden Sakyamuni and the fifth Dalai Lama (silver), and then Chenresig, Songtsen Gampo, Dromtönpa (founder of the Kadampa order) and the first four Dalai Lamas."

To the rear of the hall are four chapels. To the left is a dark chapel dedicated to the dharma protector of the east, Ta-og (in an ornate brass case and wearing a hat), alongside a central Dorje Jigje. Look for the masks, antlers, iron thunderbolts and mirrors hanging from the ceiling. To the left of the entrance is a three-dimensional wooden mandala used to invoke the medicine buddha.Continue to the central chapel, which contains statues of the Past, Present and Future Buddhas, as well as 16 arhats (literally 'worthy ones') depicted in their mountain grottoes.The next chapel is home to Dagtse Jowo, a central Sakyamuni statue that dates from the 15th century and is the most sacred of the college’s statues. At the back are Tsepame and eight bodhisattvas; all are guarded by the protectors Tamdrin (Hayagriva; red) and Miyowa (Achala; blue). The last chapel is dedicated to Tsongkhapa, and there are also images of several Dalai Lamas, as well as of Sakya Yeshe (in the left corner with a black hat), Sera’s founder and first abbot.There are two chapels on the upper floor. The first, after you mount the stairs, is dedicated to Sakyamuni, depicted in an unusual standing form known as Thuwang. The second is a Drölma chapel with 1000 statues of this protective deity, as well as the Tsela Nam Sum longevity trinity. The third has 1000 statues of Chenresig, as well as a huge brass pot in the corner. All chapels sell amulets and blessed rilbu (herbal medicinal pills)Exit at the back of the compound and jog around a minor debating courtyard to reach the Sera Ngagpa College."

        "detail_description": "This monastery, 10 minutes’ walk downhill from Drepung Monastery, is worth a visit for its historical role as the seat of the Tibetan State Oracle until 1959.\nThe Nechung oracle was the medium of Dorje Drakden, an aspect of Pehar, the Gelugpa protector of the Buddhist state, and the Dalai Lamas would make no important decision without first consulting him. The oracle was not infallible, however; in 1904 the oracle resigned in disgrace after failing to predict the invasion of the British under Younghusband. In 1959 the State Oracle fled to India with the Dalai Lama.Nechung is an eerie place associated with possession, exorcism and other pre-Buddhist rites. The blood-red doors at the entrance are painted with flayed human skins, and scenes of torture line the top of the outer courtyard. Tantric drumming booms from the depths of the building like a demonic heartbeat.For images of Dorje Drakden, the protective spirit manifested in the State Oracle, see the back-room chapel to the left of the main hall. The statue in the left corner shows Dorje Drakden in his wrathful aspect, so terrible that his face must be covered; the version on the right has him in a slightly more conciliatory frame of mind. The la-shing (sacred tree) in between the two is the home of Pehar.The far-right chapel has an amazing spirit trap (a collection of coloured threads used to trap evil spirits), some fine painted cabinets and a statue of the Dzogchen deity Ekajati, recognisable by her single fang and eye and representing the power of concentration. On the 1st floor is an audience chamber, whose throne was used by the Dalai Lamas when they consulted with the State Oracle. The 2nd floor features a huge new statue of a wrathful Guru Rinpoche. Don’t miss the fine murals in the exterior courtyard (photos are allowed).Nechung is easily reached on foot after visiting Drepung, on the way to the main road. A path leads past mani stone-carvers to the monastery (10 minutes). En route look for the metal icon moulds that are dipped in streams to act like underwater prayer flags, releasing fleeting fluid icons."

        "detail_description": "This significant but small monastery is jam-packed with ancient relics and hidden treasures. It’s only 30 minutes' drive southwest of Lhasa and is worth a stop en route to or from the airport for those interested in Tibetan Buddhism.\nDrölma Lhakhang is associated with the Bengali scholar Atisha (982–1054). Atisha came to Tibet at the age of 53 at the invitation of the king of the Guge kingdom in western Tibet and his teachings were instrumental in the so-called second diffusion of Buddhism in the 11th century. Drölma Lhakhang was established at this time by one of Atisha’s foremost disciples, Drömtonpa, who also founded the Kadampa order, to which the monastery belongs. It was here at Netang that Atisha died, aged 72.The 11th-century monastery was spared desecration by the Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution after a direct request from Bangladesh (which now encompasses Atisha’s homeland). Apparently, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai intervened on its behalf.The first chapel to the left is a gönkhang (protector chapel), decorated with severed stags’ heads and arrow holders. As you enter and exit the main monastery building, look for the two ancient guardian deities, which may even date back to the 11th-century founding of the monastery. An inner kora (pilgrim circuit) surrounds the main chapels.From the entry, pass into the first chapel, the renovated Namgyel Lhakhang, which contains a number of chörtens (Buddhist stupas). The black-metal Kadampa-style chörten to the right reputedly holds the staff of Atisha and the skull of Naropa, Atisha’s teacher. Statuary includes Atisha and the eight medicine buddhas.The eponymous middle Drölma Lhakhang houses a number of relics associated with Atisha. The statues include an 11th-century statue of Jowo Sakyamuni and at the top, behind a grill, are statues of the 13th Dalai Lama, Green Tara, and Serlingpa (right, with a red hat), another teacher of Atisha. The lower statue to the right behind the grill is an image of Jampa that was reputedly saved from Mongol destruction when it shouted ‘Ouch!’. There are also 21 statues of Drölma.The final Tsepame Lhakhang has original statues of Tsepame, cast with the ashes of Atisha, flanked by Marmedze (Dipamkara), the Past Buddha, Jampa (the Future Buddha) and the eight bodhisattvas. The small central statue of Atisha in a glass case is backed by his original clay throne. As you leave the chapel, look out for the great old leather prayer wheel and two sunken white chörtens, which respectively hold the robes of Atisha and his main disciple Dromtonpa. Upstairs are the throne room and, at the far end, the living room of the Dalai Lamas, and to the right is a library.Just down a side road opposite the monastery is the Kumbum Lhakhang, whose two white chörtens enshrine the ashes of Atisha and Lama Dampa Sonam Gyeltsen, a teacher of Gelugpa founder Tsongkhapa.Drölma Lhakhang is 16km southwest of Lhasa on the old road to Shigatse, but it's bypassed by the main airport expressway that connects the capital to the Yarlung Tsangpo Valley. En route you’ll pass a blue rock carving of Sakyamuni at the base of a cliff about 11km southwest of Lhasa, or 6km north of Drölma Lhakhang (it’s easily missed coming from the south). Nyetang village and the monastery are between kilometre markers 4662 and 4663."

You can only enter the walled complex from its eastern side.\nThe first of the rooms is the Dalai Lama’s audience chamber. Note the wall murals, which depict the history of Tibet in 301 scenes that flow in rows from left to right. As you stand with your back to the window, the murals start on the left wall with Sakyamuni and show the mythical beginnings of the Tibetan people (from the union of a bodhisattva and a monkey in the Sheldrak Cave), as well as the first field in Tibet (representing the introduction of agriculture). The wall in front of you depicts the building of the circular monastery of Samye, as well as Ganden, Drepung and other monasteries to the right. The right wall depicts the construction of the Potala and Norbulingka.Next come the Dalai Lama’s private quarters, which consist of a meditation chamber and a bedroom. The rooms have been maintained almost exactly as they were when the Dalai Lama left them, and apart from the usual Buddhist images they contain the occasional surprise (a Soviet radio, among other things).The assembly hall, where the Dalai Lama would address heads of state, is home to an extraordinarily ornate gold throne backed by wonderful cartoon-style murals of the Dalai Lama’s court (left, at the back). Look out for British representative Hugh Richardson in a trilby hat, and several Mongolian ambassadors. The right wall depicts the Dalai Lamas. The first five lack the Wheel of Law, symbolising their lack of governmental authority. Last are the suites of the Dalai Lama’s mother (other sources state they are meeting rooms), whose bathroom sink overflows with offerings of one-máo notes."

The Lukhang is celebrated for its 2nd- and 3rd-floor murals, which date from the 18th century, but frustratingly these are currently not visible.\nThe lake was created during the construction of the Potala. Earth used for mortar was excavated from here, leaving a depression that was later filled with water. Lu (also known as naga) are subterranean dragon-like spirits that were thought to inhabit the area, and the Lukhang, or Chapel of the Dragon King, was built by the sixth Dalai Lama to appease them (and also to use as a retreat). You can see Luyi Gyalpo, the naga king, at the rear of the ground floor of the Lukhang. The naga spirits were finally interred in the nearby Palha Lu-puk.The 2nd-floor murals tell a story made famous by a Tibetan opera, while the murals on the 3rd floor depict different themes on each of the walls – Indian yogis demonstrating yogic poses (west), 84 mahisaddhas (masters of Buddhism; east), and the life cycle as perceived by Tibetan Buddhists (north), with the gods of Bardo, the Tibetan underworld, occupying its centre. Look for the wonderful attention to detail, down to the hairy legs of the sadhus and the patterns on the clothes.The 3rd floor contains a statue of an 11-headed Chenresig and a meditation room used by the Dalai Lamas. To see if the 3rd floor has reopened, walk clockwise around the outside of the building and enter from the back via a flight of stairs. Finish your visit with a kora (pilgrim circuit) of the island.For a detailed commentary on the murals, check out Ian Baker and Thomas Laird’s coffee-table book The Dalai Lama’s Secret Temple: Tantric Wall Paintings from Tibet."

The region is a favourite of birdwatchers.\nThe newly paved road leads right up to the village-like nunnery (4410m). The central assembly hall contains statues of Guru Rinpoche and several old lamas of the Nyingma and Dzogchen schools. Stairs to the right lead upstairs to a chapel with a statue of Machik Labdronma (holding a double drum), the famous 11th-century adept who opened up the valley and who is considered an emanation of Yeshe Tsogyel (the consort of Guru Rinpoche). The assembly hall features a B&amp;W photo and wall mural of one of Labdronma's subsequent reincarnations.You can hike up the hill, following the electric poles, for about 45 minutes to the Gangri Tokar shrine (Drubkhang), where Longchenpa, an important 14th-century Dzogchen lama, once meditated. The chapel has a cave shrine and a sacred tree stump in front of a rock image of the Dzogchen deity Rahulla.From here, fit and acclimatised hikers can climb for a couple of hours up past meditation caves (marked by prayer flags) to the ridgeline behind. The views of the Kyi-chu Valley are fantastic from here and if the weather is clear you’ll get views of snowcapped 7191m Nojin Kangtsang and other Himalayan peaks to the south. From the ridgeline you can continue northwest across a boulder field for 15 minutes to a small hill (5160m) topped by a chörten that offers epic views northwards as far as Lhasa. Alternatively you can continue east along the ridge to summit the bowl’s main peak.The road to Shongse branches off the main expressway to Gongkar Airport at Tsena village and diverts 13km up a side valley, passing the picturesque cliffside Samanga Monastery and small Öshang Lhakhang en route."

The square has been a focus for violent political protest on several occasions, notably in 1998 (when a Dutch tourist was shot in the shoulder) and most recently in 2008. The square is now bordered by metal detectors, riot-squad vehicles, fire-extinguisher teams (to prevent self-immolations) and rooftop surveillance. Despite the stream of selfie-taking tourists, the atmosphere is one of occupation or siege.\nClose to the entrance to the Jokhang a constant stream of Tibetans follows the Barkhor circumambulation route in a clockwise direction. Look for the two pot-bellied stone sangkang (incense burners) in front of the Jokhang. There are four sangkang, marking the four extremities of the Barkhor Circuit; the other two are at the rear of the Jokhang.Behind the first two sangkang are two open enclosures. The northern stele atop a turtle is inscribed with the terms of the Sino-Tibetan treaty of 822. The dual-language inscription delimits the Chinese–Tibetan border and guarantees mutual respect of the borders of the two nations, an irony given the political situation over the last 60 years. The southern enclosure harbours an ancient willow tree, known as the hair of the Jowo – according to legend, it was planted by Songtsen Gampo’s Chinese wife, Princess Wencheng – and two stele, one of which was erected in 1793 to commemorate the victims of a smallpox epidemic. Over the centuries Tibetans have chiselled out chunks of this stele for its purported protective medicinal properties."

It was from here that the early Dalai Lamas exercised their political as well as religious control over central Tibet, and the second, third and fourth Dalai Lamas are all entombed here.\nTo reach the palace from the monastery's car park, pass the juniper stalls and follow the kora clockwise around the outside of the monastery until you reach the steps.The first hall on the left is the Sanga Tratsang, a renovated chapel housing statues of the protectors Namtöse (Vaishravana), Nagpo Chenpo (Mahakala), Dorje Jigje (Vajra Bhairavo), bull-headed Chögyel (Dharmaraja), Palden Lhamo (Shri Devi; on a horse) and Dorje Drakden (the Nechung oracle), all arranged around a central statue of the fifth Dalai Lama, with the Wheel of Law characteristically in his hand.Head up the stairs and then across the main courtyard, where performances of cham (a ritual dance) are traditionally performed during the Shötun festival. The upper floor of the main building has three chapels that make up the apartments of the early Dalai Lamas. The second of the three chapels is the Nyiwo Tsomchen, the Sunlight Audience Room, with wonderfully detailed murals depicting the life of Atisha and the throne of the fifth Dalai Lama, next to a thousand-armed statue of Chenresig. The third is a simple living room.From here descend and cross over to an assembly hall whose entrance was defaced by a Cultural Revolution–era political slogan as recently as 2015. Signs lead past a refreshment stand and an easily missed corner rock shrine to Drölma next to the exit to the north, said to have arisen naturally."
