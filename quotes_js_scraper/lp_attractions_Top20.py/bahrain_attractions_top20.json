As you wander the atmospheric excavations of residential, commercial, public, military and religious buildings, contemplate this: humans have continuously inhabited this site since 2300 BC.\nThis is where the most important Dilmun finds have been made in Bahrain, and it provides an outstanding example not only of the might of Dilmun, but also its successors during the Tylos and Islamic periods. The fort is supported by a stylish, modern visitor centre and an excellent museum, where you can pick up a free audioguide. When you're done wandering the ruins, be sure to enjoy the glorious sea views with a drink at the Museum Café."

But arguably one of the most popular spaces, certainly with resident expat women, is the excellent museum cafe. Spacious, chic and comfortable, it has a first-rate terrace looking across the bay to the stunning Bahrain National Theatre.

There's fine gypsum and woodcarving throughout.\nThis was the seat of Bahraini power from 1869 to 1932, and its importance is reflected in the four different sections: sheikh, family, guests and servants. These are well captioned in English and a good half-hour could be spent rambling up and down the various staircases admiring the delicate arches, intricate wooden doors, courtyards and palm-trunk ceilings.

Built at a cost of US$20 million, it is the most sumptuous mosque in the country.\nMarble was brought over from Italy to adorn the floor, glass from Austria was put into the windows and teak from India was carved locally to make the majestic 6m-high doors. Able to hold up to 7000 worshippers, Al Fatih has an air of majesty unmatched by other mosques in Bahrain and is the only one actively able to accommodate visitors. There are dedicated English- and Arabic-speaking guides on hand every day to give free guided tours. Simply turn up at the mosque office and request one. Those requiring tours in a different language or groups of 10 or more must phone ahead. Dress modestly."

They come to take pictures in its shade and enjoy the sunken walkway marked by 19 carved silhouettes of other famous trees around the globe that circumnavigates the Tree of Life, framing it from different perspectives.\nIt is still not clear what sustains the tree, though the underground water source it is tapped into is probably what once drew the inhabitants of the small village excavations have revealed to be buried close by. Once literally just a tree in the desert, today there is also an informative visitors shelter with toilets and a security guard around the clock.On special occasions, like the Bahrain International Music Festival, the site's open-air platform hosts cultural events. The tree is best appreciated after dusk, when it is hauntingly lit up to accentuate the mystique that draws people to it. Be careful though, driving away in the dark is tricky in a location where there is no street lighting.The tree is 40km south of Manama and signposted from the Musakar Hwy, becoming visible as soon as you go off-road. A 4WD is not required but take care not to drive into soft sand."

        "detail_description": "This 200-year-old Hindu temple is the oldest in the Gulf and a testimony to Bahrain's ancient Indian community. Situated down a narrow alley in the heart of Little India, a red gate opens up to a courtyard overlooked by a painted two-storey building with decorated Indian elephants marching beside colourful red, yellow and pink floral patterns. In the courtyard, modest shrines with huge images of Hindu deities sit in the open as worshippers pay their respects.\n"

They are linked in the middle by three full-size wind turbines, which harness the onshore winds as they pass through the twin structures. This has helped the WTC win several awards for renewable energy, and has made it one of Manama's most photographed modern landmarks.\nAt the time of writing, a viewing platform open to tourists was being planned."
