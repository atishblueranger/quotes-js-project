        "detail_description": "Constructed almost entirely between 1895 and 1905 on a small segment of the ancient capital city, the tiny settlement of Painam Nagar consists of a single street, lined with around 50 (now dilapidated) mansions built by wealthy Hindu merchants. The once-elegant town is busy fighting a losing battle with nature, and with every passing year the trees and vines drape themselves a little further over the decaying houses, creating a delightful ghost-town quality where the buildings appear to hang like exotic fruits from the trees.\nMany of the original merchant owners fled to India at the time of the Partition, leaving their elegant homes in the care of poor tenants, who did nothing to maintain them. Most of the remaining owners pulled out during the anti-Hindu riots of 1964, which led to the 1965 Indo–Pakistan War. Despite the rot, a few people continue to live in some of the houses and their bright shades add a technicolour tint to the village."

The fort is particularly atmospheric in the early morning light. Construction began in 1677 under the direction of Prince Mohammed Azam, Emperor Aurangzeb's third son, although he handed it to Shaista Khan for completion. However, the death of Khan’s daughter, Pari Bibi (Fair Lady), was considered such a bad omen that the fort was never completed.\nThree architectural monuments within the complex were finished: the Mausoleum of Pari Bibi (in front of you as you enter), the Diwan, or Hall of Audience (to your left) and the three-domed Quilla Mosque (to your right) all date from 1684.The only monument you can enter is the Diwan, an elegant two-storey structure containing a small but excellent museum of Mughal miniature paintings, coins, carpets and calligraphy, along with swords and firearms. In the same building, a massive arched doorway leads to the hammam (bathhouse). Outside is a huge disused bathing tank.The Mausoleum of Pari Bibi is unusual because of its materials of construction: black basalt, white marble and encaustic tiles of various colours have been used to decorate its interior, while the central chamber, where Pari Bibi is buried, is entirely veneered in white marble."

Shait Gumbad means ‘the Temple with 60 Domes’ – a misnomer considering there are actually 81. This fortress-like structure has unusually thick walls, built in the tapering brick style, and is a hugely impressive sight. The overall architectural influence is unmistakably Turkish, and the arches within the main hall are a graceful exercise in geometry.\nAdmission includes entrance to the museum, which is within the grounds of the mosque. Note that women travellers have been known to be refused entry into the main mosque (a sign at the entrance of the mosque says as much), although this isn’t always the case. Many of the domes as well as the entire western wall were under restoration at the time of research, which resulted in the structure being swathed in a dull pink shade of lime mortar."

Exploring it from the deck of a small boat from Sadarghat (shod-or-ghat) is to see Bangladesh at its grittiest. The panorama of river life is fascinating. Triple-towered ferries leer over pint-sized canoes, and country boats bump against overladen barges with barely an inch of clearance above water.\nOn the foreshores, stained with grease and mud, you’ll find children fishing with homemade nets in the lee of rusting tankers. Further out, repairmen busy themselves crashing, bashing and scrubbing ship hulls while floating on planks of wood.Among all the large ships are the tiny wooden ones that you can hire. These are available almost everywhere along the waterfront, though most people hire them from around Sadarghat boat terminal. If you just walk along the jetty here, English-speaking boatmen will find you and offer you a one-hour tour of the river. If you can barter the price down to Tk 30 you’ll be doing well.Alternatively, if you don’t fancy a price battle with the touts, walk slightly west to the small rowing-boat landing; from here wooden rowing boats ferry passengers across the river all day for a set price of Tk 5 per person. The opposite riverbank is of no particular interest – it’s packed with clothes shops and stalls, although there are some snack stalls and tea stands, too – but it’s the trip there and back that’s the attraction."

Lord Curzon stayed here whenever he was in town.\nAfter the death of the nawab (prince) and his son, the family fortune was dispersed and the palace eventually fell into disrepair. It was saved from oblivion by massive restoration in the late 1980s, aided by photos of each of the 23 rooms, taken during the high point of the palace’s history. The photos are still on display, as are various family portraits and the skull of Nawab Abdul Ghani’s favourite elephant, Feroz Jung."

The main audience chamber here has the remnants of a rotating dance floor.The Rajeswari temple and the stone temple, believed to be dedicated to Shiva, are just two of the finer shrines within the complex, while just outside are the former stables for the rajbari’s 99 elephants (now occupied by the local police).The rajbari is signposted from the main road where the bus stops."

Expect to pay around Tk 800 for a rowboat (three hours one way) or Tk 1600 for a motorboat (one hour one way). Note that boats can’t take you all the way to the China Clay Hills because the site isn’t beside the river.

Deforestation caused by a growing but poor population has meant that the area has lost 90% of its forest cover in the last four decades.Technically there’s an Interpretation Centre by the entrance and some basic accommodation, but both were shut when we visited."

        "detail_description": "This well-kept building and garden complex was the family home of revered 19th-century Bengali poet Michael Madhusudan Dutt (1824–73), who is known to have introduced blank verse to Bengali poetry and is credited with some of the most intricate verses ever written in the language. The main mansion where he was born and grew up before moving to Kolkata for higher studies is now a museum of family memorabilia. The surrounding gardens and orchards are particularly photogenic.\nTo get here, take a Satkhira-bound bus to Chuknagar (Tk 30, 40 minutes, 7am to 5pm) and then change for Keshabpur (Tk 20, 20 minutes, every hour). From Keshabpur, hire a 'van-rickshaw' (a battery-operated rickshaw with a seating board attached) to Sagordari for Tk 300. Alternatively, drive from Khulna in a hired car. The journey takes about an hour."

        "detail_description": "This ruined 170-sq-m monastery has 115 cells for monks, facing a temple in the centre of the courtyard. The royal copper plates of Deva kings and a terracotta seal bearing a royal inscription found here indicate that the monastery was built by Sri Bhava Deva in the first half of the 8th century. The entire basement wall was heavily embellished with decorative elements such as terracotta plaques and ornamental bricks.\nTo get here, take a shared auto from Kandirpar Circle to Kotbari (Tk 40), a small village just across the Dhaka–Chittagong Hwy and a couple of kilometres from the ruins. Then either walk or take another shared auto (Tk 10) the rest of the way. Your best bet for shared autos is the road leading south off Kandirpar Circle, as that’s the way they go to Kotbari. A private CNG will cost around Tk 150 each way."

        "detail_description": "The thin stretch of parkland on the waterfront at the western edge of town makes up one of the most enjoyable public spaces in this part of Bangladesh. Late every afternoon, locals take full advantage by decamping down here to loll about in the shade of trees and watch multicoloured boats crisscross the river. In the playing fields just behind the parkland, numerous cricket matches add their thunk and whack to proceedings.\nShould you want a closer look at the other side of the river, one of the small wooden boats will take you over (Tk 2). From the far bank, set off across this rural scene towards one of the many little villages, whose locals are likely to be very welcoming. It’s a perfect setting in which to create your own adventure."

When finished it will be full of handicrafts from the 17th century onwards. Currently, a new building nearby houses the collection, which is strong on carved wood, pottery, jewellery and even bed-sized treasure chests.Your ticket gives entry to both museums and the grounds, where the rajbari's beautiful water-soaked gardens are another highlight, and perfect picnic territory.\nSadarbari is a popular destination for visitors from Dhaka, and throngs at weekends. It takes about 30 minutes to walk here from where the bus drops you off. Rickshaws (Tk 10 to Tk 20) are also widely available."
