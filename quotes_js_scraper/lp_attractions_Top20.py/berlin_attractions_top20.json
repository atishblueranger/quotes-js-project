        "detail_description": "Berlin’s oldest public park has provided relief from urbanity since 1840, but has been hilly only since the late 1940s, when wartime debris was piled up here to create two 'mountains' – the taller one, Mont Klamott, rises 78m high. Diversions include expansive lawns for lazing, tennis courts, a half-pipe for skaters, a couple of handily placed beer gardens and an outdoor cinema.\nKids in tow? There are imaginatively themed playgrounds and the enchanting 1913 Märchenbrunnen fountain, where turtle and frog sculptures frolic in terraced water basins flanked by Cinderella, Snow White and other Brothers Grimm stars.If you have a soft spot for revolutionaries, visit the park’s communist-era memorial sites. Along Friedenstrasse, the Denkmal der Spanienkämpfer pays respect to the German members of the International Brigades who died in the Spanish Civil War (1936–39). Just off Landsberger Allee is the Friedhof der Märzgefallenen, a cemetery for the victims of the revolutionary riots of March 1848; an exhibit provides historical background. Finally, on the park's northern edge, the Denkmal des Polnischen Soldaten und des deutschen Antifaschisten honours the joint fight of Polish soldiers and the German resistance against the Nazis."

        "detail_description": "Charlottenburg Palace is one of Berlin's few sites that still reflect the one-time grandeur of the Hohenzollern clan, which ruled the region from 1415 to 1918. Originally a petite summer retreat, it grew into an exquisite baroque pile with opulent private apartments, richly decorated festival halls, collections of precious porcelain and paintings by French 18th-century masters. It's lovely in fine weather, when you can fold a stroll in the palace park into a day of peeking at royal treasures.\nThe palace's oldest section, the Altes Schloss, is an extravaganza in stucco, brocade and overall opulence. Highlights include: the Oak Gallery, a wood-panelled festival hall draped in family portraits; the lovely Oval Hall, with views of the gardens; Friedrich I’s bedchamber, with the first-ever bathroom in a baroque palace; and the fabulous Porcelain Chamber, smothered top to bottom in Chinese and Japanese blue ware.Charlottenburg's most beautiful rooms are the flamboyant private chambers of Frederick the Great in the Neuer Flügel extension, designed in 1746 by the period's star architect Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff. Standouts include the confection-like White Hall banquet room, the mirrored and gilded Golden Gallery and the paintings by Watteau, Pesne and other 18th-century French masters. In the same wing, the apartments of Queen Luise (1776–1810), wife of King Friedrich Wilhelm III, are decked out with lavish chandeliers, period furniture and hand-painted silk wall coverings.The adjacent Schinkel-designed Neuer Pavillon served as a summer retreat for Friedrich Wilhelm III and now houses paintings from the Romantic and Biedermeier periods.A stroll around the sprawling palace park, with its shady walkways, flower beds and manicured lawns, is a must; you’ll stumble upon the pint-size palace called Belvedere, now an elegant setting for porcelain masterpieces by the royal manufacturer KPM.Across the carp pond awaits the 1810 neoclassical Mausoleum, where various royals, including Kaiser Wilhelm I and his wife, are entombed in ornate marble sarcophagi.Each building charges separate admission; it’s best to invest in the 'charlottenburg+' day pass for access to everything. The place gets busy, so come early on weekends and in summer."

        "detail_description": "The East Side Gallery is the embodiment of Berlin’s grit and guts. It’s a symbol of hope, creativity and resilience – for Berliners, but also the rest of the world.\nIn 1989, the Berlin Wall, a grey and grisly divider of humanity, was finally torn down after 28 years. Today its longest surviving stretch forms the world’s largest permanent open-air art gallery, known as the East Side Gallery.\nThe nearly mile-long (1.3 km) section of wall, located along the Spree River and Mühlenstrasse, showcases more than 100 murals. Dozens of international artists have translated the Cold War-era’s global euphoria and optimism into a mix of political statements, psychedelic-induced musings and manifold artistic visions.\nThese days, graffiti tagging forms a good part of the artwork, though it's strictly frowned upon as great measures have been taken to preserve and even reproduce some of the Gallery’s most iconic paintings like Dmitri Vrubel’s so-called Fraternal Kiss and Thierry Noir’s cartoon faces.\nNowadays, you’ll often see the East Side Gallery covered in groups of shutterbugs – the city estimates over three million visitors come here annually – as well as ample, unsightly fences warding off vandalism. On its backside, carousers drink beer and play techno from boomboxes along the banks of the Spree, while, on the other side of the wall, Mühlenstrasse has turned into the kind of dry, characterless commercial development that makes the locals moan.\nBut, despite such a touristy backdrop, just ask your average Berliner – there will always be a kind of magic about the East Side Gallery. Driving past after a serious night of clubbing or a biking adventure through the city will provide a little burst of pride and excitement, like watching a film strip of history unfold. After all, this relic is proof of just how far Berlin has come.\n\n  \nPeople walk past the My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love artwork on the East Side Gallery in Berlin © LordRunar / Getty Images\n\nThe history of the East Side Gallery\nDuring the Cold War, the part of the wall where the East Side Gallery is now situated was a border crossing to East Germany accessible to West Germans only. Essentially, it was an interior wall acting as an extra barrier to stop fleeing East Germans before reaching the infamous \"death strip\" (a no man’s land between the East and West sides where guards shot on sight).\nFollowing the Peaceful Revolution in 1989, most of the Berlin Wall was soon dismantled – this is the longest remaining stretch. One year later, over 100 artists from 21 countries staged a now legendary painting session here on the eastern side of the Wall. The East Side Gallery was eventually declared a monument by local authorities.\nSome of the most famous murals have forever found their places on the pages of history and pop culture. For example, Birgit Kinder’s Test the Rest, showing a Trabi bursting through the Berlin Wall, Dmitri Vrubel’s My God, Help Me To Survive This Deadly Love (also known as Fraternal Kiss), depicting East German leader Erich Honecker and high-ranking Soviet politician Leonid Brezhnev locking lips, and East German artist Thomas Klingenstein’s Detour to the Japanese Sector, a vivid depiction of the Japanese landscape (Japan was one of the countries East German citizens were prohibited from traveling to).\nIn 2009, the gallery underwent a controversial restoration due to the wall’s decay from atmospheric conditions and tourist graffiti. Several murals were erased and, in many cases, artists were asked to take part in repainting.\n\n  \nBirgit Kinder’s Test the Rest, showing a car bursting through the wall © Tupungato / Shutterstock\n\nSome refused and even took legal action, saying that they had not received adequate revenue from the monument and arguing that the restoration had destroyed the authenticity of the works. Others, including Vrubel who recreated Fraternal Kiss, obliged, albeit with a heavy heart.\nToday, the East Side Gallery is a symbol of an older period of Berlin – the Cold War, but also the early years of German reunification when the city was as gritty and hard-boiled as ever. Opposite the wall, on the other side of Mühlenstrasse, lies a newer Berlin – high-rise condo buildings, a concert arena and, further beyond, a new shopping mall that’s often been described as an eyesore.\nThe East Side Gallery too remains an area of interest to investors. In 2013, part of the monument was scheduled to be destroyed to build deluxe apartments. Protests from Berliners – and even an appearance from David Hasselhoff himself – eventually led to the murals being moved across the street and preserved.\nPlan your visit\nThe East Side Gallery is located on Mühlenstrasse, a main thoroughfare straddling the Kreuzberg (former West), Mitte and Friedrichshain (former East) neighborhoods. It runs parallel to the Spree and lies between landmarks such as the pretty Oberbaumbrücke and Ostbahnhof train station, and is within walking distance of several nightclubs including Watergate and Club der Visionäre.\nThe Gallery is free and accessible 24 hours a day. You can stroll it in either direction. If you start at the end near the Oberbaumbrücke, you can visit the Wall Museum first for an overview of the history of the Berlin Wall. Crowd favorite Dimitri Vrubel's My God, Help Me to Survive This Deadly Love mural is also nearer this end of the Gallery.\nAs such, this area is quite busy at all times of day. However, you will likely get the best views and fewer crowds of the East Side Gallery earlier in the morning, so aim to make it your first stop. A path along the Spree river banks (the opposite side of the wall) is popular among morning joggers.\n\n  \nThe East Side Gallery is a hive of activity at most times of day © hanohiki / Shutterstock\n\nGetting there\nThe East Side Gallery can be accessed by public transit. It is most easily reached by the U-bahn line U1 to Warschauer Straße or Schlesisches Tor station, or S-bahn line S5, S7, or S9 to Warschauer Straße or Ostbahnhof station.\nDid you know?\nPainted sections of the Berlin Wall exist not only at the East Side Gallery but all over the world. These remnants have been delivered to several countries such as Iceland, South Korea and Estonia, among others, as symbolic gifts of freedom and solidarity.\nIn Brussels, a large section bearing the image of former US President John F. Kennedy is located in front of the European Commission headquarters. Another section can be found in the gardens of the United Nations in New York.\n"

Don't miss the Rembrandt Room (Room X).\nGerman, Dutch and Flemish masters dominate the east wing where highlights include the Fountain of Youth by Lucas Cranach the Elder in Room III and Pieter Bruegel the Elder's Dutch Proverbs in Room 7. The West Wing is dedicated to the Italians with such top canvasses as Caravaggio's Amor Victorius and Boticelli's Madonna with Child and Singing Angels. The excellent free audioguide has the low-down on these and other selected works. Note that the room numbering system is quite confusing as both Latin (I, II, III) and Arabic numbers (1, 2, 3) are used."

        "detail_description": "This Nazi-era bunker presents one of Berlin's finest private contemporary art collections, amassed by advertising guru Christian Boros who acquired the behemoth in 2003. A third selection of works went live in May 2017 and includes installations by Katja Novitskova, digital paintings by Avery Singer and photo series by Peter Piller. Book online (weeks, if not months, ahead) to join a guided tour (also in English) and to pick up fascinating nuggets about the building's surprising other peacetime incarnations.\nTours begin with an introduction to the exhibit and the building against the noisy backdrop of a clattering blackboard by Belgian artist Kris Martin called Mandi III. Leading the group past preserved original fittings, pipes, steel doors and vents, guides provide enough thought fodder, context and explanations about the artworks to help even the uninitiated tame their bewilderment.Built for 2000 people, the bunker's dank rooms crammed in twice as many during the heaviest air raids towards the end of WWII. After the shooting stopped, the Soviets briefly used it as a POW prison before it assumed a more benign role as a fruit and vegetable storeroom in East Berlin, a phase that spawned the nickname 'Banana Bunker'. In the 1990s, the claustrophobic warren hosted some of Berlin's naughtiest techno raves and fetish parties."

Built between 1952 and 1960, the 90m-wide boulevard runs for 2.3km between Alexanderplatz and Frankfurter Tor and is a fabulous showcase of East German architecture. A considerable source of national pride back then, it provided modern flats for comrades and served as a backdrop for military parades.\nSome of the finest East German architects of the day (Hartmann, Henselmann, Hopp, Leucht, Paulick and Souradny) collaborated on KMA's construction, looking to Moscow for inspiration. There, Stalin favoured a style that was essentially a socialist reinterpretation of good old-fashioned neoclassicism. In East Berlin, Prussian building master Karl Friedrich Schinkel was the stylistic godfather, rather than Walter Gropius and the boxy modernist aesthetic embraced in the West.Living here was considered a privilege; in fact, for a long time there was no better standard of living in East Germany. Flats featured such luxuries as central heating, lifts, tiled baths and built-in kitchens; facades were swathed in Meissen tiles."

        "detail_description": "A former Prussian officers' casino now showcases the artistic legacy of Helmut Newton (1920–2004), the Berlin-born enfant terrible of fashion and lifestyle photography, with the two lower floors dedicated to his life and work. On the top floor, the gloriously restored barrel-vaulted Kaisersaal (Emperor’s Hall) forms a grand backdrop for changing international photography exhibits.\nShortly before his fatal car crash, Newton donated 1500 images along with personal effects to the city in which he was born. He had studied photography here with famed fashion photographer Yva before fleeing Nazi Germany in 1938. His work reflects a lifelong obsession with the female body, which he often portrayed in controversial, quasi-pornographic poses. The ground-floor exhibit, entitled 'Helmut Newton's Private Property', provides a personal look at the man. On view are his partially recreated Monte Carlo office, his first camera (an Agfa Box he bought aged 12) and his customised Jeep (dubbed the Newton-Mobile). The galleries on the 1st floor showcase changing exhibitions of Newton's work, as well as that of his wife Alice Springs and other contemporaries such as James Nachtwey and David LaChapelle."
