Choose a quiet time of day, and duck into side streets where you can peek into lived-in residences with wooden staircases and cracked Victorian floor tiles.\nThe island (it's not really; the narrow channel to the north was dug by the British to detach it from the city) was acquired as a foreign concession in 1859 after the second Opium War. At its peak, Shamian was home to consulates, banks and trading firms from all over the globe. Today several of these heritage buildings house hotels, cafes and eateries."

The result is a photogenic collection of courtyards, pavilions, terraces, halls and water features. It's a 20-minute walk from the metro station to Yuyin Mountain Villa. A taxi from central Guangzhou should cost about ¥80 to ¥100.\nHighlights include the Waterside Pavilion, which commands a different vista on each of its eight sides, and the Deep Willow Room with its 'Manchu' windows (满洲窗, mǎnzhoū chuāng) of coloured glass, designed to create the illusion of the passing seasons by altering the hue of the garden scenery.A dessert shop on the premises is famous for ginger milk curd (姜汁撞奶, jiāngzhī zhuàngnăi; ¥10), a pudding-type treat made by adding the squeezed juice of fresh ginger to heated buffalo's milk."

        "detail_description": "Whether or not this actually is the grave of Abu Waqas, the man who brought Islam to China in the 7th century and an uncle of the Prophet Mohammed, the sense of reverence and tranquillity here makes it worth seeking out. To find the tomb, go past the main prayer hall to a pavilion. There you'll find a path strewn with tinsel and incense leading to the grave, draped in cloth.\nFrom Yuexiu Park metro exit B2, go north and take a left on Lanpu Lu. The entrance to the complex is at the end of the road."

His father Li Haiquan (李海泉) was a Cantonese opera practitioner and union member at Luányú Táng on the next alley north.\nYou can enter the old house, which has been stripped back to the bare bricks and is now an exhibition space displaying historic photographs of the surrounding neighbourhood."
