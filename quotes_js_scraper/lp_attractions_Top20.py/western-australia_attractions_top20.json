        "detail_description": "The 400-hectare, bush-filled expanse of Kings Park, smack in the city centre and enjoying epic views, is Perth's pride and joy. The Botanic Garden contains over 3000 plant species indigenous to WA, including a giant boab tree that's 750 years old. Each September there's a free festival displaying the state's famed wildflowers. A year-round highlight is the Federation Walkway, a 620m path leading to a 222m-long glass-and-steel sky bridge that crosses a canopy of eucalyptus trees.\nThe main road leading into the park, Fraser Ave, is lined with towering lemon-scented gums that are dramatically lit at night. At its culmination are the State War Memorial, a cafe, a gift shop, Fraser's restaurant and the Kings Park Visitor Centre. Free guided walks leave from here.It's a good spot for a picnic or to let the kids off the leash in one of the playgrounds. Its numerous tracks are popular with walkers and joggers all year round, with an ascent of the steep stairs from the river rewarded with wonderful views from the top."

Yes, the saltwater here is pink, due to the presence of the algae Dunaliella salina. The algae is a source of beta-carotene, which is harvested here and used in food coloring and make-up.\nHow can I visit?\nYou can access the Pink Lake for free by car&nbsp;from George Grey Dr (the road south of Kalbarri), but it pays to take the turn-off to Port Gregory for the best viewpoints. The Coral Coast is renowned for its incredible scenic beauty, but this photo opportunity&nbsp;is a tough view to beat. You can also take popular sightseeing flights over the lake from Kalbarri and Geraldton.\nCan I swim in the Pink Lake?\nThough it is safe to go into the water, caution is advisable. The salt crystals on the bottom of the lake can be very sharp and could easily cut your bare feet. It is also imperative to take any rubbish or belongings with you when you leave to preserve the beauty of the area. The water levels in the lake drop during summer; it's advisable to visit outside of this time if you want to photograph Hutt Lagoon in all its glory.\n"

It's not gargantuan – just 49ft (15m) high and 360ft (110m) long – but it's nonetheless impressive. And when the wind is whispering in the sheoaks, it's a quietly moving place – as it has always been for the Nyaki-Nyaki people.\nBest trails at Wave Rock\nTo get the most out of Wave Rock, pick up the Walk Trails at Wave Rock and The Humps brochure from the visitor centre. A steep walk leads up around the summit of Hyden Rock, passing a dazzlingly insensitive concrete-block wall built along the crest of Wave Rock to stop stone-surfers from plunging to their deaths (you can't see the wall from the base of the rock). There's another good trail to Hippo's Yawn along a shady half-mile-long&nbsp;track from the base of Wave Rock.\nTickets and information\nParking at Wave Rock is $12 per car (pay at the parking meter); or you can save a few bucks by parking out on Wave Rock Rd or the visitor centre and walking in a few hundred metres – pay pedestrian fees at the caravan-park kiosk.\n"

The Kalari Trail (1.6km loop) climbs onto a huge granite dome (one of the Humps) with excellent views, somehow wilder and more impressive than Wave Rock; while the Gnamma Trail (1.2km loop) stays low and investigates natural waterholes with interpretive panels on Nyaki-Nyaki culture."

The one-way Pinnacles Desert Dr loop road runs through the formations, but it's more fun on foot, especially in the crepuscular evening light when crowds evaporate.\nThe park's slinky black interpretation centre delivers the low-down on the Pinnacles, and sheds some light on the rest of the park's ecology: huge sand blows, banks of low scrub and wandering emus. Nearby Kangaroo Point and Hangover Bay are good for a post-Pinnacles picnic, with barbecues and tables; Hangover has the better swimming (a good hangover cure)."

The densest concentrations of rock art are around 50m south of the car park, and deeper into the gorge, where the ground is covered with scattered cockle shells.The park is co-managed by the local Ngarluma, Yindjibarndi, Yaburara and Mardudhunera communities and DPaW.You'll need a 4WD to explore north of Withnell Bay."

        "detail_description": "This hidden valley in Pickering Brook has sustained apple orchards since 1939. Take a one-hour tour through the trees on a tractor-pulled carriage, a 45-minute walking tour, or book a table at the excellent bistro (mains $27 to $32) or casual cider garden (mains $12 to $25) for lunch. But of course, the main deal here is cider: its 'Core Range' (ha-ha) includes outstanding sparkling apple and pear offings. Head to the Harvest Room for tastings (from $10).\nCore is big on weddings and events: it's probably worth a call in advance if you're making a special trip, to ensure they won't be closed for somebody's big betrothal."

Camp under the stars and watch the sun rise and set over Anthony Gormley's haunting work that consists of 51 sculptures, all derived from laser scans of Menzies' inhabitants and scattered across the vast expanse of the Lake Ballard salt flat.\n"

It's all revealed on a funny and informative 60-minute guided tour.\nThe park also has a range of diving opportunities (including diving with the park's sharks), plus 4WD and boat tours. It also has an excellent restaurant."
