        "detail_description": "Mattancherry Palace was a generous gift presented to the Raja of Kochi, Veera Kerala Varma (1537–65), as a gesture of goodwill by the Portuguese in 1555. The Dutch renovated it in 1663, hence the alternative name, the Dutch Palace. The building combines European and Keralan styles, but the star attractions are the royal bedchamber's astonishingly preserved Hindu murals from the 17th to 19th centuries, which depict scenes from the Ramayana, Mahabharata and Puranic legends in intricate, colourful detail.\nThere are more fine murals further into the palace, too, including Vishnu sleeping on a snake. A small Mahavishnu temple sits within the palace grounds."

It features an ornate brass bimah, elegant wooden benches, and elaborate hand-painted, willow-pattern floor tiles from Canton, China, added in 1762 during major remodelling under Ezekial Rahabi. It’s magnificently illuminated by Belgian chandeliers and coloured-glass lamps. The graceful clock tower dates from 1760, with inscriptions in Malayalam, Hebrew, Roman and Arabic script.\nThere's an upstairs balcony for women, who worshipped separately according to Orthodox rites. The majority of Kochi's Pardesi Jews have emigrated, but the synagogue remains excellently preserved. No photography."

Jeeps are arranged at either of the sanctuary's two entrances, Tholpetty and Muthanga; during the November-to-March high season, arrive at least an hour before the morning or afternoon openings to register and secure a vehicle.\nWhether you go to Tholpetty or Muthanga essentially depends on whether you're staying in the north or south of Wayanad, as there's no difference in the chances of spotting wildlife or the visiting arrangements. Both Tholpetty and Muthanga close from mid-March to mid-April, but remain open during the monsoon. There are a limited number of guides and jeeps permitted in the park at one time, and trekking is not permitted."

Smaller fishing nets are dotted around the shores of Vembanad and Ashtamudi lakes; some of the best are just east of Cherai Beach on Vypeen Island."

The ashram runs official tours at 5pm daily (check details online or download the Amma app). Many travellers stay overnight or longer term.\nIt’s a huge complex, with about 3500 people living here permanently – monks, nuns, students and families, both Indian and foreign. It offers food, ayurvedic treatments, and a daily schedule of yoga, meditation and darshan. Amma herself travels for much of the year (her schedule is online); a busy time of year at the ashram is around Amma's birthday on 27 September.Visitors should dress conservatively and there is a strict code of behaviour. With prior arrangement – register online – you can stay at the ashram in a triple room for ₹250 per person or a single for ₹500 (including simple vegetarian meals).Since the ashram is on the main canal between Kollam and Alleppey, many travellers break the popular ferry ride by getting off here, staying a day or two, then picking up another cruise. Alternatively, cross the canal via pedestrian bridge to Vallickavu and grab a rickshaw 10km south to Karunagappally or 12km north to Kayamkulam (around ₹200), from where you can catch onward buses or trains.If you aren't taking the cruise, take a train to Karunagappally or Kayamkulam, then an autorickshaw to Vallickavu and the bridge."

        "detail_description": "Trivandrum’s spiritual heart is this 18th-century temple (closed to non-Hindus) in the Fort area, which fuses Keralan and Dravidian architecture and whose origins go back to at least the 8th century. The main entrance is through the 30m-tall, seven-tier eastern gopuram (gateway tower), in Tamil Nadu style. In the inner sanctum, Padmanabha (a manifestation of Vishnu) reclines on the sacred serpent and is made from over 10,000 saligrams (sacred stones) purportedly transported from Nepal by elephant.\nA treasure stash with an estimated value of US$1 trillion was unearthed in a series of previously locked vaults beneath the temple in 2011, making it India's richest temple. The path around to the right of the eastern gate offers good views of the gopuram."
