As well as providing fantastic views of the eastern Himalaya, the park is home to extensive rhododendron forests, a gorgeous site when blooming in late April and May. The most used park entry point is near Tumling, on the road from Mane Bhanjang, 25km from Darjeeling, to Sandakphu.\nA local guide (per day per Indian/foreign group ₹1000/1300) or porter (per day ₹1000) is obligatory within the park (unless you come with a Forest Department–authorised guide from Darjeeling) and can be arranged at the Highlander Guides &amp; Porters Welfare Association in Mane Bhanjang. Bring your passport as you’ll have to register at a Frontier Check Post in Mane Bhanjang and probably show it elsewhere too. Jeep transport within the national park is available from the Singalila Land Rover Owner’s Welfare Association in Mane Bhanjang."

It has had Unesco World Heritage listing since 1999. Two-hour 'joy rides' from Darjeeling to Ghum and back satisfy most people's toy-train urges. There are normally around six of these pulled by antique steam locomotives daily, and three or so with diesel engines.\nJust one (diesel-powered) train in each direction daily makes the whole 88km (seven-hour!) trip between New Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling; another runs just from Kurseong to Darjeeling and back."

Walk-in visits to the processing factory, with huge sorting and drying machines, typically last 30 to 45 minutes (mornings before 9am are the best time to see the production process). For a more in-depth experience, reserve a day ahead through Makaibari Homestays for a day tour, which includes a factory visit, a plantation walk with tea plucking, lunch in a local homestay, and tea tasting.\nThe estate is 3km southwest of Kurseong station down Pankhabari Rd, and 1km past Cochrane Place. It's a pleasantish walk down (traffic can be irritating) and an uphill walk back. En route, the partly overgrown St Andrew's Cemetery has poignant reminders of the colonial tea-planter era. Local vans will take you either way for ₹20 (shared) or ₹200 'reserved' (all to yourself/ves). In town, they start from St Andrew's Church, 250m down Pankhabari Rd from the station.A shop at the factory gate sells Makaibari's prized teas (Silver Tips Imperial, the finest, costs ₹3500 per 100g!). Makaibari runs a homestay and volunteer programme from a separate office 150m down the road. Volunteers can find placements in teaching, health and community projects in March, April, May, October and November. A minimum two-week commitment is requested. Ask for Nayan Lama (if he's not in the office, ask at the factory-gate shop).Another possibility here is early-morning birdwatching tours (₹500 for one or two people, plus ₹200 for each extra person). More than half the Makaibari estate is forested and there's a sizeable population of hornbills, among other birds (and some rarely spotted leopards)."

A 300m path up to the summit starts about 100m along the eastern Mall road from Chowrasta.\nThe several other temples around the hilltop include a narrow cave with a Shiva lingam, signposted down steps to the left as you approach the summit. Sadly no mountain panoramas from the top, but if you go back down to the Mall and turn left (north) you'll soon reach a couple of viewpoints with Khangchendzonga-view benches.Observatory Hill was the original location of Bhutia Busty Gompa, whose monks may have given Darjeeling its name calling their site dorje-ling (place of thunder)."

This daily morning spectacle (views are best in autumn and spring) is a major tourist attraction, however, so if you prefer your Himalayan views in peace you might want to try somewhere else.\nHundreds of jeeps leave Darjeeling for Tiger Hill every morning at 4am – traffic snarls en route are quite common. Sunrise trips (usually with stops at Batasia Loop and a Buddhist monastery in Ghum on the way back) can be booked through a travel agency or directly with jeep drivers at the Clubside taxi stand. Return trips cost ₹1200 for a three/four passenger car, ₹1800 for a bigger, comfier Innova, or ₹200 per seat."

Toy-train joy rides stop here as a matter of course. Many road trips to Tiger Hill also stop here on the way back to Darjeeling.\n"
