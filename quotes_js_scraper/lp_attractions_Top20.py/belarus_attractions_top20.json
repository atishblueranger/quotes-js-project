A recent renovation has the place looking simply lovely, with gorgeous grounds and impressively restored interiors that have been converted into a museum with beautifully done displays on the life and times of the Radziwills. Definitely splash out for the audioguide, which offers fascinating descriptions of more than 120 items.\nThe interiors of some rooms have been recreated, and though it's clear that these were not the Romanovs, there's plenty of period furniture, armour and hunting trophies to gawk at. Photos and English-language placards bring Mir's turbulent history to life, and there are some displays on the town's interesting Jewish history.The place is busy at weekends, when rousing classical music is pumped into the castle's courtyard to stir your patriotism. It's quiet during the week."

He couldn't have picked a more beautiful spot, high above the Sozh River in the middle of what today is Belarus' prettiest park. The palace is now a museum containing 19th- and 20th-century antiques and paintings.\nSadly the palace's original art and furnishings did not survive the Soviet period, and most of what's here was imported more recently. Still, the collection fits nicely with the classical Russian interior, and the palace is well worth visiting. Rumyantsev did not live to see the completion of his masterpiece. His son took it over, and it was later sold to another famous field marshal of the times, Ivan Paskevich, who finished the palace and built the surrounding park.The palace's White Parlour has been converted into a theatre that hosts classical music concerts from September to May."

The hunting trophies room is well worth the price of entry alone.When you arrive you can buy your ticket at the information centre by the entrance to the causeway, or cross the causeway and purchase your ticket at the castle proper.The complex is full of street food vendors, so you can easily gather supplies for a picnic in the expansive park surrounding the castle. The park is perfect for cycling; rent bikes outside the castle entrance for BYN3 per hour.Email way ahead if you want an English-speaking tour guide for the 1½-hour excursions that are operated out of the information centre."

        "detail_description": "Unesco World Heritage Site Belavezhskaya Pushcha National Park is the oldest wildlife refuge in Europe and the pride of Belarus. At the National Park headquarters in Kamyanyuki, 55km north of Brest, you can arrange to tour the park by bus, bicycle or private car, and you can spend the night at one of several comfortable hotels near the park entrance.\nSome 1300 sq km of primeval forest survives in Belavezhskaya Pushcha National Park, half of which lies in Poland. This is all that remains of a canopy that eight centuries ago covered northern Europe. At least 55 mammal species, including deer, lynx, boar, wild horse, wolf, elk, ermine, badger, marten, otter, mink and beaver call this park home, but the area is most celebrated for its 300 or so European bison, the continent's largest land mammal. These free-range zubr – slightly smaller than their American cousins – were driven to near extinction (the last wild bison was shot by a hunter in 1919) then bred back from just 12 out of 52 surviving animals. Now about 5000 zubr exist, of which more than 300 are wild in this park.You have a chance to spot these beasts in the wild on a tour of the park, although you have to be a bit lucky. The October-to-April period offers the best odds. Volerei (enclosures; admission BYN2.50) near the entrance contain bison as well as deer, boar, elk, ostrich and other animals – including the rare hybrid Tarpan horse, a cross-breed of a species that was also shot into near extinction. Also near the entrance is a nature museum that gives a great introduction to the species living in the park.The easiest way to tour the park is by taking one of the two daily scheduled bus tours (adult/child BYN10/6, three hours, 11am and 2pm, in Russian only). About half of the tour is spent at a relatively interesting open-air ethnographic museum (free admission) within the park, where you'll sample home-made samahon (moonshine) with salo (cured pork fat). On the way back you'll stop at the 32m tall, 600-year-old Patriarch Oak tree.A better way to see the park is by hiring a bicycle at the park entrance. There are several sealed bike trails to choose from; the 27km 'big journey' and the 16km 'animal crossing' offer the best chance of spotting wildlife. Bike rental costs BYN9 to BYN15 and child seat's are available for BYN3. Hiking is another option, with several short loops originating at the park entrance. Serious hikers should talk to park staff about longer hikes. Driving your own car in the park costs BYN15 per hour and requires special permission and a park-appointed guide.The park headquarters runs four hotels near the park entrance, unimaginatively dubbed Hotels No 1, 2, 3 and 4. All have restaurants and there are several additional cafes near the park entrance serving up simple shashlyk (meat kebabs) and bliny (pancakes). Camping in the park requires permission and costs BYN15 per person.To get to the park from Brest, take a bus or marshrutka (fixed-route minivan) from the bus station (BYN5, 1¼ hours, seven daily). These terminate at the park entrance or at a bus stop nearby in the village of Kamyanyuki. The last trip back to Brest is at 6.40pm from Kamyanyuki. Hiring a taxi to the park should cost about BYN100 round-trip from Brest.An easier but more expensive option for visiting the park is to book a day trip with an English-speaking guide through a Brest travel agent."

President Lukashenko has allowed creative expression to flourish here with the expectation that it not spread to other parts of the capital, which remain sanitised and generally free of street art.\nThe district exudes a refreshing counterculture spirit and is one of the few places where you'll hear locals speaking Belarusian and/or talking about politics. Food-truck culture has taken root here and drinking on the street on any given evening is de rigueur."

Audioguides give much-needed context to the collection; for greater depth, book an English-language tour (in advance). Take bus number 1 from pl Svabody to get here."

        "detail_description": "One of the best-kept secrets in Belarus is this relatively untouched swath of marshes, swampland and floodplains emanating from the Pripyat River, about 250km due south of Minsk. The park headquarters are in the village of Lyaskavichy, in a complex that also includes a nature museum and a hotel. Make all your arrangements here. In late August or early September the whole area gets together for good clean country fun at the Polosye Festival in Lyaskavichy.\nKnown locally as 'the lungs of Europe', the park is a birdwatchers' paradise, with more than 250 avian species, mostly wetland varieties. There are also more than 800 types of plant and some 50 mammal species living in the park, including about 100 European bison.If you're planning multiple days in the park, you can enjoy forest lodging with guides for birdwatching, fishing, boating or, in the winter, ice-fishing (followed by vodka and a sauna, of course). Figure on BYN75 per person per day for room and board.If time is short, your best bet is a safari or a river cruise. The two-hour safaris (BYN8 for a public trip or BYN80 for a private trip) run only from September to May, when there is the best chance to spot bison, moose and other mammals; dusk yields the best results. A one-hour river cruise in a speedy aluminium outboard takes you along the Pripyat River and some of its tributaries, with plenty of birds to ogle along the way. These depart from the dock behind the Lyaskavichi Hotel and cost BYN50 for up to four people.Bicycle rides are possible with free bike hire from the hotels, although there aren't many navigable trails in the Lyaskavichy area. For forest biking or hiking, you're best off in the park's former headquarters, Turau, some 50km west (hire bikes and guides in Lyaskavichy before you head there).To get to Lyaskavichy from Minsk, take a marshrutka from the Central Bus Station to Zhytkavichy (BYN12, 3½ hours, six daily), then take a taxi (BYN15, 20 minutes) to the park headquarters. From points east or west, jump off the Homel–Brest train in Zhytkavichy."

Formerly pr Francyska Skaryny, it runs from what travel writer Colin Thubron dubbed the 'ferroconcrete tundra' of outer Minsk to the modern (read: Soviet) city centre, terminating just northeast of the train station at the stubbornly austere and expansive pl Nezalezhnastsi. The avenue is the world's premier embodiment of the post-WWII Stalinist Empire style, marked by expansive squares, utopian parks and palatial architectural gems like the Central Post Office.\nAt pl Nezalezhnastsi you can't miss the imposing Belarusian Government Building, fronted by a Lenin Statue. It is one of several fine examples of pre-WWII constructivist architecture in Minsk. Next to it is the 1910 red-brick Church of Sts Simon &amp; Helena, with its tall, gabled bell tower. Heading northeast, you'll pass the iconic, Stalinist Minsk Hotel and then come to the ominous KGB headquarters between vul Haradsky Val and vul Kamsamolskaya. Roughly opposite the KGB building is a long narrow park with a bust of Felix Dzerzhinsky, the founder of the Cheka (the KGB's predecessor) and a native of Belarus.A couple blocks further northeast is sweeping Kastrychnitskaya pl, and opposite this is Tsentralny skver, a leafy park on the site of a 19th-century marketplace. The dark-grey building to the northeast of Tsentralny sq is Dom Ofitserov (Officer's Building), which has a tank memorial at the front, devoted to the soldiers who freed Minsk from the Nazis. Southeast of the square, along vul Karla Marksa, is the seemingly lifeless, seriously guarded presidential residence.As pr Nezalezhnastsi crosses the Svislach River, it passes two of the city's main parks: Park Yanki Kupaly on the southwestern bank opposite the circus and the larger Gorky Central Children's Park, where there's a section with rides, attractions and fast-food kiosks. Just across the bridge, in a green wooden house by the banks of the river, is the House Museum of the First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Workers' Party, where the Russian Social-Democratic Workers Party – Russia's original Marxist party – held its illegal founding congress in 1898. Diagonally opposite the museum is the former residence of Lee Harvey Oswald.Just 100m northeast of here, pl Peramohi (ploshchad Pobedy in Russian) is marked by a giant Victory Obelisk and its eternal flame, which is directly beneath the obelisk underground. Further north is pl Jakuba Kolasa, another expansive square, this one softened by pleasant parkland and a sitting area near the elephantine monument to the Belarusian writer. A few metro stops northeast of there the National Library of Belarus, a ghastly piece of Lukashenko-approved hubris in the shape of a giant rhombicuboctahedron (look it up!)."

Sadly, there aren't more Chagall paintings in Belarus because his work was banned by the Soviet government: it even rejected a priceless cache of paintings bequeathed to it by the artist himself.Downstairs is a space for temporary exhibitions."

The assassin of former US president John F Kennedy lived here for a couple of years. The building has evolved since Oswald's time, but his apartment is thought to be at the far left (northwest) side of the building on the 3rd floor.\nHe arrived in Minsk in January 1960 after leaving the US Marines and defecting to the USSR. Once here, he truly went native: he got a job in a radio factory, married a Minsk woman, had a child – and even changed his name to Alek. But soon he returned to the United States and…you know the rest.If you want to see Oswald's apartment, get in touch with Hostel Tower 18/31 in the same building and see if the hostel can secure you an invite through the owner (we had no such luck)."

Of a population of 149 (including 85 children), only one man, Yuzif Kaminsky, survived. The site is now a sobering memorial not just to Khatyn but to all of the innocent victims and defenseless villages wiped out by the Nazis when they overran Belarus in WWII.\nThe Unconquered Man, a statue of Kaminsky carrying a small child, is one of the more moving images at this sprawling complex, where memorial obelisks dedicated to each slaughtered family chime in unison at 30-second intervals. Near the parking lot there's an exhibit of art and photographs – some quite disturbing. Tours of the complex are offered in Russian.Khatyn is 3km off the Minsk–Vitebsk highway. There is no public transport from Minsk; a taxi will cost about BYN80 return."

While not as developed as the similarly themed Dudutki museum nearby, this is a more authentic experience and a must for 19th-century rural-architecture buffs.\nEnjoy the rich scent of pinewood in the houses and the ripe smell of loam in the work sheds as you take in the complex, which is peppered with maple and apple trees. Festivals such as Kupalle (summer solstice festival) are a good time to visit, as the museum stays open late for dancing, singing and merrymaking. A 100-year-old tavern serves lunch. To get here take a Dubyantsy-bound bus from the Southwest Bus Station (BYN0.60, every 90 minutes). Ask your driver to let you off at the Azyartso (Ozertso) 'muzey' (museum)."

You'll be offered fresh salo (cured pork fat) with garlic, pickles dipped in honey and homemade samahon (moonshine). Take bus number 323 to Dudutki (BYN2.66, 1¼ hours) from Minsk's Central Bus Station. Departures are at 9.45am and 12.55pm.\nReturn trips are at 11.15am, 2.20pm and 5.40pm. A small souvenir market near the entrance sells crafts produced at the complex, the highlights being wool boots and slippers, and leather goods."

You can wander around the remains of the castle, with great views of the Neman River below, but the main attraction on the castle grounds is the Hrodna History and Archaeology Museum. It's a comprehensive walk through the history of the Hrodna region.\nEnglish placards accompany most exhibits. Highlights include a set of mammoth tusks, neolithic spears and arrowheads from 3 to 4 BC, an 18th-century dugout boat, and armour and other war paraphernalia from the Lithuanian period. There's a fine diorama of Hrodna in the 19th century and the requisite WWII displays of weaponry and Soviet propaganda posters."
