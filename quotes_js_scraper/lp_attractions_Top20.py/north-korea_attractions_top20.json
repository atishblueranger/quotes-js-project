        "detail_description": "This exhibition hosts a massive display of gifts given to Kim Il-sung, Kim Jong-il and Kim Jong-un. Housed in a mountainside vault that is vaguely reminiscent of a Bond villain's hideout, on display is everything from Kim family transportation to glassware and wax figurines.\nA member of your group may be honoured with the task of opening the vast doors that lead into the exhibit – after putting on ceremonial gloves to protect the polished doorknob, naturally.Kim Il-sung’s gifts are very impressive. Particularly noteworthy is the beautiful armoured train carriage presented to him by Mao Zedong and a limousine sent by that great man of the people, Josef Stalin. The exhibits are arranged geographically, although you will thankfully only be shown the highlights of the 100,000-plus gifts that are spread over 120 rooms. Gifts from heads of state are displayed on red cloth, those from other officials on blue and gifts from individuals on brown. The undeniable highlight is a stuffed caiman (small reptile related to the alligator) holding a tray of wooden cups, presented to the Great Leader by the Sandinistas, a Nicaraguan socialist political party.The tone of the visit is very strict and sombre, so avoid the very real temptation to ice-skate across the over-polished floor in your foot covers. The most reverential and surreal part of the exhibit is the final room, in which there is a grinning life-sized waxwork of the Great Leader, to which you will be expected to bow your head before leaving respectfully.Next is Kim Jong-il’s similarly spectacular warehouse, where gifts given to him have been housed in a vault built into the cave wall. Kim Jong-il's gifts include those from Hyundai and CNN, as well as a good-luck note from Jimmy Carter and a basketball from Madeleine Albright. Indeed, some parts of the exhibit look like any upmarket electronics showroom – row after row of wide-screen TVs and stereo equipment donated by industrialists. There's also a rendering of the Dear Leader in wax here. In recent years gifts to Kim Jong-un have been added to this section of the IFE."

        "detail_description": "Paekdu, one of the most stunning sights on the Korean peninsula, straddles the Chinese–Korean border in the very far northeastern tip of DPRK. Apart from being the country's highest mountain at 2744m (9000ft), and an amazing geological phenomenon (an extinct volcano with a vast crater lake at its centre), it's also of huge mythical importance to Koreans.\nThe natural beauty of the extinct volcano, now containing one of the world’s deepest lakes, is made all the more magical by the mythology that surrounds the lake, both ancient and modern. The legend runs that Hwanung, the Lord of Heaven, descended onto the mountain in 2333 BC, and from here formed the nation of Choson – ‘The Land of Morning Calm’, or ancient Korea. It therefore only seems right and proper that, four millennia later, Kim Jong-il was born nearby ‘and flying white horses were seen in the sky’, according to official sources. In all likelihood, Kim Jong-il was born in Khabarovsk, Russia, where his father was in exile at the time, but this story contributes to the all-important Kim myth that has contributed to the family's continued cult of personality.Trips here are strictly organised as this is a sensitive border region and a military zone. Having arrived at the military station at the bottom of the mountain, you’ll be checked in, then will take the funicular railway up the side of the mountain. From here it’s a 10-minute hike up to the mountain’s highest point, past some superb views down into the crater lake. You can either walk down to the shore of Lake Chon (an easy hike down, but somewhat tougher coming back up!) or take the cable car (€7 per person return) for the easier option. Bring warm clothing; it can be freezing at any time of year, with snow on the ground year-round.Revisionist history aside, the real reason to visit Paekdusan is the natural beauty of the area – vast tracts of virgin forest, abundant wildlife, lonely granite crags, fresh springs, gushing streams and dramatic waterfalls – and, for those able to make the steep and treacherous climb, the astounding Jong-il Peak. It is accessible only from around late June to mid-September (due to weather conditions) and can be reached only by charter flight from Pyongyang, followed by a 1½-hour bus ride."

        "detail_description": "The sad sight of a divided nation remains one of the most poignant aspects of any trip to North Korea. Even if you're just in North Korea for a couple of days, almost every tour includes a trip to the DMZ. Seeing the situation from the North – facing off against US and South Korean troops to the south – is a unique chance to witness things from an alternative perspective.\nThe eerily quiet drive from Pyongyang down the six-lane Reunification Hwy – the road is deserted save for military checkpoints – gives you a sense of what to expect. Just before you exit to the DMZ, the sign saying ‘Seoul 70km’ is a reminder of just how close and yet how far is normality.There are several aspects to a DMZ visit. Your first stop will be at a KPA post just outside the DMZ. Here a soldier will show you a model of the entire site, pointing out South Korean as well as North Korean headquarters and watchtowers. Then you’ll be marched (single file!) through an anti-tank barrier to rejoin your bus, and you’ll be driven down a long concrete corridor. Look out for the tank traps either side – huge slabs of concrete ready to be dropped into the road at any minute in the event of a land invasion.The next stop is the Armistice Talks Hall, about 1km into the DMZ. Here negotiations were held between the two sides from 1951 until the final armistice, which was signed here on 27 July 1953. You’ll see two copies of the agreement on display in glass cases, along with the original North Korean and UN flags. Next door there’s an exhibition of photos from the war. Outside, a plaque in red script best sums up the North Korean version of the ceasefire. It reads: 'It was here on July 27, 1953 that the American imperialists got down on their knees before the heroic Chosun people to sign the ceasefire for the war they had provoked June 25, 1950.'From here you’ll reboard the bus and drive to the Demarcation Line itself, and you'll be reminded in more than usually severe language about sticking together ‘for your own safety’. The site consists of two sinister-looking headquarters staring at each other across the line (the North Korean one is built to be the bigger of the two) and several huts built over the line for meetings. Amazingly, you can cross a few metres into South Korea within the huts, but the doors out to the south are closed and guarded by two soldiers.Being at the centre of the biggest military face-off on Earth is rather like being in the eye of a storm – tension is in the air, but it appears so peaceful that it makes the very idea of imminent combat seem ridiculous. South Korean and American soldiers eyeball their northern counterparts as they have done every day since 1953. Do not be fooled by the prevailing air of calm, though: any attempt to even approach the border will result in your being shot at, possibly from both sides. In the 1980s, however, a Soviet tourist found a unique way to flee the communist bloc, defecting amid gunfire from both sides. In recent years, North Korean soldiers have made the dash successfully in 2012, 2015, 2016 and 2017.The other interesting sight at the DMZ is the Concrete Wall, a US-constructed anti-tank barrier that runs the length of the 248km border. It has been hijacked as an emotive propaganda weapon by the North, which since 1989 has been comparing it with the Berlin Wall. Indeed, the issue has proved an emotive one in the South as well, where students have demanded it be dismantled. You will inspect the wall with binoculars and be shown a particularly bizarre North Korean propaganda video."

You'll also have to go through airport-style security – you're allowed to take nothing with you – and pass along miles of slow red moving sidewalks and then be dusted off by both automatic shoe cleaners and a giant clothes-dusting machine to ensure no dirt is trampled into either viewing hall. Items on display include the train carriage where Kim Jong-il died, the Dear Leader's boat and a collection of his medals and cars."

However, it's been recently 'discovered' that Kochoson was in northern Korea, its capital right where Pyongyang now stands, and that Tan'gun was a real man (and a Kim at that); archaeologists have also discovered his skeletal remains. Those decayed bones (and those said to be of his wife) are on display at a grandly constructed white pyramid mausoleum just outside of Pyongyang. A small museum stands nearby, displaying 'artefacts' from Tan'gun's times, said to have been found in and around the tomb."

The original statue was initially covered in gold leaf, but this was removed at the objection of the Chinese, who were effectively funding the North Korean economy, and today's scrubbed bronze prevailed.\nAs the epicentre of the Kim cult, visitors need to be aware of the seriousness (officially, at least) with which North Koreans regard this monument and the respect they believe visitors should accord it. Your tour leader will buy flowers and elect one member of the group to place them at the statue’s feet. As this is done, the whole group will be expected to bow.

        "detail_description": "Set in a huge clearing in the woods with views to Paekdusan and overlooking a large lake, this must be North Korea's most impressive paean to the leadership outside Pyongyang. The monument commemorates the battle of Pochombo, where anti-Japanese forces first moved from guerrilla tactics to conventional warfare and took the town of the same name.\nThe centrepiece is a 15m-high statue of a 27-year-old Kim Il-sung, as well as a smaller version of Pyongyang’s Juche Tower and several large sculptures of various revolutionary scenes."

The network, which is made up of two lines, has a simultaneous function as a nuclear bunker in the event of a long-anticipated American invasion. Stations are deep below ground and you can even see blast doors that will close if Pyongyang ever comes under nuclear bombardment.\nNowadays a trip usually takes in several stations, although the entire network can be visited on specialist tours, disproving the long-standing rumours that much of the network isn't actually in use."
