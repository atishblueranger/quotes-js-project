Inside the former Methodist Mission Church, home interiors have been recreated, alongside photographs, recordings and testimonials, all of which build an evocative picture of a shattered but not entirely broken community.Many township tours stop here first to explain the history of the pass laws.\nDisplays include a map of District Six on which former residents have labelled where their demolished homes and features of their neighbourhood once stood, reconstructions of home interiors, and faded photographs and recordings. Many of the staff, practically all displaced residents themselves, have heartbreaking stories to tell.The museum’s annexe, the Homecoming Centre, is open occasionally for temporary exhibitions and events."

One of South Africa's most important historical sites, the deeply moving and inspirational exhibitions here are split across four locations: the Old Fort, which dates from 1892 and was once a notorious prison for white males; the horrific Number Four Jail, reserved for nonwhite males; the Women's Jail; and the Awaiting Trial Block – now mostly demolished and replaced by the Constitutional Court. Tours depart on the hour and provide essential context.\nWhat you will hear and see will be shocking – the brutal facts of prisoners' incarceration here speak volumes. You will come away with an integral understanding of the legal and historical ramifications of the struggle. Many of the country’s high-profile political activists, including Nelson and Winnie Mandela and Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi, were once held here. Most tours last one hour and cover the Number Four Jail and Constitutional Court; tours at 10am and 1pm last two hours and cover all sections of the hill. After the tour you are free to wander around.If visiting with children ask directions to Play Africa, an interactive children's play facility in a previously unused section of the Old Fort. Also keep an eye out for regular concerts and cultural events hosted at Constitution Hill.There's a good cafe, called the Hill, inside the Old Fort."

You’ll find a fragrance garden that has been elevated so you can more easily sample the scents of the plants; a Braille trail; a kopje (hill) planted with pelargoniums; a sculpture garden; a section devoted to 'useful' medicinal plants; two hiking trails up Table Mountain (Skeleton Gorge and Nursery Ravine); and the significant remains of Van Riebeeck's Hedge, the wild almond hedge planted by Jan van Riebeeck in 1660 to form the boundary of the Dutch outpost.The outdoor Summer Sunset Concerts, held here on Sundays between November and April, are a Cape Town institution. The gardens are a stop on the City Sightseeing bus. The quiet Gate 3 (aka Rycroft Gate) is the first you’ll come to if you approach the gardens up Rhodes Dr from the south. There are three cafes, including the excellent Kirstenbosch Tea Room."

Beautiful granite kopjes (hills) pepper the bushveld in the south, the Lebombo Mountains rise from the savannah in the east and tropical forests cut across the far north.But what makes Kruger truly special is the access and opportunities it provides the visitor. A vast network of roads is there to explore on your own (incredibly), guided wildlife activities are everywhere and accommodation is both plentiful and great value."

It's a lovely estate to visit with an unusual late-18th-century manor house overlooking verdant lawns, as well as the Quaffee coffee roastery, Coffee Bloc cafe, a restaurant and gift shop.\nBeg, borrow or steal to snag a bottle of its delicious – but limited-release – Christine bordeaux blend. The creamy chardonnay and richly textured cabernet sauvignon are also standout wines."

Resembling a giant basket, it seats 56,000 people, and its arch was inspired by the ‘Y’ in the country’s flag. Visitors can head up to the arch in a SkyCar, puff up on foot (550 steps) on an Adventure Walk or plunge off the 106m arch on the giant Big Swing. All options offer great views of Durban.\nCafes line a section of the stadium base; from here you can explore on a Segway, hire a bike or walk to the beachfront on the pedestrian promenade."

Initially a garrison for soldiers in the mid-18th century, this area of town was where freed slaves started to settle after emancipation in the 1830s. The most picturesque streets are Chiappini, Rose and Wale.\n"

Look out for special events in the summer months, including open-air cinema evenings and live entertainment.\n"
