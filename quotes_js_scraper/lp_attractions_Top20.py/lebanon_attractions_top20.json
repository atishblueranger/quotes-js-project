        "detail_description": "The largest of Lebanon’s three natural protectorates, comprising an incredible 5% of the total land area, this is the largest natural cedar reserve in the country and has more than 250km of hiking trails. It's wonderful to see these beautiful trees in their natural environment, and the cool mountain climate makes a welcome change from the sweltering coast. There are several entrances, all with short-distance hiking trails to observe the cedars and access to longer trails.\nAt the entrances (Ain Zhalta, Barouk, Maasser, Niha, Mrusti and Aammiq) you will find ranger huts with restrooms – you should be able to negotiate to hire a hiking guide at each of these or obtain information about hiking trails. Those wanting to overnight nearby should check the website for details of the reserve's guesthouses.The most interesting of the nodes is Maasser, where you can stroll for an hour or so among the trees, see a particularly venerable one and rest under the famous Lamartine cedar, whose spreading boughs cover a little nest in the rock. Both here and at Barouk, the trees are some 6km above the village.Within the park are ancient rock-cut fortress remains as well as six of the country’s last remaining cedar forests, some with trees thought to be around 2000 years old. More than 200 species of birds and mammals (including wolves, gazelles, porcupines and wild boar) inhabit or regularly pass through the area. The reserve incorporates the Ammiq Wetland, a remnant of the extensive marshes and lakes that once covered parts of the Bekaa Valley. The last significant wetland in Lebanon, it's an important staging and wintering area for migratory water birds en route between Europe and Africa."

        "detail_description": "Located on the former Green Line, this is Beirut's major cultural institution. Its impressive, magnificently displayed collection of archaeological artefacts offers a great overview of Lebanon’s history and the civilisations that impacted this cultural crossroads. Highlights include the famous, much-photographed Phoenician gilded bronze figurines found buried near the Obelisk Temple at Byblos; a series of human-faced Phoenician sarcophagi and a frescoed Roman tomb, these latter in the outstanding basement, reopened in 2016.\nAt the start of your visit, leave your passport at the front desk and borrow one of the museum's complimentary iPads so that you can scan labels on significant pieces in the collection to receive a commentary about each (bring your own headphones if possible). You may also wish to view the 12-minute documentary that is screened in the audiovisual room off the foyer, which plays every hour on the hour between 9am and 4pm. This details how curators saved the museum's collection during the civil war and subsequently restored it to its former glory.It's worth starting your visit on the upper floor (take the right-hand stairs to go chronologically forwards) as this gives you an overview of the sweep of Lebanese history and lets you sort out your Seleucids from your Phoenicians. The collection of Bronze Age artefacts here is of extraordinary quality: as well as the Byblos figurines, admire the obsidian-and-gold coffer and Egyptian gold pectorals found in the same royal necropolis, and the exquisite ivory make-up boxes from Saida. Other highlights include an extraordinary Attic drinking vessel in the shape of a pig's head; a marble head of Bacchus from the Roman period; and a magnificent collection of Phoenician glass.On the ground floor, some excellent Byzantine mosaics are notable, as well as two wonderful carved sarcophagi from Tyre dating from the 2nd century AD: one depicts drunken cupids and the other the legend of Achilles. Also here are the much-loved Phoenician statues of baby boys; these were commissioned by aristocrats from Saida as ex-votos to Echmoun, the Phoenican god of healing, to thank him for saving their children.The atmospheric and beautifully presented basement (easily missed; look behind the stairs) is a standout, holding the eerie series of human-faced sarcophagi from Saida as well as an intriguing reconstruction of a 2nd-century AD collective tomb from Tyre, with wall paintings depicting mythological scenes. Much earlier Chalcolithic pot burials are also interesting, while three evocatively mummified bodies and perfectly preserved clothing tell a poignant 13th-century story. Perhaps fleeing from the Crusader wars, they died in a Qadisha Valley cave still clutching the title deeds to their land, foreshadowing a story repeated in refugee camps across Lebanon today."

        "detail_description": "Sitting majestically on a hill surrounded by terraced gardens and orchards, Beiteddine Palace is one of the highlights of the Chouf Mountains. This restored 19th-century gem features sumptuous interiors, views over the surrounding hills and an important archaeological collection. Although conceived by Italian architects, the palace incorporates many traditional forms of Arab design and is a model of elegance. In summer, it's the venue of a well-known arts festival. The village is around 50km southeast of Beirut.\nBeiteddine Palace was built over a period of 30 years in the early 19th century by Emir Bashir Chehab II, Ottoman-appointed governor of the region. Its name means ‘House of Faith’, acknowledging the older Druze hermitage that originally occupied the site. During the French mandate the palace was used for local administration, and after 1930 it was declared a historic monument. In 1943 Lebanon’s first president after independence declared it his summer residence. The palace was extensively damaged during the Israeli invasion; it’s estimated that up to 90% of the original contents were lost during this time. When fighting ended in 1984, the site was claimed by the Druze militia, and Walid Jumblatt, the Druze leader, ordered its restoration. In 1999 the Druze returned it to the government.The main gate opens onto a 60m-wide outer courtyard (Dar Al Baraniyyeh) that’s walled on three sides only; the fourth side has views over the surrounding valleys and hills. The archaeological collection off this space was closed for restoration at last visit.A double staircase on the outer courtyard’s western side leads into a smaller central courtyard (Dar Al Wousta) with a fountain. Beyond this courtyard (accessed from its northern side) is the third – and last – inner courtyard (Dar Al Harim). This was the centre of the family quarters, and incorporates a beautiful hammam and huge kitchens.Underneath the Dar Al Wousta (accessed via a doorway near the staircase) are the former stables, now home to an outstanding collection of 5th- and 6th-century Byzantine mosaics. Found at Jiyyeh, 30km south of Beirut, they were brought by Walid Jumblatt to Beiteddine in 1982. Whatever you do, don’t miss them: they’re truly stunning. During the arts festival, this area serves as the backstage area and is likely off limits.The only food options in Beiteddine are a few snack bars. You'll need to eat at the nearby Mir Amin Palace or bring a picnic with you to eat in the palace garden beside the beautiful open-air mosaics.Minibuses ('Chouf Buses') from Beirut’s Cola transport hub can drop passengers at Douwwar, which is within walking distance of Beiteddine (LL3000, 45 minutes, every 30 minutes between 7.30am and 4pm). Taxis waiting there can take you to Deir Al Qamar, wait while you explore there and then bring you back to the palace (US$40). Alternatively, it's a picturesque but hilly one-hour walk between Deir Al Qamar and the palace.A taxi will charge around US$125 to take you from Beirut to to Deir Al Qamar and Beiteddine, wait while you explore both, and then return you to Beirut."

This bleak but strategically important mountaintop, covered in oak trees and rocky caves, was one of the spots where Hezbollah resistance fighters were garrisoned during the occupation.\nThe principal exhibits include a rousing 12-minute film about the occupation and resistance, an introductory exhibition and 'The Abyss', a bizarre pit structure filled with armoured vehicles and weapons abandoned by the Israelis. Landmine and cluster bomb remnants serve as a reminder of the brutality inflicted on Lebanese civilians. From here, you can follow paths that the fighters took through the forest, enter the tunnel system where they sheltered, and admire the views from their lookout points. Well-maintained rose gardens commemorate the dead.There's nothing balanced about the historical narrative being recounted here; elements of the very real Lebanese tragedy and cynical global realpolitik that exacerbated it are juxtaposed with dogmatic fantasy. The insight that it offers into the Hezbollah point of view is fascinating; there's nothing else in Lebanon quite like it. Guides (free) speak many languages.Mleeta is an 82km (approximately 90-minute) drive southeast of Beirut, via Saida. Tyre is another 50km (one hour) south. You'll need a car to get here, as there is no public transport. Allow two hours for your visit."

The flooded lower caves, reached via a tacky toy train, are explored by rowing boat and are closed when the flood levels rise too high.\nDiscovered in 1836 and opened as a tourist attraction in 1969, the caves were used as an ammunition store during the civil war, despite the flooding from the Nahr El Kalb (or Dog River) for which they form the source.Bear in mind that there’s no photography allowed: you can stow your camera in lockers at the mouth of the caverns. The ticket price includes the toy train and cable-car rides, grotto entrance and a 20-minute video presentation about the caves (screened at different times of the day in English, French and Arabic). Allow 90 minutes for your visit. There's also a tourist office here.To get to the grotto, take a minibus (LL1500) or LCC bus 6 (LL1500) from Dawra and ask the driver to drop you at the Jeita turn-off on the Beirut–Jounieh Hwy. From here, negotiate a return price with a waiting taxi for the 5km journey (around US$15 to US$20, according to demand), and make sure to figure in waiting time. Alternatively, a return taxi trip from Beirut should cost around US$60 including waiting time."

        "detail_description": "Built over the remains of a Roman temple, this 18th-century Maronite monastery was extensively damaged during the civil war but has been fully restored. A few of the original Roman-era columns remain, one of which is built into the current building's wall. A working monastery, it is surrounded by formal gardens and has a scenic terrace.\nJust before the gates of the monastery, on the left-hand side of the road, are overgrown ruins dating from the Roman and Byzantine periods. The most interesting of these is a section of Byzantine mosaic flooring; you'll find this behind the house closest to the gate.To reach the monastery, head towards St George's Church (signposted) at the lower end of Beit Mery's main street and then continue uphill and around the bend past the modern municipality building."

Conceived and funded by jeweller and collector Robert Mouawad to showcase his magnificent and eclectic collection of art, furniture, carpets and antiquities, it is housed in the former home of the late Lebanese politician and art collector Henri Philippe Pharaoun, and set in lush gardens. At time of research, it was closed for extensive refurbishment and no date had been set for reopening.\nBuilt in the neo-Gothic style in 1911, the mansion was significantly rebuilt and totally redecorated by Pharaoun, and reflects his infatuation with Islamic art and architecture. Decorative wooden panels throughout the house date back to the 19th century and were largely sourced in Syria. Exhibits range from Byzantine icons, Mamluk ceramics and classical statuary to the Mouawad-produced 'Very Expensive Fantasy Bra', encrusted with precious stones, which is worth US$11 million (yes, really)."

The entrance leads to an attractive courtyard, off which there is an apartment with wooden panelling, domed ceiling and a window offering views over the valley.\nBehind this building it's worth exploring steep and narrow cobbled streets, honey-hued stone houses and two churches: the 17th-century Our Lady of the Rosary and the 18th-century Church of St Elie."

Turn right once through the main university entrance. Note that the museum is closed during university holidays. Audioguides can be hired for LL3000.\nThe museum runs monthly lectures throughout the year, hosts temporary exhibitions and children's activities, and is involved in ongoing excavations in Lebanon and Syria."
