        "detail_description": "Dallas means many things to many people, but for tourists, the city is still indelibly linked to the assassination of President John F Kennedy. Movies and conspiracy theories have kept this momentous event alive in the popular consciousness ever since 22 November 1963. To understand what unfolded on that fateful day, the best place to start is the museum set in the very room in the former Texas School Book Depository where Lee Harvey Oswald – then an employee – lay in wait.\n\n  \nLooking across Dealey Plaza towards the former Texas School Book Depository © Alamy Stock Photo\n\nExploring the museum\nHoused on the sixth floor of the Book Depository, spanning the storage rooms where Oswald planned out and executed his deadly plot, this fascinating museum uses multimedia exhibits tell the story of JFK's life and times, not just his final moments. Photos and filmed footage – including footage shot by bystanders on the day of the assassination – provide some excellent historical context to help visitors understand JFK's lifetime and legacy.\nJust as interesting are the exhibits on Oswald himself, and the opportunities that were missed to stop the events of 22 November 1963. An Italian-made Mannlicher-Carcano rifle – the same model used by Oswald – is displayed in the corner staircase, one of several parts of the museum that have been restored to match the way they appeared on the day of the assassination.\n\n  \nDisplays on the fateful day at the Sixth Floor Museum ©Shutterstock / Gilberto Mesquita\n\nIt’s shocking to realise just how close Kennedy's limo was to Oswald's sniper nest, but don’t worry if you have any doubts about the single-shooter explanation – the museum doesn't shy away from the myriad conspiracy theories. Should you wish to delve further, several local conspiracy theorists offer tours around Dealey Plaza and the Grassy Knoll that talk visitors through their own extravagant versions of events.\nEven without a guide, it's worth wandering over to Elm Street, to see the 'X' marking the spot where JFK was hit as his motorcade trundled slowly past the Texas School Book Depository. There's an undeniable sense of momentous history here, even 60 years after the event. The park at Dealey Plaza was actually created to mark the location of the original settlement of Dallas, but today, visitors are much more interested in the Grassy Knoll, and the rumors of a second shooter that have ricocheted through history.\n\n  \nThe Kennedy assassination transformed Dealy Plaza into an American landmark ©f11photo / Getty Images\n\nThe museum story\nAfter the assassination, the building that changed American history was tagged for demolition, but Dallas governor Wes Wise pushed back against the plans and the former Texas School Book Depository was saved for posterity. The depot continued to serve as a store for school books until 1970, when it passed into private hands, before being redeveloped to house the Sixth Floor Museum and the offices of the Dallas County Administration in the 1980s.\nDespite the rather gruesome subject matter, the museum is today a worthy addition to the list of best things to see in Dallas, and it's also an educational experience for children, though it probably has more resonance for US citizens than visiting youngsters. Across the plaza, the Old Red Museum has gentler exhibits on Dallas history, and just behind is architect Philip Johnson's John F Kennedy Memorial, a roofless cenotaph designed to capture the sense of change and freedom epitomized by JFK's presidency.\nTickets &amp; Practicalities\nTickets are easy to buy at the museum on the day, or you can book online. Bring a picnic to eat on Dealey Plaza in the middle of history.\n"

        "detail_description": "The River Walk is a 15-mile-long glorious network of waterside pathways that’s tucked below street level and lined with bars and restaurants. It's the perfect place for many leisurely strolls through downtown and beyond, and considered one of the top things to do in San Antonio. You'll pass landscaped gardens and riverfront cafes, and linger on stone footbridges that arch across the water.\nDuring summer it gets mighty crowded, but at peaceful times (and the further you get from downtown) it's a lovely place to be – especially during the holidays, when it's bedecked with twinkling lights.\nRiver Walk extension\nThese days, the River Walk extends way north and south of downtown. The 8-mile Mission Reach expansion extends south to the King William District and beyond to the Spanish missions, while the 4-mile Museum Reach stretches north to the San Antonio Art Museum, the Pearl Brewery complex and Brackenridge Park.\n\n  \nTake a 35-minute tour of the river by boat © f11photo / Shutterstock\n\nRiver Walk restaurants\nHaving a location beside the pretty River Walk gives any restaurant instant atmosphere, especially when there's a patio involved, but typical prices are high, and there's no guarantee of quality. Decent options include Biga on the Banks, serving a wonderful mix of European, Tex-Mex, American and Asian influences, and local favorite Texas bistro Boudro's.\nRiver Walk boat tour\nAfter you've had your fill of walking by the river, hop on a Go Rio cruise. These 35-minute narrated cruises leave every 15 to 20 minutes, and give a good visual overview of the river plus a light history lesson. No reservations are necessary; buy tickets online or at the ticket booths found at 706 River Walk, Rivercenter and Aztec Theater.\n\n  \nThere's a bike rental point at the Blue Star Arts Complex on the River Walk © JustPixs / Shutterstock\n\nCycling the River Walk\nDowntown you cannot ride a bike on the River Walk and must ride on surrounding streets. Once you get out of downtown, however, you can ride your bike on long stretches of the River Walk. Beyond Lexington Avenue, follow the River Walk north to the Pearl Brewery complex and the Brackenridge Park area's attractions (the Museum Reach). South of downtown, from Nueva Street, you can cycle to the historic missions (the Mission Reach), with a walk-your-bike section near the Blue Star Brewery Complex. Before setting out, confirm the cycling start points with the visitor center and obey current signage so you don't get a ticket. The San Antonio River Authority website has some useful information. Check San Antonio's bike-share scheme for rental locations. \nCreation of the River Walk\nIn 1921, floods destroyed downtown San Antonio when water 10ft deep gushed through the center of the city from the overflowing San Antonio River, obliterating homes and businesses and drowning as many as 50 people. As a result, the Olmos Dam was constructed to handle overflow and route the extra water around the downtown area through a canal called the Oxbow.\nIt was a temporary fix that was intended to be submerged and turned into an enormous storm drain beneath the city. Before this happened though, some locals formed the San Antonio Conservation Society and dedicated themselves to preserving and developing the canal into an attraction.\nIn 1938 the Works Progress Administration (WPA) assumed control of the canal's fate, and executed a plan to develop a central business district of shops and restaurants along a cobbled walk. More than 1000 jobs were created during the construction of River Walk, and the project is one of the most beautiful results of the WPA effort.\n"

        "detail_description": "For proud Texans, the much-fabled Alamo, entered freely off San Antonio’s central plaza, is not so much a tourist attraction as a place of pilgrimage. Many visitors get downright dewy-eyed as they explore the site of the 1836 siege, in which a few hundred revolutionaries, including Davy Crockett, William Travis and James Bowie, died defending the fort against thousands of Mexican troops.\nBuilt as a mission church from 1755 onwards, the main building is now known as the Shrine. Beyond that, various exhibition areas in the Alamo Exhibit tell substantially the same story of the Battle of the Alamo – not that historians entirely agree on the details – in different ways. Thus living-history enactors perform in the Cavalry Courtyard, while there’s a more traditional museum in the Long Barrack, originally a residence for the Spanish priests and later a hospital for Mexican and Texan troops. A 17-minute film provides another perspective on the battle, and makes an excellent opportunity to escape the heat.\n\n  \nFree timed-entry tickets to the church must be reserved in advance © Stephen B. Goodwin / Shutterstock\n\nThe Battle of the Alamo\nIt's hard to tell the story of the Battle of the Alamo. There's hot debate about the number of defenders and of Mexican troops and casualties, among many other details. Objective, first-hand accounts have been, to date, impossible to find.\nIt is generally agreed that on February 23, 1836, Mexican general Antonio López de Santa Anna led anywhere from 2500 to 5000 Mexican troops in an attack against the Alamo. The 160 or so men inside the fortress included James Bowie (of Bowie-knife fame), who was in command of the Alamo until pneumonia rendered him too sick; William B Travis, who took command of the troops after Bowie's incapacity; and perhaps most famous of all, David Crockett, called \"Davy\" by everyone. Crockett, a three-time US congressman from Tennessee with infamous taste in headgear, first gained fame as a frontiersman and then for his public arguments with President Andrew Jackson over the latter's murderous campaigns of Native American \"removal\" in the southeastern USA. However, less is known about the African Americans, enslaved by Bowie and Travis, who fought alongside them during the battle and were two of the only male survivors.\nTravis dispatched a now-famous letter to other revolutionaries pleading for reinforcements, saying that his men would not stand down under any circumstances – his call was for \"victory or death.\" Because of slow communications, the only reinforcements that arrived in time were a group of about 30 men from Gonzales, Texas, bringing the total number of Alamo defenders up to 189 – at least according to literature from the Daughters of the Republic of Texas (DRT), which lists the names of all but one, an unidentified African American man.\nSanta Anna's troops pounded the Alamo for 13 days before retaking it. Mexican losses were devastating; estimates run as low as 1000 and as high as 2000. When the Alamo was finally recaptured, the advancing troops executed almost all of the surviving defenders. The few who were spared were interrogated and released.\nTickets and tours\nTickets to the church are free, but timed-entry must be booked in advance. To explore further, you'll need to either join a one-hour guided tour or purchase the Victory or Death Audio Tour, a 45-minute self-guided tour that brings the story of the Alamo to life. This will also give you access to the Alamo Exhibit, which includes the world's largest private collection of Alamo memorabilia, donated by British singer Phil Collins in 2014.\n"

Just six miles from downtown, it's one of the city's loveliest green spaces, and a great place to escape Dallas' motor city vibe and breathe clean, plant-filtered air.\n\n  \nDale Chihuly sculptures at the Dallas Arboretum © Prisma by Dukas Presseagentur GmbH / Alamy Stock Photo\n\nExploring the Dallas Arboretum &amp; Botanical Gardens\nThe gardens that make up the Dallas Arboretum were once part of a private estate known as Rancho Encinal, built for geophysicist Everette Lee DeGolyer, who – predictably, for Texas – made his mark in the petroleum industry, working as a field geologist for big oil companies. The garden that remains today was established by his wife, Nell DeGolyer, offsetting a little of the carbon released by Texas oil. The gardens were later expanded to include the neighboring Alex Camp House and grounds.\nToday, it's a place to escape the city traffic and recharge in front of elegant floral beds and trimmed topiary, admiring the views across the lake to the Dallas' skyline. There's an appealing courtyard restaurant in the former DeGolyer ranch (with indoor and outdoor dining), but the best place to eat is on a picnic blanket laid out on the lakeshore. Some parts of the garden feel European, others feel Japanese – the graceful Sunken Garden hints at the urbane tastes of the wealthy families who set up home on this stretch of the lakeshore, suggesting Great Gatsby-style garden parties.\nMore themed gardens are dotted around the grounds – look out for the Woman’s Garden, an elegant space of water features, terraced walkways and bronze nudes set in free-standing stone picture frames. Expect to see plenty of wedding parties posing for pictures amid the posies.\nIt's also a great spot for families traveling to Dallas with younger children. The Rory Meyers Children's Adventure Garden was designed to connect kids with the natural environment, with zones laid out specifically to appeal to different age groups.\n\n  \nThe Rory Meyers Children's Adventure Garden was designed to connect kids with nature ©Shutterstock / Ritu Manoj Jethani\n\nTickets &amp; Practicalities\nTickets for the gardens are best reserved online in advance. This is doubly true during the spring wildflower season when it can get so mobbed in the gardens that nearby streets are closed. Other busy times to visit include Christmas, when the arboretum hosts the the 12 Days of Christmas display, and fall, when the Arboretum is filled with pumpkins arranged into artistic patterns.\nThe March cherry blossom season also pulls in a crowd, with 150 cherry trees filling the gardens with snow-drifts of fallen petals. Parking is expensive – book online before you pull in for a $5 discount. During the month of August, the admission fee drops to $2 per person and parking drops to $5 all-in.\n"

        "detail_description": "For a Texas-sized photo op, or simply a sight of what claims to be the largest bronze monument on earth, head to Pioneer Plaza in the heart of Dallas. Multiple strands of American history come together at this downtown tourist site – the plaza's famous monument commemorates the epic cattle drives that followed the Shawnee Trail across the West, and it borders the Pioneer Cemetery, last resting place of multiple Dallas mayors and numerous participants in the Texas revolution and the American Civil War.\nVisiting Pioneer Plaza\nThe patch of land now occupied by Pioneer Plaza was once a vacant lot, cleared for an ambitious skyscraper project that never got off the ground. Today, it's one of Dallas' most popular photo opportunities, thanks to the creativity of self-trained Texan sculptor, Robert Summers. In 1994 Summers filled the park with figures of 49 bronze longhorn cattle and three cowboys, surging across a stream bed in the shadow of the towers of downtown Dallas. It's certainly worth dropping by while touring the downtown sights.\nThe monument is a homage to the Texas cattle drives, which moved untold thousands of longhorns across the state to waiting railroad cars in the 19th century. While the Shawnee Trail did pass through Dallas, it was rapidly eclipsed by the much bigger Chisholm Trail through Fort Worth, which became the hub of the Texan cattle trade (visit the city's famous Stockyards to delve deeper into Fort Worth's 'Cowtown' history).\nThe bronze Dallas herd is executed in almost Terracotta Army levels of detail, right down to the 'd' (for 'Dallas') branding marks. You can wander on to the nearby Pioneer Cemetery, which does indeed include some bona fide American pioneers, alongside many casualties and veterans of America's civil war. Until recently, this was also the site of Dallas' Confederate War Memorial, but the monument was removed following Black Lives Matter protests in 2020.\n\n  \nTexas longhorns charge through downtown Dallas ©Shutterstock / Alizada Studios\n\nWhen the cemetery received its first burials in the 1850s, Dallas was a country township of just 1000 people. Some of the souls interred here arrived on stagecoaches and covered wagons before the railroad trundled into town in the 1870s. The Confederate connection may be controversial today, but Dallas was a key battleground in the civil war, with Texans fighting on both sides before the South finally surrendered in 1865. Amongst the civic figures buried here is former mayor John McClannahan Crockett (1816–1877), cousin of Davy Crockett.\nPracticalities\nPioneer Plaza and the cemetery are open to all, but parking can be tricky if you just want to hop out and take a few snaps. There are usually some spots on Griffin St and Young St, but otherwise, you'll have to pay to park in a downtown parking lot. On the plus side, you're just a few blocks from Dealey Plaza, the JFK Memorial, and the Sixth Floor Museum.\n"

Founded in 1903, the Dallas Museum of Art is an impressively cosmopolitan endeavour, with a collection that spans the history of creativity in Europe as well as the Americas. It put Dallas firmly on the national culture map when it opened, and it still attracts a healthy crowd of visitors today.\n\n  \nThe eye-catching frontage of the Dallas Museum of Art (DMA) ©Shutterstock / Gilberto Mesquita\n\nExploring the Dallas Museum of Art\nYou've probably seen art museums that are snootily reverent towards modern fine artists, and dismissive of historic and tribal art from the rest of the world. That's not the attitude at the Dallas Museum of Art. The collection of world art and archaeological treasures is a delight, with plenty to keep families traveling with kids amused. Ancient wonders range from Greek, Roman and Etruscan masterpieces to wonderful bowls from the Mimbres pueblos of New Mexico and a pre-Columbian Peruvian gold mask. Look out for the Mayan flint knife in the form of a crocodile-shaped canoe with human passengers.\nThe modern (well, more recent) collection of paintings and sculptures is equally impressive. American works include Edward Hopper's enigmatic Lighthouse Hill and Frederic Church's sublime The Icebergs. A re-created villa modeled on Coco Chanel's Mediterranean mansion holds canvases by British statesman Winston Churchill. European greats are well represented, with works including Magritte's The Light of Coincidences, Mondrian's Place de la Concorde, Van Gogh's Sheaves of Wheat and multiple pieces by Picasso and Monet.  \nIt's also worth dropping into the adjacent Nasher Sculpture Center, housed in an impressive glass-and-steel building across from the Dallas Museum of Art. Partnered by a divine sculpture garden, the Renzo Piano-designed building is a work of art in its own right. Inside (accessed on a separate ticket to the Dallas Museum of Art), you can view one of the greatest private sculpture collections in the world, including works by Calder, de Kooning, Rodin, Serra and Miró, assembled by art collectors Raymond and Patsy Nasher.\n\n  \nSculpture and reflecting pool at the Dallas Museum of Art ©Shutterstock / Nate Hovee\n\nThe history of the Museum of Art\nDespite it's modern demeanor, the Dallas Museum of Art has a long, venerable history. The museum grew out of public art exhibitions held in the Dallas Public Library by the enthusiast-run Dallas Art Association. Library founder May Dickson Exall led the drive for a permanent museum space, and in the 1930s, the museum moved into its first fixed location at Fair Park.\nAfter surviving a McCarthyite purge in the 1950s, when campaigners pushed for the museum to remove works by 'communist' artists such as Picasso, the museum merged with the rival Dallas Museum of Contemporary Art, creating a single space for modern and historical art in the city. As the museum's collection, and reputation, grew, so did its need for space. The present, concrete-faced premises were inaugurated in 1984.\nTickets &amp; Practicalities\nAs one of Dallas' top things to do, the museum can get busy; school groups fill the galleries on weekdays (except Mondays, when the museum is closed), and tourists do the same at weekends. Admission is free but you may need to book a ticket for entry (easy to do online). There are charges for some temporary exhibitions – see the website for details of paid-for events.\n"

Tasked with creating a bigger space for the state government after it outgrew the original capitol building, architect Elijah E. Myers submitted his design in 1881. It was his second time designing such an edifice after making a name for himself on the Michigan State Capitol Building in Detroit. However, the building that stands today reflects some changes to Myers design made after he was fired from the project in 1886.\nThe Capitol narrowly survived a 1983 fire, resulting in numerous renovations and restorations over the next decade. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and designated a National Historic Landmark in 1986. Drop in even if only to take a peek at the historic portraiture and the lovely rotunda – look up at the dome – and try out the whispering gallery created by its curved ceiling.\n\n  \nThe centerpiece of the State Capitol dome is a lone star surrounded by the letters TEXAS ©Sky Noir Photography by Bill Dickinson/Getty Images\n\nThe green sprawl of the capitol grounds and its monuments (which controversially still include a number of Confederate tributes) are worth a stroll.

Take a seat in the 3rd-floor visitors balconies overlooking the House of Representatives and Senate chamber galleries, which are open to the public when the state legislature is in session (odd-numbered years from mid-January through May or June).\nThere’s free two-hour parking in the Capitol Visitors Parking Garage, entered from either 12th St or 13th St, off San Jacinto Blvd.\n"

Every year up to 1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats make their home upon a platform beneath the Congress Ave Bridge, which crosses the Colorado at the southern end of downtown.\nNorth America’s largest urban bat colony consists entirely of female and young animals. In June, each female gives birth to one pup, and such is the density as the families take to the skies that bat radars have detected bat columns up to 10,000 feet (3050m) high. Each night, they feed on an estimated 30,000lb (13,500kg) of insects as the colony emerges toward the east like a fast-moving, black, chittering river.\n\n  \nAerial of Austin Texas from the Congress Avenue Bridge, next to the Statesmans Bat Observation Center. ©Christian Hinkle/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nHow to see Austin's bats\nThe Austin American-Statesman’s Bat Observation Area on the southeast side of Congress Avenue is accessible for visitors with disabilities, and is free to enjoy. You will, however, have to pay for parking nearby. The Bat Observation Area includes educational kiosks that operate year round, and Bat Conservation International has volunteers on hand and holds programs on weekend evenings during prime bat-viewing season from May through September. The best bat viewing is in August. You can also call the city's Bat Hotline at (512) 327-9721 to get the most up-to-date information on when the bats have been making their nightly appearances. \nIn addition to using the Bat Observation Area, people also line up on the narrow sidewalks of the bridge itself, as well as on the grassy hills around the base of the bridge. Lone Star Riverboats and Capital Cruises, behind the Hyatt Hotel, offer bat-watching excursions that run $12 for adults and $7 for kids. Capital also offers guided kayak tours for $30. If you have your own SUP or kayak, you can put in at a number of different points along Ladybird Lake, whether you want to start close to the bridge or a little further away like at Zilker Park.\n"

        "detail_description": "Commissioned by Dominique and John de Menil (also founders of the Menil Collection) in 1964 to create a nondenominational chapel, American abstract expressionist Mark Rothko (1903–70) devoted the final years of his life to the project. The octagonal brick structure now holds 14 large Rothko canvases. The architects of the building were Philip Johnson, Howard Barnstone, and Eugene Aubry.\nThe Menils wanted to give a great artist the opportunity to create a spiritual place without any restrictions or ties to existing religions. The chapel receives over 100,000 visitors a year and is the home of the Óscar Romero Award – a biennial award that recognises courageous advocates of human rights. It's named after Archbishop Óscar Romero who was murdered in 1980 after continually speaking out against injustice in his home country of El Salvador. \n\n  \nExterior gardens and sculpture of the Rothko Chapel in the Museum District of Houston. © Christi Vest/500px\n\nWhy are there paintings inside the chapel?\nAt first glance the paintings seem an almost uniform black. The longer you spend in this supremely meditative space, however, the more subtleties appear, and just as Rothko intended, many visitors experience a profoundly emotional reaction. Rothko wanted visitors to have a calm, contemplative, spiritual experience by creating a space that didn't overload the senses, but rather encouraged quiet reflection and introspection.\nExternal sculpture\nBarnett Newman's sculpture 'Broken Obelisk' is located outside the chapel and the de Menils dedicated it to the memory and work of The Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The dramatic sculpture looms above a reflecting pool in the grounds of the Rothko Chapel. The sculpture was originally financed by the de Menils and the city of Houston and was intended to sit outside City Hall. However, when the city of Houston refused to dedicate the sculpture to the recently assassinated Dr King as agreed, the de Menils bought it outright and placed it in its current location with the intended dedication intact.\nHow much is it?\nThe chapel and its grounds are free to enter and are open from dawn until dusk. The chapel and the Welcome House are closed on Mondays.\nCan you get married there?\nPrivate services, including weddings, are available to book within the chapel for a fee. The chapel itself is nondenominational but has hosted weddings, bar mitzvahs, baptisms, memorials and other major life events in the past. Photography and video is not permitted within the chapel but is permitted in the grounds.\n"

Representative pieces span the ages, from Ice Age carvings, via Cycladic figures from 2800 BCE and Benin bronzes, to more recent works by Pablo Picasso, Francis Bacon, Andy Warhol and Kara Walker.\nWho owns the Menil Collection?\nAs the name suggests, the Menil Collection is rooted in the extraordinary array of art and archaeological artifacts amassed by Houstonians John and Dominique de Menil. The gallery&nbsp;was opened to the public in 1987 but it doesn't house the entire collection. The collection consists of over 17,000 works of art and pieces are curated and rotated regularly. A non-profit charitable foundation has managed the collection since the death of Dominique de Menil in 1997.\nThe single gallery in the Menil Drawing Institute, alongside, hosts changing exhibitions devoted to big-name artists. Be sure you also visit the Cy Twombly Gallery and the serene and meditative Rothko Chapel, annexes of the collection.\nHow much does it cost?\nThe collection is free to all, you just need to book an appointment online for a scheduled visit. The Menil&nbsp;Foundation has stated that the collection will always remain free of charge to the public.\n"

        "detail_description": "Known in its time as the Queen of the Missions, San José is certainly the largest and arguably the most beautiful of all the sites on the Mission Trail. Because it's a little more remote and pastoral, surrounded by thick stone walls, you can really get a sense of what life was like here in the 18th and 19th centuries. It's also the location of the main visitor center for San Antonio Missions National Historical Park, which oversees the city's four mission sites.\nHistory of the missions\nThe San Antonio missions were constructed in the early 18th century as part of an effort to provide way-stations and staging areas for Spanish colonial expansion to the north. The native Coahuiltecans, already under pressure from other nomadic Native American tribes pushing down from the north, showed a willingness to convert to Christianity, and labored for the colonial Spanish priests in order to receive food and protection at the missions.\nConstructed in what is now downtown, the first and most impressive mission was what would come to be known as the Alamo. With the destruction by war or disease of many East Texas missions, the Spanish quickly built four more missions south of the Alamo, now collectively known as the Mission Trail. Religious services are still held in the mission churches.\n\n  \nRangers can talk you through details of the building and surrounding landscape © traveler1116 / Getty Images\n\nTours of Mission San José\nAdmission to all four San Antonio missions is free. Free ranger-led tours start from the visitor center at 11am each day and last around 45 minutes. There are also ranger talks each afternoon, which cover the history of the Mission, and look at the architecture, church carvings and surrounding landscape. \nServices at Mission San José\nMass at Mission San José is conducted in English and Spanish. Check with the church directly for information on services. \nHow to get there\nMission San José is the second mission as you head south from downtown. To get to the mission from downtown, take VIA transit bus 42, which connects to San José. To drive from downtown, take St Marys Street south until it becomes Mission Road, then follow the brown signs indicating the direction to the missions.\nThe new Mission Reach, an 8-mile extension of the River Walk, connects downtown with all four missions. South of the Blue Star Arts Complex, the River Walk becomes a pretty walking and cycling trail, open from dawn to dusk.\n"

His act of raising a flag of \"no quarter\", meaning he would take no prisoners, began the deadly siege.\nOn little evidence beyond the fact that they bore fragments of uniforms – and even though the Alamo defenders didn't wear uniforms – charred bones unearthed near the altar in 1936 were claimed to be those of Davy Crockett, William Travis and James Bowie.

Otherwise, a single-day ticket to Sea World is $68 while a separate single-day ticket to Aquatica is $49 (they're a bit cheaper if you buy three days in advance online).
