        "detail_description": "Borrowing from western urban-regeneration models, this early-20th-century wine factory has been restored as Taipei's most retro-chic venue. Remodelled warehouses now hold live-music performances and pop-up shops sell innovative Taiwanese-designed products, there are ever-changing exhibitions, and a host of stylish restaurants, cafes and bars will have you loving the ambience as much as the food. Many of the exhibitions are aimed at children and take over the giant spaces. Don't forget SPOT around the back, Taipei's best independent cinema.\nThe factory opened in 1916 as a private wine-making facility, and was finally shuttered in 1987. The area would likely be just another block of overpriced city apartments today if not for arts groups. In 1997, they discovered that the old factory provided a perfect venue for performances, workshops and installations – the warehouses are spacious, have high ceilings and are flooded with natural light.In 2003, after years of pressure, the city gave management of Huashan to the Council for Cultural Affairs. After a multiyear restoration, Huashan emerged as a popular gathering spot for families and hipsters alike, a source of urban pride, and a venue for both the promotion and dissemination of new ideas about both art and urban living.Hours for individual shops, restaurants and performance venues vary. There's an information centre near the front as you face the grounds off Bade Rd."

        "detail_description": "This grandiose monument to authoritarian leader Chiang Kai-shek is a popular attraction and rightly so. It is a sobering feeling to stand in the massive courtyard. Chiang's blue-roofed hall is a prime example of the neoclassical style, favoured by CKS as a counterpoint to the Cultural Revolution's destruction of genuine classical culture in China. Note the main hall shuts at 6pm, but the surrounding park is open 5am to midnight.\nEntrance to the main hall is made via a series of 89 steps (Chiang's age when he died). Inside the cavernous hall is an artefact museum with Chiang's two Cadillacs, various documents and articles from daily life. The hourly changing of the honour guard is probably the most popular sight with most visitors. The flag raising at dawn and lowering at dusk is also conducted with pomp and is popular with local tourists.Some eclectic and very excellent exhibitions are held in two halls next to Chiang's, which are generally ticketed. Some past shows include art by Andy Warhol, pieces from the British Museum and sketches from Japan's Studio Ghibli (of Spirited Away fame).In 2007, the square in front of the hall was renamed 'Liberty Square' in honour of Taiwan's long road to democracy, and for a time it was conceivable that the memorial itself would also be renamed and the Chiang sculpture removed. That didn't happen, and the reasons (which will vary depending on who you ask) pretty much summarise where modern Taiwan is at, both politically and socially. The debate rages on."

        "detail_description": "This former 'Centre Street' has long been known for its Chinese medicine shops, fabric market and lively Lunar New Year sundry market. It has attracted numerous restoration and cultural projects and is now a magnet for young entrepreneurs, eager to breathe new life into the neighbourhood with cafes, restaurants, art studios and antique shops.Thankfully, this gentrification hasn't squashed the original atmosphere – fancy ceramic shops sit side by side with long-term tenants selling sacks of dried mushrooms and agricultural produce.\nDíhuà Jiē was constructed in the 1850s. Merchants from the Wanhua area were on the losing side of an ethnic feud (over different groups' ancestor origins – all too common in Taiwan's history), and fled to Dadaocheng (now a neighbourhood inside Datong). The merchants prospered here while the Wanhua port, further downstream, eventually silted up. Some might say they got their revenge.After Taiwan's ports were opened following the Second Opium War (1856–60), western tea merchants flooded into the area and built handsome mansions and trading stores. Later, during the Japanese era, baroque and modernist architectural and decorative touches were added to many shops, making Dihua Taipei's most historically diverse street. The first house/shop on the street is at 156 Dihua St, Sec 1. Notice its low profile and narrow arcades. Further up the street, near Mingquan W Rd, are typical shops from the late 19th century with arched windows and wide arcades. Closer to Yongle Market are the western-style merchant houses and shops renovated during Japanese times.On the 8th and 9th floors of Yongle Market is DaDaoCheng Theater, a popular venue for traditional performances.Note: the Lunar New Year bazaar here is extremely bustling and popular. If you don't like crowds, it is best to avoid this area."

        "detail_description": "Green Island's windswept northeast corner was completely out of bounds for much of the 20th century, occupied by a large prison camp. Here, political opponents of the regime were incarcerated and 're-educated' during Taiwan's White Terror and Martial Law periods (1949–87). Most of the watchtowers and chillingly banal buildings still stand, now forming a sprawling memorial museum. It's well worth a visit, but pick up the free explanatory leaflets as little else is in English.\nDirectly east of Gongguan harbour, the first related site is a beautifully manicured lawn containing an excavated trench in which is the National Human Rights Monument. Fronted by photogenic, wave-lashed rocky spires, views from the park are memorable. Around 200m beyond, the most obviously prison-like structure was sardonically referred to as Oasis Villa (綠洲山莊; Shānzhuāng). Here you can peep into the forlorn, mostly featureless jail cells. However, rather more interesting (if less visited, 300m further east), is the New Life re-education camp, where two of the timber-walled halls demonstrate living conditions of the time using waxwork mannequins.If you continue 800m further along the coast, the road soon degenerates into a rough stoney track, passing razor-wired old walls and a 'water torture' pillbox before dead-ending at a lonely little graveyard for some of the '13th Squadron' (ie the prisoners who succumbed). It's a sombre but scenically memorable spot. Walk another 400m along the beach past scuttling crabs, then climb a short rise to reach a large cave full of swooping swallows. This was once used as theatre in which inmates rehearsed and performed re-education plays to demonstrate their new-found faith in the regime. Some say it was also used as an execution ground and mortuary, and consider it haunted."

This exquisite structure is loaded with prime examples of the traditional decorative arts, and the yearly folk arts festival (April to June) is a showcase of traditional performance arts.\nThe temple was founded in 1760 by immigrants from Xiamen, Fujian province, and its modern size and design began to take shape in 1805. The main resident god is Emperor Baosheng (or Wu), a historical figure revered for his medical skills. The rear shrine is dedicated to Shennong, the god of agriculture.From 1995 to 2002, the temple underwent its largest renovation project ever. Under sound management, skilled artisans were employed and top-quality materials used. In addition, the temple began holding an annual folk-arts festival (called Baosheng Cultural Festival), which includes the Five Day Completion Rituals to Thank Gods (essentially to transform the temple from an everyday to a sacred space), the gods' birthday celebrations, lion dances, parades, Taiwanese opera performances and even free Chinese-medicine clinics. See the temple's website for dates of events, all of which are free.There’s an information office, with a brochure on Bao’an and a small selection of English-language books, at the rear of the temple’s inner courtyard."

A temple took them in, after trying in vain to negotiate with the labour authorities. In return for free food and lodging, the men were asked to build a temple, which they did in the early 1990s with seashells, corals, stones and loads of imagination.\nTianliao Stone Temple worships a number of Taoist gods, but the main deity here is the Cundi Bodhisattva (準提菩薩). You'll see her and a plethora of other gold-faced Taoist deities lined up along colonnaded corridors.The temple puts out a delicious vegetarian buffet daily for devotees. Make a donation, grab a bowl and chopsticks, and join in.Take bus 8013 from Gangshan (崗山) to Tianliao (田寮) and get off 30 minutes later at the 20th stop, Niulu Wan (牛路灣), which is the road outside the temple compound. There are only three buses a day, departing from Gangshan at 5.40am (7.35am on weekends and holidays), 11.05am and 5.20pm. Buses leave Tianliao daily at 6.15am (8.20am on weekends and public holidays), 11.50am and 6.05pm.You could also consider taking a cab from Kaohsiung (40 minutes, one-way NT$700-800). It's best to negotiate with the driver to wait for you while you explore, as there are no taxis at the temple and few will drive out to pick you up.The temple is also known as Cíxuán Shèngtiān Gōng (慈玄聖天宮)."

Eventually the family settled in what is now Banqiao city, building this mansion and its expansive gardens in the mid-19th century. Today both are the largest remaining examples from that period left in Taiwan. Beautiful carvings and traditional motifs abound: in particular look out for the windows shaped like butterflies, bats, coins, peaches and fans. The garden is designed in the southern-Chinese style with abundant viewpoints created in the limited space by narrow maze-like walkways.Of all the restored residences in Taipei and New Taipei, this is by far the most worthwhile to visit.

Using mechanised animatronic dioramas and eerie lighting, the house features scenes from a Buddhist hell that show sinners being fried and disembowelled. This quirky religious kitsch from the '70s is more fun than scary by today's standards.\nOn the 3rd floor is a temple dedicated to the Monkey King that looks like it belongs to a '70s period movie, like those by director Li Han-hsiang. The top floor houses a new section of the haunted house that's darker, louder and more theme-park-like, but less interesting than the first one.Look for the green sign that says Nantian Temple (南天宮) directly opposite Baguashan's main entrance. Follow the narrow path downhill. The path is clearly signposted and you'll see advertisements, in Mandarin, for '18 levels of Hell fully mechanised' or 'No expense spared in recreating the 18 levels of Hell'.

        "detail_description": "Jinguashi's big draw is this Japanese-era mining-complex-turned-tourist-park, where hillside paths connect 1930s offices, workshops and dormitories, and you can fondle reputedly the world's largest gold bar at the Gold Museum. The Beishan Fifth Tunnel (extra NT$50, to 4.30pm) offers a walk-through glimpse of working conditions in the old mine, while high above the park, the ruins of a Japanese shinto shrine appear like something out of Greek mythology. The bus from Jiufen stops beside the ticket office.\nThe Crown Prince Chalet (太子賓館; Tàizǐ Bīngguǎn), a Japanese-style garden mansion with sweeping sea views, is another draw, though unfortunately you can only wander the gardens and peek through the windows. It was built in 1922 by the mining company to allegedly house the Japanese crown prince (the future Emperor Hirohito) on an inspection tour. He never came, and later the chalet became a hotel for high-ranking Kuomintang officials.It may be interesting to note as you walk around that not all the gold in this area has been collected. Even today there remains a 250-tonne reserve estimated at more than NT$200 billion (US$6 billion) lying underground."

If Fort San Domingo was meant to convey authority, Hobe Fort was built for military action.\nThis prime heritage spot (it has suffered almost no reconstruction) has thick earthen walls, massive gates, four batteries and steep steps to its ramparts to deter intruders. While it was used by the Japanese as a base for artillery firing practice, the fort never saw any military action.The admission fee includes entry to Fort San Domingo and the Customs Officer's Residence. The fort is closed on the first Monday of the month."

Nonchalant words in a wild and formidable script that may evoke fear, unease, relief or joy, depending on how you've lived your life.\nThe City God (Chenghuang), officially the protector of towns, also tallies this life's good and bad deeds after we die. It is therefore not unusual that his image appears in the last chamber of Dongyue Temple, which is dedicated to the underworld, nor that these two temples sit near each other.In the worship hall, look for pink slips of paper on the altar. They're from students asking for help to pass an exam. Yep, school is hell everywhere."

        "detail_description": "A remarkable museum in a unique location. From the '50s to the '70s this white building was a hostel for young men departing for compulsory military service on the islands. Now this site of tears and goodbyes houses strong contemporary art from Taiwan and overseas. We saw photography by Taiwanese Juan I-jong, works playing with light and space by American James Turrell; installations by two Hong Kong artists; and abstract jewellery designed by a German.\nThe museum's Mandarin name 'Jinma Binguan' translates as Kinma Hostel; 'Kinma' being an elision of 'Kinmen' and 'Matsu', the islands where the young men were stationed. There is a display on the building's unusual history, which explains and documents this once-transitional space with old photographs and the oral histories of veterans.The museum is a five-minute walk from Shoushan Light Rail Station."

        "detail_description": "A true hidden gem, this private museum has a small but exceptional collection of sculpture and antiques by mid-19th- to 20th-century Japanese artists who were inspired by Taiwan or who had taught early Taiwanese masters. There's mind-blowing jizai okimono (articulated animal figures), such as iron snakes that move like real ones and a metallic pheasant comprising 700 parts; netsuke (small carved ornaments) of outstanding artistry; and beautiful paintings and vases. Most are unique or one of under a handful ever made.\nTo visit make contact via Facebook messaging or by calling English-speaking owner Mr Guo, a month in advance. There needs to be at least eight of you to visit, but he can also let you join other visitors. Mr Guo is an excellent guide. The museum is located in a commercial building called 50樓 (50 Building)."

        "detail_description": "Head down to the river from the Museum of Drinking Water, turn left, and you'll soon come across this charming art village. It was founded in the late 1940s by soldiers who fled to Taiwan with Chiang Kai-shek. It was praised for its 'living memories' and off-the-grid community lifestyle – villagers 'borrowed' electricity, set up organic farms by the river, built homes out of discarded materials and recycled grey water. However, the village underwent a makeover in 2010 and is now largely an artist village.\nIt's a photogenic place, and very dreamy to explore at night; architects, activists and artists are likely to find it both fascinating and inspiring. There's always some kind of arty event happening here from exhibitions to light shows to outdoor movie screenings. Check the website to see what's on."
