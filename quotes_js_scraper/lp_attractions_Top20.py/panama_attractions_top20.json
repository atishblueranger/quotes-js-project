        "detail_description": "Founded on August 15, 1519, by Spanish conquistador Pedro Arias de Ávila, the city of Panamá was the first European settlement along the Pacific. For 150 years it flourished as Spain exported Peruvian gold and silver to Europe via Panamá. In 1671, Captain Henry Morgan sacked the city and it was relocated to the present-day Casco Viejo. Today much of Panamá Viejo lies buried under a poor residential neighborhood, though the ruins are a must-see.\nThe center of power resided at the Casas Reales, a complex ringed by timber ramparts and separated from the city proper by a moat. Within the complex were the customs house, the royal treasury, a prison and the governor's house. Despite the obvious historical importance of the site, past governments have allowed sections of the property to be used as a landfill and for horse stables. Only scattered walls remain of the once-impressive structures.The Catedral de Nuestra Señora de la Asunción, built between 1619 and 1626, is the best-preserved building of the ruins. In traditional fashion, it was designed so that its two side chapels gave the cathedral a cross-like shape as viewed from the heavens. The bell tower was at the back of the church and may have served double duty as a watchtower for the Casas Reales. The main facade, which faced the Plaza Mayor (Grand Plaza), is gone – only the walls remain.Also facing the Plaza Mayor were the Cabildo de la Ciudad and the Casas de Terrín, houses built by one of the city's wealthiest citizens, Francisco Terrín.Immediately north of the cathedral are the massive ruins of Casa Alarcón, the town's best-preserved and largest known private residence, which dates from the 1640s. Just north of the former residence is the Iglesia y Convento de Santo Domingo, the best-preserved church of the ruins. The convent dates from the 1570s; the church was built 20 or more years later.Arriving a decade or so after the Dominican friars were the Jesuits, who built the Iglesia y Convento de la Compañía de Jesús, whose stone ruins are likewise visible today. Just west of the Jesuits' facilities are the spacious ruins of a church and convent, the Iglesia y Convento de la Concepción, which were erected by the nuns of Nuestra Señora de la Concepción (Our Lady of the Conception). Most of the ruins, which cover the better part of two blocks, were part of the church – little remains of the convent.Between the nuns' church and the sea was the city's sole hospital, the Hospital de San Juan de Dios. Unfortunately, much of the hospital's remains were scattered when Av Cincuentenario and a side road were put in. Also bordering the avenue, two blocks west of the hospital's ruins, are the remains of the Iglesia y Convento de San Francisco, the facilities erected by the Franciscans. The church faced the sea and stood on a massive base.Continuing two blocks west along Av Cincuentenario, you'll arrive at the ruins of the Iglesia y Convento de La Merced. Erected by Mercedarian friars in the early 17th century, the buildings survived the fire that swept the city following Morgan's assault. However, the church's facade is missing because the friars dismantled it and moved it to Casco Viejo, where it can be seen today.Further west and paralleling the modern bridge is the Puente del Matadero, a horribly over-restored stone bridge that took its name from a nearby slaughterhouse, and marked the beginning of the Camino Real to Portobelo. A much more significant bridge is the Puente del Rey, which is visible from Av Cincuentenario near the northern edge of town. Built in 1617, it may be the oldest standing bridge in the Americas.About halfway between Puente del Rey and the Iglesia y Convento de Santo Domingo lies the Iglesia de San José, which belonged to the Augustine order. Marking this building as special were its vaulted side chapels, an architectural feature seldom seen in Panama.Enter via the entrance furthest west to access the visitor center and museum. The terrain is extensive and best suited to able walkers. Golf cart tours are sporadically offered when there are enough guests to fill the cart."

Otherwise take a Paraíso or Gamboa bus from the terminal. These pass along the canal-side highway to Gamboa and will let you off at the ‘Miraflores Locks’ sign (US$0.35) on the highway, 12km from the city center. It’s about a 15-minute walk along the main road to the locks from the sign. You can also take a taxi; drivers will typically wait 30 minutes at the locks and then drive you back to the capital. Expect to pay no more than US$30 round trip, but agree on the price beforehand."

        "detail_description": "On a hill north of downtown, this 265-hectare park protects vast expanses of tropical semideciduous forest within the city limits, and serves as an incredible wilderness escape from the trappings of the capital. Two main walking trails, the Nature Trail and the Tití Monkey Trail, join to form one long loop. On the loop, a 150m-high mirador (lookout) offers panoramic views of Panama City, the bay and the canal all the way to the Miraflores Locks.\nMammals in the park include tití monkeys, anteaters, sloths and white-tailed deer, while reptiles include iguanas, turtles and tortoises. More than 250 bird species have been spotted here, and there are fish and shrimp living in the Río Curundú, which runs along the eastern side of the park.The park was the site of an important battle during the US invasion to oust Manuel Noriega. Also of historical significance are the concrete structures just past the park entrance, which were used during WWII as a testing and assembly plant for aircraft engines.The park is bordered on its western and northern sides by Camino de la Amistad and to the south and east by Corredor Norte; Av Juan Pablo II runs right through the park. Pick up a pamphlet for a self-guided tour in Spanish and English at the visitors center, 40m north of the park entrance. Rangers offer one-hour tours to groups of five or more (around US$6 per person), but you need to call in advance.An international team of scientists from the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI) have set up a crane in the park to study the forest canopy, which is home to a complete ecosystem 30m to 50m up from the ground. Although the crane was previously off-limits to the public, Ancon Expeditions was awarded permission to take tourists up to the treetops. This is a highly recommended experience that will provide you with an entirely different view of the rainforest, though you will need to book in advance as only a limited number of tourists is allowed up on the crane each day."

        "detail_description": "Some 26km northwest of central Chitré, Parque Nacional Sarigua is arguably the most important pre-Columbian site in Panama. The archaeological site has been dated back 11,000 years, although much of it is yet to be excavated. Created in 1984, it consists of 80 sq km of wasteland that was once dry tropical rainforest and coastal mangrove patches. Buses do not go all the way to the park. A taxi ride to the park office from Chitré costs about US$15.\nSarigua is the end product of slash-and-burn agriculture so typical of the Península de Azuero; because the forest that had held the thin topsoil in place was removed, the heavy rainfalls that occur each year have carried the topsoil away.A visit to Sarigua is a sobering reminder of the earth’s fragility, and the rapid speed in which humans can alter the environment. From the rickety mirador (lookout) behind the ranger station, you can gaze out at the dry, cracked earth and swirling dust storms that used to be a living, breathing ecosystem. If you have your own transportation (4WD required in rainy season), you can drive a few kilometers into the park, but much of Sarigua is off-limits to the public. The coastal edges of the park are also home to privately owned commercial shrimp farms, which stand as a testament to the rapid destruction of Panama’s wetland habitat.To get here from the Carretera Nacional, take the turnoff opposite the unmissable (and bright orange) Super Candy convenience store just before you reach Parita. After going 2.5km, you'll reach a fork with a green-and-yellow sign indicating the park. The ranger's station is another five minutes further on."

Even if the big bird proves elusive, there's a good chance of seeing everything from three-toed sloths and capybaras, the world's largest rodents, to jaguars.\nIn the waterways, you'll almost certainly see brown pelicans, magnificent frigate birds and laughing gulls; bottlenose dolphins and humpback whales also frequent these parts. Other birds to keep an eye out for include terns, American oystercatchers and waders.In the mangroves, you'll have a good chance of spotting Amazon kingfishers, white ibises and herons, as well as waders such as willets, whimbrels and spotted sandpipers. A specialty of the area is the black oropendola, which has a higher than normal frequency near Mogué. Late afternoon and early morning are good times to look for crab-eating raccoons venturing down to the water's edge.A swampy flat near the ANCON lodge supports large numbers of capybaras, though a little luck is needed to spot them. This community of giant rodents attracts crocodiles and the elusive jaguar. Commonly spotted mammals include grey foxes around the lodge (especially at night) and tayras in patches of nearby dry forest."

        "detail_description": "One of the joys of visiting Bocas is touring the 'Monkey Farm' botanical garden a couple of kilometers northwest of the center. Painstakingly carved out of 10 hectares of secondary rainforest over almost two decades, it contains hundreds of species of local and imported trees and ornamental plants, and is teeming with wildlife.\nCo-owner and guide Lin Gillingham will point out howler and white-faced capuchin monkeys, sloths and various bird species. Tours, on Fridays and Mondays, must be booked in advance; garden tours depart regularly while birding tours are on demand."

        "detail_description": "This 776-hectare refuge about 25km north of Chitré protects a mangrove forest at the mouth of the Río Santa María. It's an important wildlife area and nesting ground for wading birds. The most commonly sighted species are great egrets, cattle egrets and tricolored herons. The refuge is a 45-minute drive north of Chitré via the Carretera Nacional, easily accessible as a day trip.\nThe refuge is accessed by a 500m-loop trail that follows a boardwalk through the mangrove forest. Along the way, keep your eyes fixed on the waters below, as the abundance of wading birds also attracts hungry caimans and crocodiles. The herons are here year-round, and opportunistic reptiles tend to congregate during the June-to-September nesting season.Many of the herons that now inhabit the Palacio de las Garzas (Palace of the Herons), the official residence of the Panamanian president in Casco Viejo, Panama City, hail from this reserve.The refuge is also home to La Cueva del Tigre (The Tiger's Cave), an archaeological site dating back some 12,000 years.To get here, take the signposted turnoff to the village of Paris. After 1km the road forks at a church; take the right branch and it becomes a dirt road. Proceed 4km on this road, after which you’ll come to a sign with an arrow indicating you’re 2km from the entrance to the refuge. Expect to pay US$25 for a taxi from Chitré and US$15 from Parita."
