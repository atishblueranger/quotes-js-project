        "detail_description": "Shaped like a cartoon lightning bolt, Lake Wakatipu is NZ's third-largest lake. It reaches a depth of 372m, meaning the lake bed actually sits below sea level. Five rivers flow into it but only one (the Kawarau) flows out, making it prone to sometimes dramatic floods. The lake can be experienced at any number of speeds: the classic TSS Earnslaw steamboat trip, a spin with KJet, below decks in the Time Tripper, or a shark's-eye view with Hydro Attack.\nIf the water looks clean, that's because it is. Scientists have rated it as 99.9% pure – you're better off dipping your glass in the lake than buying bottled water. It's also very cold. That beach by Marine Pde may look tempting on a scorching day, but trust us – you won't want to splash about for long in water that hovers around 11.5°C year-round. Because cold water increases the risk of drowning, local by-laws require the wearing of life jackets in all boats under 6m, including kayaks, on the lake (and all of the district's lakes).Māori tradition sees the lake's shape as the burnt outline of the evil giant Matau sleeping with his knees drawn up. Local lad Matakauri set fire to the bed of bracken on which the giant slept in order to rescue his beloved Manata, a chief's daughter who was kidnapped by the giant. The fat from Matau's body created a fire so intense that it burnt a hole deep into the ground."

Walking tracks run along both banks.\nWalk\nThe Huka Falls Walkway heads back towards town and the Spa Thermal Park, while the Huka Falls to Aratiatia Rapids track goes 7km downstream to the rapids. On sunny days the water is crystal clear and you can take great photographs from the lookout on the other side of the footbridge.\nJet boats\nThere are multiple ways to see the falls on a tour.&nbsp;An adenaline-pumping&nbsp;jet-boat tour will take you to the base of Huka Falls where you’ll feel the spray on your face. For a more relaxed&nbsp;experience, book a Huka Falls river cruise for a cup of tea with your views. Alternatively, take a helicopter tour of the Taupo region and get a birds-eye view of this spectacular natural phenomenon instead.&nbsp;\nHuka Falls deaths&nbsp;\nThis is a treacherous body of water with a very high-pressure and extremely dangerous waterfall. There have unfortunately been a number of drownings here over the years, so locals stress that it is a tourist attraction for viewing only. Do not enter the falls. We repeat: do not enter the falls.\n"

At the top of this volcanic cone (at 182m high) there is an obelisk and epic 360-degree views of Auckland and its harbours.&nbsp;\nIt is&nbsp;also the site of the grave of John Logan Campbell (the ‘father of Auckland’) who gifted the 230-hectare area to the city in 1901. He also requested that a memorial be built to the dispossessed Māori people at the summit.&nbsp;\nThe 'one tree' cut down\nToday there is only a&nbsp;stump of the last ‘one tree’.&nbsp;The original tōtara tree was cut down in 1852 by a Pākehā (white) settler, either because it was significant to the Māori people or because he needed firewood – depending on which account you believe.&nbsp;\nIn response, John Logan Campbell planted a stand of Monterey pines of which only one lone tree survived. That tree was felled in a chainsaw attack in 2000 by a Māori activist who wanted to raise awareness of the government's fiscal envelope policy&nbsp;– a target to settle all historic Treaty claims for NZ$1 billion – on the anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.\nIn 2015 new native trees were planted on the site, with a view to one day having a single pohutukawa or tōtara.&nbsp;\nWalk&nbsp;\nAs well as visiting the summit, allow time to explore the surrounding Cornwall Park with its mature trees and historic Acacia Cottage (1841). The Cornwall Park Information Centre has fascinating interactive displays illustrating what the pā would have looked like when 5000 people lived here.&nbsp;\nNear the excellent children’s playground, the Stardome offers regular stargazing and planetarium shows (usually 7pm and 8pm Wednesday to Sunday, with extra shows on weekends) that aren’t dependent on Auckland’s fickle weather.\nHistory\nThe Māori name Maungakiekie means the mountain where kiekie (a native vine) grows abundantly. The mountain and its surrounds were home to the Te Wai ō Hua iwi (tribe) although other iwi also trace their ancestry to the mountain.\nOne Tree Hill and U2&nbsp;\nYes, that U2 song from the 1987 album Joshua Tree is about this place too. It was dedicated to the memory of a New Zealander, Greg Carroll, who Bono became friends with after they met in Auckland in 1984. Carroll&nbsp;joined the group as a roadie, moving to Dublin with the band after touring with them in New Zealand, Australia and the US. He was killed in a motorcycle accident in Dublin. The song is referring to the first night in Auckland when he took Bono to One Tree Hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;\nPlanning your visit\nTo get to One Tree Hill from the city, take a train to Greenlane and walk 1km along Green Lane West. By car, take the Greenlane exit off the Southern Motorway and turn right into Green Lane West.\n&nbsp;\n"

Waimangu (Black Water) refers to the dark water that once shot out of the world's mightiest geyser, reaching heights of up to 400m during its eruptions from 1900 to 1904.Waimangu is 25 minutes' drive south of Rotorua, 6km off SH5 (towards Taupō) at a marked turn-off."

Walk through a re-created passenger-ship cabin (you can try out a bunk) and check out the fascinating array of obsolete technology.\n"

As your eyes grow accustomed to the dark you’ll see a Milky Way of little lights surrounding you – these are the glowworms. Book your tour at the visitor centre.\nThe acoustics are so good that Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and the Vienna Boys Choir have given concerts here."

If you’ve got wheels, take Oriental Pde along the waterfront and then scoot up Carlton Gore Rd. Aside from the views there are some interesting info panels to ogle.\n"
