The paths that wind around the lake are usually well used by those on foot and wheels of every variety, and make for some of the best people- (and dog-) watching in the city.\nIn the early 1900s, city planners lowered the lake’s water level by 7ft, increasing the shoreline to preserve parkland around the lake. After the lowering, however, Ravenna Creek, which once fed the lake, no longer flowed through. Green Lake became stagnant and filled with stinky green algae. Massive dredging efforts to keep it navigable continue, although the lake remains prone to algae blooms."

This is one of Seattle's top stops for kids, and one of the top sights in the city.\n\n  \nThe Museum of flight is the the largest private air and space museum in the world ©Elena_Suvorova / Shutterstock\n\nTaking off at the Museum of Flight\nIt shouldn't be entirely surprising to find such an impressive aviation museum in Seattle – this is, after all, the home of Boeing, founded here by William E Boeing in 1916. Get ready for an exciting jet-propelled journey through war, peace, space rockets and inspired engineering. The story of how we got from the Wright Brothers to the first moon landing in less than 66 years is powerfully told using film, photos, audio, words, flight simulators, and of course, a wonderful collection of flying machines.\nAircraft large and small are crammed into the museum's hangars, from a ginormous Boeing 747 and a decommissioned Concorde to the tiny Caproni Ca 20, the first ever fighter plane, built during WWI. You can get within touching distance of a Lockheed Model 10-E Electra, the same model plane that Emelia Earhart was flying when she vanished over the Pacific, and walk through the Boeing VC-137B that was the first presidential jet to use the call sign 'Air Force One'.\nSome aircraft are originals, some are reproductions – including most of the exhibits from the space age – but they all contribute to an evocative journey through the history of man's quest to take to the air. Look out for such oddities as Paul MacCready's Gossamer Albatross, which crossed the English Channel by pedal power in 1979, and Aerocar International's Aerocar, designed for both the airways and the highway.\nPlenty of displays cover the work of William E Boeing, the former lumber mogul who founded the Boeing aircraft company, transforming the world of travel, and the city of Seattle, in the process. The hangar known as the Red Barn was Boeing's original production facility, producing wood-framed, fabric covered aircraft in the first half of the 20th century.\n\n  \nThe Seattle Museum of Flight covers everything from fighter jets to helicopters ©Norman Ong / Shutterstock\n\nTickets &amp; Practicalities\nIt's worth buying tickets ahead of time to make sure you get in, as availability can be limited on the day, and there's heavy demand from school groups. The museum has plenty of parking, which is handy, as driving is the easiest way to reach the museum (Metro bus 124 also runs here from downtown). Pilots can also come by air – the museum has landing space for up to five light aircraft daily!\n"

Hikers can walk and scramble on either the 0.8-mile Lower Ape Cave Trail or the 1.5-mile Upper Ape Cave Trail, which requires some navigating over rock piles and through narrower passages. A Northwest Forest Pass ($30/5 per year/day) is required to park at the trailhead.\nThe trail eventually exits at the upper entrance. You can bring your own light source or rent lanterns for $5 at Apes' Headquarters, located at the entrance to the caves. In summer, rangers lead free explorations of the trails several times a day.Another interesting side trail is the 0.6-mile, wheelchair-accessible Trail of Two Forests, on a boardwalk across a 1900-year-old lava flow that once buried an ancient forest."

Park naturalists lead free interpretive hikes from the visitor center daily in summer, and snowshoe walks on winter weekends.\nThe daughter of park pioneer James Longmire unintentionally named this high-mountain nirvana when she exclaimed what a paradise it was on visiting the spot for the first time in the 1880s. Suddenly, the place had a name, and a very apt one at that. One of the snowiest places on earth, 5400ft-high Paradise remains the park's most popular draw, with its famous flower meadows backed by dramatic Rainier views on the days (a clear minority annually) when the mountain decides to take off its cloudy hat."

Boat rentals are available from Lake Quinault Lodge.A number of short hiking trails begin just below Lake Quinault Lodge; pick up a free map from the USFS office. The shortest of these is the Quinault Rain Forest Nature Trail, a half-mile walk through 500-year-old Douglas firs. This short trail adjoins the 3-mile Quinault Loop Trail, which meanders through the rainforest before circling back to the lake. The Quinault region is renowned for its huge trees. Close to the village is a 191ft Sitka spruce (purported to be up to 1000 years old), and nearby are the world's largest red cedar, Douglas fir and mountain hemlock trees.Beyond the lake, both N Shore Rd and S Shore Rd continue up the Quinault River Valley before merging at a bridge just past Bunch Falls. From here, more adventurous hikers can sally forth into the backcountry. The area's sparkling highlight is the Enchanted Valley Trail.The classic Seattle Press Expedition Hike passes through the North Fork Quinault River valley to join the lengthy Elwha River trail system further north."

To see above the lofty firs, a 53ft observation tower was erected in 1936 by the Civilian Conservation Corp.\nFor drivers, the mountain has a paved road to the summit, though the view is infinitely better if you earn it via a 4.3-mile hike up from Cascade Lake's North End Campground or a 5-mile cycle that begins just past Cascade Lake. Beginners beware: the grade is a persistent 7% with frequent hairpin turns.The park's two major bodies of water, Cascade Lake and Mountain Lake, offer campgrounds, good trout fishing, rentable paddleboats and rowboats, picnic areas and swimming beaches. The lakes are also ringed by hiking trails and linked via a pleasant wooded ramble that passes the spectacular 100ft-high Cascade Falls.Of the 38 miles of trails, about 11 are open seasonally for mountain biking.

Roughly 47,000 students and 22,000 staff enjoy the noble setting, making 'U Dub' easily the largest university in the state. The core of the campus is Central Plaza. Close by you can pick up information and a campus map at the visitor center.The university is ideal for gentle strolls, people-watching and lung-stretching exercise on the Burke-Gilman Trail. The campus also hosts two decent museums, fine sports facilities, a theater, a library, and a student-union building where leaflet-filled noticeboards advertise the kinds of outré, spontaneous events that typically color student life."

It occupies the space of an old school, which, until the 1980s, educated a large number of African American children in the Central District. After the school closed, it was occupied for a while by community activists who prevented it from being demolished. Inside, the museum's main exhibits map the story of black immigration to the Pacific Northwest, especially after WWII.\nDetails are given of some of the leading African American personalities, including George Washington Bush (the first black settler in Washington state), Manuel Lopes (Seattle's first black resident), Quincy Jones (the record producer who grew up in Seattle) and Jimi Hendrix (no introduction required). One of the prize exhibits is a hat Hendrix wore at a 1968 concert in LA. A separate room is given over to temporary exhibitions."

        "detail_description": "One of Seattle’s oldest cemeteries and the final resting place of many early settlers, Lakeview Cemetery borders Volunteer Park to the north. Arthur Denny and his family, Doc and Catherine Maynard, Thomas Mercer and Henry Yesler are all interred here. This is also the grave site of Princess Angeline, the daughter of Duwamish Chief Sealth, after whom Seattle was named. Most people, however, stop by to see the graves of martial-arts film legends Bruce and Brandon Lee.\nFlowers from fans are usually scattered around Brandon’s red and Bruce’s black tombstones, which stand side by side in a tiny part of the cemetery. The graves are not easy to find: enter the cemetery at 15th Ave E and E Garfield St; follow the road in and turn left at the Terrace Hill Mausoleum. At the crest of the hill you’ll see the large Denny family plot on your left. Look a little further along the road, and you’ll find the Lees. Even if you’re not usually into graveyards, you’ll at least enjoy the beautiful views at this one."
