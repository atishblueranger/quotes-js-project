        "detail_description": "This fascinating 1729 printing press houses an ongoing printing operation that still uses traditional woodblock printing methods and maintains more than 290,000 scripture plates, an astonishing 70% of Tibet’s literary heritage. It's the biggest and most important of three such printing presses (the others are in Lhasa and Gansu). It's more than just a mere printing house though; this is a religious and pilgrimage site, and throughout the day and early evening scores of pilgrims circumambulate the outside of the building.\nHave a look in the main hall, protected from fire and earthquakes by the guardian goddess Drölma (Tara). There are some nice murals in the two ground-floor chapels (bring a torch). Afterwards, head up the stairs on the left-hand side of the courtyard to examine the wood-block storage chambers before climbing a steep ladder up to the main attraction: pairs of printers working together to ink and press more than 2500 prints each day at lightning speed. In a side room on the same floor, you’ll find the senior printers making larger and more complex prints of Tibetan gods on paper and coloured cloth. Aside from a brief interlude during China's Cultural Revolution, these printers have been in operation continuously since the founding of the monastery in much the same atmosphere as they work in today.The wood blocks are engraved with scriptures from all of the Tibetan Buddhist orders, as well as Bön (苯教), a religion that predates the arrival of Buddhism in Tibet. These ancient writings cover astronomy, geography, music, medicine and Buddhist classics, including two of the most important Tibetan sutras. A set of 555 woodblock plates, written in Hindi, Sanskrit and Tibetan, describes the history of Indian Buddhism and is the only surviving copy in the world.On the way out, don't miss the steep ladder that gives access to the paper-cutting rooms upstairs and a small rooftop shrine beyond.You aren’t generally allowed to take photos inside.To get here, turn right out of the bus station, then left over the bridge and keep walking straight up the hill."

        "detail_description": "Le Shan’s serene, 1200-year-old Grand Buddha sits in repose, carved from a cliff face overlooking the confluence of three busy rivers: the Dadu, Min and Qingyi. The Buddhist monk Haitong conceived the project in AD 713, hoping that Buddha would protect the boats and calm the lethal currents.\nIt was 90 years after Haitong's death that the project was completed, but afterwards the river waters obeyed. Believers credited Buddha’s grace; others pointed to the construction process, in which piles of surplus rocks reshaped the rivers and changed the currents.At 71m tall, he is indeed grand. His shoulders span 28m, and each of his big toes is 8.5m long. His ears are 7m. Their length symbolises wisdom and the conscious abandonment of materialism. It is said that heavy gold baubles left Siddartha's earlobes elongated even after he was no longer weighed down by material things. Inside the body, hidden from view, is a water-drainage system to prevent weathering, although he is showing his age and soil erosion is an ongoing problem.To fully appreciate this Buddha’s magnitude, get an up-close look at his head, then descend the steep, winding stairway for the Lilliputian view. Avoid visiting on weekends and holidays, when traffic on the staircase can come to a complete standstill and queues can top two hours or more.Afterwards, head up the path to Su's Garden (苏园, Sū Yuán) just above the entry and exit area to the Buddha, a manicured garden around a cliffside teahouse (from ¥20) that's lovely when not hosting lunchtime tour groups.Admission also includes access to a number of caves and temples on the grounds, though they are a decent hike from the main attraction. Mahaoya Tombs Museum has a modest collection of tombs and burial artefacts dating from the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25–220). Wuyou Temple, like the Buddha, dates from the Tang dynasty, and has Ming and Qing renovations. This monastery contains calligraphy and artefacts, with the highlights in the Luohan Hall – 1000 terracotta arhat (Buddhist celestial beings, similar to angels) displaying an incredible variety of postures and facial expressions: no two are alike. Also inside is a fantastic statue of Avalokiteshvara (Guanyin), the Goddess of Mercy.A separate park (not included in the Grand Buddha admission), the Oriental Buddha Capital, houses a collection of 3000 Buddha statues and figurines from across Asia, including a 170m-long reclining Buddha, one of the world’s longest. There is an entrance near the Grand Buddha's south gate; otherwise exit and take bus 3 or 13 (¥1) to the Oriental Buddha Capital (东方佛都, Dōngfāng Fódū) stop. The entrance is further than it looks on the park maps."

        "detail_description": "The magnificent Yading Nature Reserve, 140km south of Daocheng, centres around three sacred snowcapped mountains, a holy trinity encircled by forested valleys, crystal-clear rivers and glacier-fed lakes. These are, quite simply, some of the most stunning landscapes you'll ever see. There are opportunities to hike, ride and camp here.\nLocals have worshipped these mountains for more than 800 years. The three peaks – Chenresig (compassion), Chana Dorje (power) and Jampelyang (wisdom) – represent bodhisattvas in Tibetan Buddhism. Even for nonbelievers, walking the 35km kora (转山; holy hike) around the highest peak, Chenresig (仙乃日; Xiānnǎirì), which tops out at 6032m, can be a hugely meaningful experience.The clockwise circuit around Chenresig begins at Longtong Ba (龙同坝; Lóngtóng Bà) and takes at least 12 hours of serious hiking. To avoid one very long day, many use the campsites located about halfway, just below the first pass beyond Five-Colour Lake. You have to bring all your own gear and supplies. (Though you'll pass locals living in simple stone huts, under park rules they are not supposed to take you in.) Remember to keep the mountain on your right, and to always take the right-hand turn when there’s a choice of paths. There is a longer, four-day, 110km hike that adds a circuit around 5958m Chana Dorje (夏郎多吉; Xiàláng Duōjí), which begins and ends at the same place as the kora.These hiking trails are all around 4000m above sea level, so acclimatise properly and pack for a serious expedition before you set off. Guides are available for hire at Longtong Ba.If you don’t have the time (or energy) for a full circuit, there are day-hike options that see far more visitors. Take the shuttle bus from the ticket office into the park to just beyond the small settlement of Longtong Ba. From here hike 2km to the 800-year-old Chonggu Monastery (冲古寺; Chōnggǔ Sì), where you can pick up electric carts (one way/return ¥50/80, 6km, 20 minutes) into the Luorong Grassland (洛绒牛场; Luòróng Niúchǎng), which offers incredible views of the trinity and is as far as most tourists go. The other direction, uphill from Chonggu Monastery, is a 40-minute(1km) uphill hike to Zhuoma La (卓玛拉; Zhuómă Lā) and a small lake. This lake, just in the shadow of Chenresig's north face, is particularly impressive in spring when surrounded by blooming azalea flowers.It's worth continuing another 5km (three hours) from the Luorong Grasslands to Milk Lake (牛奶海; Níunǎi Hǎi) and stunning Five-Colour Lake (五色海; Wǔsè Hǎi). You can also ride guided mules (return ¥300) for this segment, but keep in mind that even on four legs the round-trip journey takes 5½ hours on a steep, rocky trail. Riders must dismount multiple times to scramble alongside their ride for about a kilometre.Take a shared minibus (per person ¥50, 2½ hours) from Daocheng to the small town of Riwa (日瓦), where you buy tickets for the reserve. The ticket includes a mandatory ¥120 shuttle-bus fee, so take the park shuttle bus the last 32km into the park (50 minutes); it stops first in Yading village and then 3km later at Longtong Ba.There are guesthouses and places to eat in Yading village (亚丁村). To get an early start on the kora sleep in a guesthouse in Yading then catch the 7.30am shuttle the last few kilometres down to Longtong Ba. Buses within the park run from the visitors centre between 7.20am and 5.40pm, and back from Longtong Ba between 9am and 7.30pm.The best times to visit the reserve are May to June and September to early October."

He eventually grew into a visionary leader, and under his rule Tibet established a national archive, instituted civil-service training programmes and formalised the Tibetan government structure. While the building is officially open from 9.30am to 5pm, in practice the hours are erratic. Chinese tourists are normally forbidden from entering inside the building.\nNot all Tibetans shared the belief Gyatso was the reincarnate; to escape the ongoing civil war, the Dalai Lama was raised and educated largely in exile. Qing Emperor Kangxi issued a proclamation affirming his identity, and in 1720 sent his son and troops to install the Dalai Lama to power in Lhasa. Mongol uprisings, rebellions and several coups later, the Dalai Lama gained the support of the clergy and the people.The main house is a series of rooms crowded with devotees lost in prayer, and displays of sacred relics of the Dalai Lama and the 13 other lamas born here. If you ask, the guardian will show you the exact spot where Gyatso was born. There is a small footprint visible in the rock, plus a number of other auspicious signs and markings. Tibetan Buddhist or not, a visit here can be a deeply powerful experience, especially if there are many other pilgrims present.Gyatso's descendants still live in the house next door and it's likely that it will be one of them who shows you around.The area around the house has recently been completely renovated in a sympathetic style and is now one of the more attractive urban neighbourhoods in all of the Tibetan regions."

        "detail_description": "Known locally as ani gompa (Tibetan for ‘nunnery’), Hépíng Fǎhùi is home to around 500 nuns and more than 100 monks. Lama Tsemper was a revered hermit who spent much of his life meditating in a cave about two hours' walk across the grasslands from Tagong. Nuns would bring him food and look after him, so when he requested a temple be built here just before his death in the 1980s it was decided that a nunnery be built too.\nLama Tsemper’s remains are in a chörten (Tibetan stupa) inside the original cave; you may have to ask a nun to unlock the door to look inside. Below the cave is the temple and a huge mani wall as big as the temple itself, which has its own kora that attracts many pilgrims. On the far hill, and overlooking the site, is a huge new building containing the nuns residences and kitchens; a little further uphill from that is a large walled complex containing a new monastery and monks residences called the Mùyă Dàsì (木雅大寺). On the opposite hill is a sky burial site. Here you will find the area where the bodies are cut up and left and a tree in which braids of hair, necklaces, glasses and other personal objects of the deceased are hung. You should not visit the sky burial site if a burial is taking place, but when nothing is happening nobody seems to mind you having a respectful look around. In between all the temples are tiny, fragile wooden houses of more nuns. All are painted a blood-red colour. The whole complex is growing fast as more and more nuns and monks arrive. You could easily spend a full day exploring this extraordinary complex, chatting to the people who live here and walking the kora with the pilgrims.Getting to the nunnery is half the fun and a super little 4km walk from town over the hills and with views over the distant snow peaks. Ask for directions from any of the popular traveller hotels and hostels."

        "detail_description": "One of Chengdu’s most popular attractions, this panda park 18km north of the city centre is the easiest way to glimpse Sichuan’s most famous residents. Don't, however, make the mistake of thinking you'll be seeing wild pandas. They are kept in large enclosures and have a dedicated team of scientists and keepers tending to their every need. As well as living, breathing pandas, there are some fascinating panda information centres and museums explaining panda conservation and husbandry.\nHome to nearly 120 giant and 76 red pandas, the base focuses on getting these notoriously love-shy creatures to breed and has been remarkably successful at it. March to May is the ‘falling in love period’ (wink wink). If you visit during summer or autumn, you may see tiny newborns in the nursery incubators.Try to visit in the morning, when the pandas are most active. Feeding takes place around opening time at 8am, although you’ll see them eating in the late afternoon, too. Pandas spend most of their afternoons sleeping, particularly during the height of midsummer, when they sometimes disappear into their (air-conditioned) living quarters, though some of these have public viewing areas.At the best of times, it can be very busy. At weekends you'll be lucky to spot a panda through the swarms of humans.From exit A of the Panda Avenue (熊猫大道) station on metro line 3 , a free D025 bus transfer is available from 8.30am to 4pm. A taxi from the city centre costs about ¥50, or hostels run trips here. There are also various dedicated buses from the city centre to the gates of the research base. The Panda Bus is one such company and it charges ¥10 from the Wide and Narrow Alley, the Wenshu Monastery and various other locations."

The best time to come from is June to October, ideally during mild July and August. Outside of this period, lack of water in the pools significantly reduces the visual impact of the park.\nVisiting the park essentially means a three- to four-hour moderate hike up and down one small valley on wooden boardwalks. The walk starts by taking a cable car (9am to 5pm), which drops you in a deep forest. A path then leads you up a few kilometres to the start of the main sights, and then down again to the entrance – some 8km of long ascents and descents in all.By the park entrance is a visitor centre with a couple of restaurants, teahouse and luggage check. Pack a picnic as bottled water costs ¥10 in the park. There are also a few expensive tour-group hotels nearby, but most people visit as a day trip from Songpan or Jiuzhaigou."

Turn left out of the ticket office then take the free lift (乘电梯, chéngyúntī; 8am to 7.30pm) down 50 storeys to the foot of the gorge for a 7.5km nature walk to the panda centre entrance. It takes about two hours to reach the centre via the concrete paths passing tall waterfalls, imaginatively named mountains, and a small collection of hanging coffins (悬棺, xuánguān) en route.Although this panda base does get chaotically busy at weekends and in holidays in general, it's much quieter and therefore a more enjoyable visit than the Giant Panda Breeding Research Base in Chengdu. The walk along the valley to the pandas adds to the pleasure of a visit."

The monastery was originally founded in 746 by a Bönpo lama, but has been much reconstructed since and, considering its importance, is quite a small structure, though it's none the less magical for it.\nIn the late 13th century a new Sakya monastery was established on the site of the Bön monastery (Bön was the religion that predated Buddhism on the Tibetan plateau) and the monastery has remained a part of that school of Tibetan Buddhism ever since. However, it has also played an important role in the Rimé movement and is known for its openness to most Tibetan Buddhism schools. The complex contains a number of chapels, one of which houses the ashes of the first and second Rinpoche Dzongsar, who were leading figures in the 19th-century Rimé movement.Colourful traditional wooden housing for the monks is clustered around the monastery and along the valley floor below. It's down on the valley floor that the large and highly regarded shedra (Buddhist college) is located. Around 1900 monks study here. Many of them have studied previously in India and some will likely want to practise their English with you. The colourful buildings and constant ebb and flow of monks moving around the complex make for a wholly exotic and mystical place to explore. Come to the shedra in the early evening and you might catch the courtyard full of hundreds of debating monks. What makes the place so utterly charming is the absolute dearth of other tourists."

An excellent overnight hike (ask in your guesthouse for help finding camping gear and a guide) is to the Eldest Sister Peak Protection Station at 4400m.

There are more than 30 types of bamboo across this 120-sq-km national park and the scenery is gorgeous enough to have attracted many a TV and film director.\nBamboo is an especially fast-growing grass that can shoot up nearly a metre in 24 hours. In May, in between the downpours, you can actually hear the pops and wiggles as new shoots spring up."

The air is heavy with incense and the low murmur of chanting; despite frequent crowds of worshippers, there’s still a sense of serenity and solitude. At weekends free Chinese- and English-language tours of the complex run frequently. Look for the stand advertising them inside the main courtyard.\nThe temple’s popular vegetarian restaurant and teahouse are lovely attractions in their own right. The 'old' neighbourhood streets surrounding the temple are crowded with teahouses, snack stalls and shops; touristy, yes, but fun to wander through."

It's one of the most atmospheric temples in Kham.\nThe temple is dedicated to the Dharma protectors (fierce deities who protect the Buddhist religion and community from threats) and monks are present leading prayers 24 hours a day.It's on the left just up from Qinghe Lu (清河路); look for the gateway topped with small white stupas. The neighbourhood it's in is full of shops selling everything the passing pilgrim, monk or nun might require."

        "detail_description": "The raw mountain beauty and sparkling lakes of Jiuzhaigou National Park was, for many, a highlight of China. However, in August 2017 a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck near Jiuzhaigou, affecting the parks infrastructure. At the time of research the park was closed to independent travellers while renovation work takes place. Check with hostel staff in Chengdu as to whether the park has reopened before venturing up here.\nThe park has three main branches: the Zechawa, Rize and Shuzheng valleys. Additionally, the restricted Zharu Valley is open to those willing to pay a premium for an immersive ecotourism experience. Most travellers should visit the Zechawa Valley (则查洼沟) first, since buses stop heading to the top around 2pm to 3pm. Ride for one hour and the full 18km to the foot of the 4350m length of Long Lake (长海, Cháng Hǎi), then walk back to Five-Coloured Pool (五彩池, Wǔcǎi Chí). It's possible to walk from here all the way back to the Nuorilang Junction (诺日朗中心站, Nuòrìlǎng Zhōngxīn Zhàn) but travellers with limited time would be best advised to take the bus, especially during the low season when water levels are low in the rest of the lakes on this fork.From Nuorilang Bus Station, catch a shuttle for the roughly 19km ride to the Primeval Forest (原生森林, Yuánshēng Sēnlín) at the top of the Rize Valley (日则沟). Though not the most stunning section of the park, the 8km-long stretch of trail down from here to Bamboo Arrow Lake (箭竹海, Jiànzhú Hăi) has some of the least-trodden trails. From here it's a short hike to Panda Lake (熊猫海, Xióngmāo Hǎi), Five-Flower Lake (五花海, Wŭhuā Hǎi) and Pearl Shoals (珍珠滩, Zhēnzhūtán); three of the park's most popular attractions for their crystal-clear water, variety of colourful hues and, at the last, booming waterfalls with snowy peaks in the background. On the way keep an eye out for the path up to the Tiger Mouth (老虎嘴,Lăohŭzuĭ), a cliff-top overlook of Five-Flower Lake that shows better than perhaps anywhere else in Jiuzhaigou the astounding array of colours that are possible in a single small lake.It's around 3km from Pearl Shoals back to the Nuorilang Junction and Waterfall (诺日朗瀑布, Nuòrìlǎng Pùbù), and the top of the Shuzheng Valley (树正沟). Most will skip the majority of this 14km valley, largely because buses tend to stop between 5pm and 6pm, after which the only option is to walk out or hire one of the very rare private vehicles as a taxi. There are a number of pretty lakes and three small Tibetan villages, however, and those with the legs to keep walking will find the paths largely free of visitors. Note that in some of the villages, especially Shuzheng (树正寨, Shùzhèng), travellers may be approached by local families offering homestays from ¥100. This is officially against park regulations, and therefore is not recommended by Lonely Planet.On the way out of the park, shuttles stop a few kilometres before the exit at Zharu Temple (扎如寺, Zhārú Sì), a large Buddhist temple open to visitors from 2pm to 6pm, beyond which lies Zharu Village and the restricted Zharu Valley Ecotourism base. From the temple, it's a pleasant 15-minute walk back to the visitors centre.Inside the park, overpriced snacks are available at any of the Tibetan villages and many of the shuttle-bus stops. For a full meal head to the pricey buffet of the Nuorilang Junction Tourist Service Center, or walk uphill about 400m to a row of small restaurants with mains from ¥18 to ¥58.Seniors 70 and over and kids get in free but are required to purchase ¥10 visitor insurance. A ¥90 hop-on-hop-off bus fee is automatically included in admission for all visitors. During the low season (16 November to 31 March), admission tickets are valid for a second day of entry to the park."

Its beautiful trails are lined with ginkgo, plum and palm, and there are caves, pavilions and centuries-old wooden temples to explore.\nVisitors can experience two sides of the mountain. The main entrance is on the mountain's front side (前山, Qián Shān) and leads to paths that wind past 11 important Taoist sites. Those interested in hiking will prefer the quieter and more scenic back mountain (后山, Hòu Shān), accessed 40km northwest. In either case, to actually enjoy the views, avoid major holidays when masses of tourists arrive to pay tribute to their ancestors.The trails at Qian Shan lead to a summit of only 1260m, a relatively easy climb – four hours up and down, even easier via the cable car (one way/return ¥35/60). Snack stands are scattered along the mountain trails, and several of the major temples have small restaurants.If you want to spend the night, a few temples on Qian Shan welcome guests. Most atmospheric is the fantastic Shangqing Temple, a Qing-dynasty rebuild of the original Jin-dynasty temple in the middle of a forest near the top of the mountain, with guest rooms and a restaurant/teahouse attached. Alternatively, the Tianshi Cave Temple has slightly less-welcoming rooms, but is on a quieter stretch of the mountain.Hou Shan, the back of the mountain, has 20km of rugged pathways – expect a six-hour round-trip hike to the 2128m summit, where you’ll find Baiyun Temple (白云寺, Báiyún Sì); the cable cars at Jinli (one way/return ¥30/55) and Baiyun (one way/return ¥45/80) can shave a couple of hours off the hike. You can find some guesthouses (山庄, shānzhuāng) at Youyi Village (又一村, Yòuyī Cūn), around halfway up the mountain's west side, of which Jiachun Villa is among the best."

        "detail_description": "A popular subject of paintings for Chinese art students, this ancient river village began as a way-station on the southern Silk Road more than 2000 years ago. Many of the wooden buildings have been rebuilt, but some date to the Ming and Qing dynasties and locals still live among the ever-multiplying trinket shops.\nThe town’s most venerable inhabitants are its banyan trees, a dozen of which are more than 1000 years old. The most charming of old stone passageways, Fuhui Street Water Gate (福惠街水门, Fuhuì Jie Shuimen), leads down to the river where you can lounge on a bamboo chair and sip tea (¥20 to ¥50). Cross the river and you can wander away to the decidedly untouristy surrounding farmland and small tea plantations.Hardly any foreign tourists visit, but at weekends and on holidays half of Chengdu seems to decamp to here and commercialism threatens to overwhelm the charm. However, just enough real life remains to make this a pleasant day trip from Chengdu, especially in warm months when there's fun to be had in the water and a nice breeze keeps things cool in the many shaded teahouses on the riverfront. Try Wáng Páng Zi Nǎi Tāngmiàn, an open-fronted place a block back from the river and on a quiet street, which serves nai tang mian (奶汤面) – noodles in a plain, milky broth – as well as versions loaded with spice.If you want to linger, there are comfortable guesthouses (客栈, kèzhàn) and other accommodations (住宿, zhùsù) along both river banks. Gǔbù Kèzhàn has bright little rooms with river views.Buses to Pingle usually stop first at the small town of Qionglai (邛崃), about 15 minutes before Pingle – don’t get off here by mistake. Once in Pingle, walk out of the bus station and turn right for the river – it's straight ahead. Buses leave for Chengdu’s Xinnanmen bus station from 9.20am to 5.30pm about every 1½hrs (¥33, two hours). For other long-distance destinations you'll need to transfer in Qionglai (¥5, between 8.30am and 6.25pm)."
