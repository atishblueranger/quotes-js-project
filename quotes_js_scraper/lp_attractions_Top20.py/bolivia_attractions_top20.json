        "detail_description": "The world's largest salt flat sits at a lofty 3653m (11,985ft) and blankets an amazing 12,000 sq km (4633 sq miles). It was part of a prehistoric salt lake, Lago Minchín, which once covered most of southwest Bolivia. When it dried up, it left a couple of seasonal puddles and several salt pans, including Salar de Uyuni. The savage beauty of this vast salt desert makes it one of South America's most awe-inspiring spectacles.\nFrom strange islands in a sea of blindingly bright salt to delicately colored mineral lakes in the Andean mountains, this is an unforgettable Bolivian landscape.However, travelers should take great care in choosing which tour operator to go with when visiting the salt flats. Fatal accidents due to unsafe vehicles and drivers are not unheard of. Make sure your vehicles have seat belts, emergency radio transmitters and first aid equipment, and don't shy away from asking about the guides' levels of training and experience. Of course, there are also many reputable tour operators in the area who will ensure your experience of this natural wonder is both memorable and safe."

If you’re building a new house you can buy a llama fetus to bury beneath the cornerstone as a cha’lla (offering) to Pachamama (Mother Earth). If you're feeling ill or being pestered by bothersome spooks, you can purchase a plateful of colorful herbs, seeds and assorted critter parts to remedy the problem. As you pass the market stalls, watch for wandering yatiris (traditional healers), who wear dark hats and carry coca pouches, and offer (mainly to locals) fortune-telling services.Inquiries and photographs taken here may be met with unpleasantness – ask politely first."

Also on display are colonial artifacts and colorful dolls wearing traditional costumes. A pleasant cafe is on the premises.Also known as Museo del Oro (Gold Museum), the Museo de Metales Preciosos houses four impressively presented salons of pre-Columbian silver, gold and copper works and pieces from Tiwanaku.The diminutive Museo del Litoral consists mainly of historical maps that defend Bolivia’s emotionally charged claims to Antofagasta and Chile’s Segunda Región.Once the home of Pedro Domingo Murillo, a leader in the La Paz Revolution of July 16, 1809, the Casa de Murillo displays collections of colonial art, furniture and household items of glass and silver that once belonged to Bolivian aristocracy."

        "detail_description": "As you might have guessed from the dinosaur figure in the plaza or the dinosaur head sticking out of city hall, Torotoro has become synonymous with paleontology. The village, which sits in a wide section of a 20km-long valley at an elevation of 2600m, is flanked by enormous, inclined mudstone rock formations bearing bipedal and quadrupedal dinosaur tracks from the Cretaceous period (spanning 145 million to 65 million years ago).\nThere are numerous tracks (huellas) all over the place and much work remains to be done on their interpretation. Many different dinosaur species are represented, both herbivorous and carnivorous.The closest tracks are at Cerro Huayllas, at the entrance to the village, on the other side of the river. It's behind a locked fence so you'll need an official guide to enter (most people visit as part of the hike to Cañon de Torotoro &amp; El Vergel). Above the water but below the road are the area’s largest tracks, made by an enormous quadruped dinosaur (diplodocus or similar) and measuring 35cm wide, 50cm long and 20cm deep. Near here, just above the road, the angled plane of rock reveals a multitude of different tracks, including a long set from a heavy quadrupedal dinosaur that some have posited are those of the armadillo-like ankylosaurus.Along the route to Umajalanta cave, the flat area known as the Carreras Pampa site has several excellent sets of footprints (on both sides of the path). These were made by three-toed bipedal dinosaurs, both herbivores (with rounded toes) and carnivores (pointed toes, sometimes with the claw visible).All the tracks in the Torotoro area were made in soft mud, which then solidified into mudstone. They were later lifted and tilted by tectonic forces. For that reason, many of the tracks appear to lead uphill. Many local guides, however, incorrectly believe that the footprints were made in lava as the dinosaurs fled a volcanic eruption."

From the camp, you can take short walks in the rainforest to lagoons with caimans, other larger animals and profuse birdlife.\nThe camp has shady, covered picnic sites, trees, children’s swings and a variety of native plants, birds and animals. There’s also an archaeological museum displaying articles excavated from the loma, including bizarre statues as well as a piece that appears to be a female figure wearing a bikini (it’s actually thought to be an identification of, and homage to, specific body areas rather than an article of clothing).You can volunteer here (one week minimum) and package-tour visits booked in Trinidad may work out a bit cheaper. Further information is available from managers Miriam and Efrem Ibis, or travel agencies in Trinidad. Unless you organize a tour, which will include transportation, you’ll have to negotiate with a moto-taxi driver (typically B$20) for the 14km journey north of town. It’s also a good destination for those who’ve rented their own motorcycles."

Make sure you have good nonslip shoes on. You eventually descend to a small underground lake and river, which is populated by small, white, completely blind catfish. The ascent from here is fairly easy, as it takes a more direct route.There are numerous other caverns in the area, most of which are virtually unexplored.The 8km one-way walk to the cavern entrance takes two hours from the village; it's a completely exposed uphill slog.

However, it's not so much the quality of the architecture or art that's noteworthy, but rather the challenge to your imagination in picturing and conceiving what life was like for the cloistered nuns here.\nAfter the original building, built in 1760, was destroyed in an earthquake, a new church was built in 1790 with an excess of ambition, but was too big to be domed. Beginning in 2014, much of the building was slowly and painstakingly restored; several boarded up passageways and unused pulpits have been revealed. There’s still a Carmelite community here, but its handful of nuns are now housed in more comfortable modern quarters next door."

In addition, the steps up are extremely steep and only worth considering if you're in the mood and shape for an intense cardio workout.

        "detail_description": "At 12-hectare Senda Verde, there's a new concept: humans are 'caged' while most of the 200-plus monkeys run free. This protects people and monkeys alike (adult monkeys can be aggressive, and sick humans can infect their simian cousins). Toucans, caimans, Andean bears, ocelots and margays are among the other wild residents. There’s a nice buffet-style restaurant on-site. Located 500m north of Yolosa (B$40 taxi or B$10 minibus from Coroico).\nThe refuge provides a sanctuary for animals that have been rescued from illegal traffickers. Reservations are required. You can stay overnight, or simply come for an hour-long tour. Volunteering is possible (two-week minimum) for B$1370 per week, including three meals."

Guides with the necessary lamps will help you find your way around. PCMB, the Bolivian program to conserve bats, has identified three nectar- and insect-eating bats in the pitch-black surroundings.\nIt’s a scenic 15km hike to the cave along a dirt road (two hours each way). Taxis will do the return trip for around B$80, including waiting time. The local community has also set up two simple albergues (basic accommodations) to overnight in. There are a total of four rooms with a single bed in each and prices are B$30 per person."

Climb the wooden viewing platform for vistas across the treetop canopy to the city skyline. The gardens are teeming with wildlife, too; look out for tortoises and sloths.\nTo get here, take the green minibus marked Cotoca from the corner of Suárez Arana and Barrón and ask the driver to drop you at the entrance to the Jardín Botánico (B$2.50, 25 minutes)."

It’s a fascinating display and has an interesting subtext: the rediscovery of forgotten ancestral weaving practices has contributed to increased community pride and revitalization. Information in English is available and you can observe the weavers patiently at work.\nThe adjoining store markets ceramics and weavings, but it’s a more satisfying experience to buy them direct from the villages where they are made."
