        "detail_description": "One of the easiest and most satisfying half-day trips from Bled is to Vintgar Gorge, some 4km to the northwest of Bled village. The highlight is a 1600m wooden walkway through the gorge, built in 1893 and continually rebuilt since. It criss-crosses the swirling Radovna River four times over rapids, waterfalls and pools before reaching 16m-high Šum Waterfall.\nThe entire walk is spectacular, although it can get wet and slippery. There are little snack bars at the beginning and the end of the walkway; the path to view Šum Waterfall is behind the kiosk at the walkway's end.It's an easy walk to the gorge from Bled. Head northwest on Prešernova cesta then north on Partizanska cesta to Cesta Vintgar. This will take you to Podhom, where signs show the way to the gorge entrance. To return, you can either retrace your steps or, from Šum Waterfall, walk eastward over Hom (834m) to the ancient pilgrimage Church of St Catherine (signed 'Katarina Bled'), which retains some 15th-century fortifications. From there it's due south through Zasip to Bled. Count on about three hours all in.In July and August, buses leaves Bled bus station daily at 8.30am, 9.30am and 10.30am for Vintgar, stopping at several points in town, including Bled Castle, along the way."

        "detail_description": "Crowning a 375m-high hill east of the Old Town, this castle is an architectural mishmash, with most of it dating from the early 16th century when it was largely rebuilt after a devastating earthquake. It’s free to ramble around the castle grounds, but you’ll have to pay to enter the Watchtower and the Chapel of St George, and to see the worthwhile Slovenian History Exhibition, visit the Puppet Theatre and take the Time Machine tour.\nThere are several ways to access the castle, with the easiest being a 70m-long funicular that leaves from the Old Town not far from the market on Vodnikov trg. There's also an hourly tourist train that departs from south of the Ljubljana TIC. There are three main walking routes: Študentovska ulica, which runs south from Ciril Metodov trg; steep Reber ulica from Stari trg; and Ulica na Grad from Gornji trg.You can explore the castle's various attractions at your own pace, or join one of the highly recommended 90-minute Time Machine tours, led by costumed guides.The castle's 19th-century watchtower is located on the southwestern side of the castle courtyard. The climb to the top, via a double wrought-iron staircase (95 steps from the museum level) and a walk along the ramparts, is worth the effort for the views down into the Old Town and across the river to Center. Within the watchtower, there is a 12-minute video tour of Ljubljana and its history in several languages.Situated below the watchtower down a small flight of stairs, the remarkable Chapel of St George (Kapela Sv Jurija) is one of the oldest surviving remnants of the castle, dating from 1489. It is covered in frescoes and the coats of arms of the Dukes of Carniola.The interesting and well-presented interactive Slovenian History Exhibition (Razstava Slovenska Zgodovina) looks at the country through the ages, running from the very earliest Roman times, through the Middle Ages, the 19th century, WWI and WWII, and ending with socialist Yugoslavia and independence.Also worth a look, the Museum of Puppetry (Lutkovni Muzej) explores the world of puppetry, from the manufacture of marionettes and glove puppets to the staging of the shows themselves. It's very interactive and lots of fun.The Ljubljana Castle Information Centre can advise on tours and events that might be on during your visit."

From the pass itself, the peak-tastic views take in Mojstrovka (2332m) to the west and Prisojnik/Prisank (2547m) to the east; to the south the valley of the Soča River points the way to western Slovenia.\nFrom Kranjska Gora, as the road reaches just over 1100m you come to the beautiful wooden Russian Chapel, erected on the site where more than 300 Russian POWs were buried in an avalanche in March 1916. From here the climb begins in earnest as the road meanders past a couple of huts and corkscrews up the next few kilometers to the pass itself.\nFrom here, a hair-raising descent of about 10km ends just short of a monument to Dr Julius Kugy (1858–1944), a pioneer climber and writer whose books eulogize the beauty of the Julian Alps.\nThe road continues to the settlements of Trenta and Soča, 8km downstream. The activity hub of Bovec is 12km west of Soča. En route, the narrow Lepena Valley is well worth a detour, for accommodation, splendid vistas and a range of walks.\nPhoto credit: Nino Marcutti\n"

The nave is Romanesque, but the Gothic presbytery dates from about 1440. Many walls and ceilings are covered with 15th- and 16th-century frescoes.\nAs you face the arch from the nave, look for the frescoes on either side gorily depicting the beheading of the church's patron saint. On the opposite side of the arch, to the left, is Abel making his offering to God and, to the right, Cain with his inferior one. Upon the shoulder of history's first murderer sits a white devil – a rare symbol. Behind you on the lower walls of the presbytery are rows of angels, some with vampire-like teeth; look for the three men above them singing. They have goitres, once a common affliction in mountainous regions due to the lack of iodine in the diet. The carved wooden head of St John the Baptist on the side altar to the right dates from 1380."

The castle houses a museum collection that traces the lake’s history from earliest times to the development of Bled as a resort in the 19th century.\nThe castle, built on two levels, dates back to the early 11th century, although most of what stands here now is from the 16th century. For 800 years it was the seat of the Bishops of Brixen. Among the museum holdings, there's a large collection of armour and weapons, and jewellery found at the early Slav burial pits at Pristava. The smallish 16th-century Gothic chapel contains paintings of castle donor Henry II and his wife Kunigunda on either side of the main altar.You can reach the castle on foot via one of three trails signposted 'Grad'. The first trail starts from the car park behind the Bledec Hostel; the second is a tortuous path up from the Castle Lido swimming area; and the third starts just north of the Parish Church of St Martin."

Today the castle houses the Loka Museum, which boasts an excellent ethnographic collection spread over two-dozen galleries on two floors. Exhibits run the gamut from taxidermied animals to church frescoes by way of local painters, lace-making traditions and WWII partisans; English labelling can be patchy for some exhibits.\nIn the garden, you’ll find a typical peasant house from nearby Puštal dating from the 16th century. Don't miss the four spectacular golden altars in the castle chapel. These date from the 17th century and were taken from a church destroyed during WWII in Dražgoše, northwest of Škofja Loka.Two paths lead up to the castle from the Old Town; one starts just opposite Kavarna Homan, the other next to Martin House. A longer walking trail, the Three Castles Path, begins at the castle and travels a circular, forested path for about 5km (two hours), past the ruins of the Krancelj Tower and the Old Castle. The TIC has a brochure with map."

You can also observe a live beehive in action, filled with a family of indigenous Carniolan bees.\nBees are still kept in Slovenia for their honey and wax but much more lucrative are such by-products as pollen, propolis and royal jelly.The somewhat esoteric municipal museum shares the building with the beekeeping museum (open the same hours; combined ticket adult/child €5/3). It tells the history of the town, especially as it relates to the life of Anton Tomaž Linhart (1756–95). Linhart was Slovenia’s first dramatist and historian, and was born in Radovljica."

It is a stunning mountain, dominating the largest national park in the country (also named Triglav), which is an exhilarating place for nature lovers to visit.\nThat said, ascending Triglav is not a weekend hike. It's a challenging climb, and the final path to the summit is a protected climbing route known as a via ferrata. These parts of the trail are secured with steel cables and fixed pegs, so if you don’t have high alpine hiking and via ferrata experience, you shouldn’t even consider hiking Triglav without hiring a certified guide to accompany you.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, the weather can change rapidly and can differ dramatically as you climb, and it's not uncommon for even experienced climbers to lose their way and need assistance. Slovenia's mountain rescue publishes up-to-date information about Triglav on its website and social media – this is an invaluable resource for anyone enjoying outdoor activities in the country.\r\n\r\nLearn more about hiking in Slovenia with our  hiking guide."

When it was built as a single span in 1842 it was nothing spectacular, but between 1929 and 1932 superstar architect Jože Plečnik added the two pedestrian side bridges, furnished all three with stone balustrades and lamps, and forced a name change. Stairways on each of the side bridges lead down to the poplar-lined terraces along the Ljubljanica River.\n"

The excellent collections, which deal with mercury, lace and local history (but, sadly, not žlikrofi) are exhibited in three wings centred on a beautiful courtyard, and an accompanying booklet guides visitors through the rooms.\nExhibits span rocks and fossils (and a bowl of mercury in room 3) to lifestyles of the miners and the growth of the town. Head down the steps of the Mercury Tower (room 7) to see the mining tools used, and also the lovely modern sculpture of mercury drops suspended in perspex.Another highlight is the wing given over entirely to the bobbin lace (klekljana čipka) woven here. Check out the tablecloth that measures 3m by 1.8m. It was designed for Madame Tito and took 5000 hours to make.The castle itself was built in the 1520s to serve as the administrative headquarters of the Idrija mine."

        "detail_description": "This clandestine hospital, hidden in a canyon near Dolenji Novaki, about 5km northeast of Cerkno, treated wounded Partisan soldiers from Yugoslavia and other countries from late 1943 until the end of WWII. A memorial to humanity and self-sacrifice, it had more than a dozen wooden cabins, including treatment huts, operating theatres, X-ray rooms and huts for convalescence. Some 578 wounded were treated here, and of these only 78 died.\nThe complex, hidden in a ravine by a stream, had an abundance of fresh water, which was also used to power a hydroelectric generator. Local farmers and Partisan groups provided food, which was lowered down the steep cliffs by rope; medical supplies were diverted from hospitals in occupied areas or later air-dropped by the Allies. The hospital came under attack by the Germans twice but it was never taken.The hospital was almost entirely destroyed by flood in 2007, and has been completely reconstructed. It's extremely well done, with detailed information panels in both English and Slovene in each building; access is via a lovely 500m stream-side walking path."

The statue of a nattily dressed gentleman in the centre is of native son, composer and violinist Giuseppe Tartini (1692–1770). East is the 1818 Church of St Peter. Across from the church is Tartini House, the composer’s birthplace. The Court House and the porticoed 19th-century Municipal Hall, home to the tourist information centre, dominate the western edge of the square.\nThe 15th-century stone pillars of the two flagpoles at the entrance to the square bear Latin inscriptions praising Piran, the town’s coat of arms, a relief of St George (the patron) to the left and one of St Mark with the lion symbol on the right.For superb aerial views of the square, climb to the Bell Tower of the Cathedral of St George."

The tour covers about 1200m and lasts 1½ hours; it begins in the ‘call room’ of an 18th-century building where miners were selected each morning and assigned their duties.\nYou'll be supplied overcoats and helmets; the temperature in the mine is around 13°C (55°F). There are also exhibitions in the old smelting plant.For more on the town's mercury heritage, pick up the free and informative Idrija: A Heritage of Mercury from the TIC."
