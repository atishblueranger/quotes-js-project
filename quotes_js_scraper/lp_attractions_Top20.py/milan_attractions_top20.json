        "detail_description": "Conceived by designer Miuccia Prada and architect Rem Koolhaas, this museum is as innovative and creative as the minds that gave it shape. Seven renovated buildings and three new structures have transformed a century-old gin distillery into 19,000 sq metres of exciting, multilevel exhibition space. The buildings, including the shimmering Haunted House clad in gold leaf and a bold 60m-high white concrete tower, work seamlessly together, presenting some stunning visual perspectives.\nInside, temporary and permanent exhibits fill the diverse spaces that finally allow for the display of the foundation’s extensive contemporary collection, which includes pieces by Anish Kapoor, Louise Bourgeois, Francesco Vezzoli and Nathalie Djurberg. Film screenings, performances and events are also part of the cultural program.Almost as popular as the exhibits is the Wes Anderson–designed cafe, Bar Luce, with its wallpapered 1950s-inspired interior, complete with jukebox, themed pinball machines and rows of candy jars. The 6th-floor Torre restaurant is also worth a stop, especially for its skyline views."

Rubens, Goya and Van Dyck all have a place, but you're here for the Italians: Titian, Tintoretto, Veronese and the Bellini brothers. Much of the work has tremendous emotional clout, most notably Mantegna's brutal Lamentation over the Dead Christ.\nAudio guides are available in Italian, French, English, Spanish, German and Russian (€5). Highlights include the glass-walled restoration laboratory, where you can see conservators at work. Additionally, every third Thursday atmospheric musical concerts are held amid the artworks, and entrance to the museum is just €3. And if all that art-gazing has whet your appetite, there's also an elegant new bar/cafe for light snacks or cocktails.Much anticipated is the opening of the beautifully restored 18th-century Palazzo Citterio, now scheduled for summer 2020 after suffering structural and bureaucratic setbacks. It will provide a new 6500-sq-metre home to Brera's modernist collection, as well as showcasing exciting temporary exhibitions in James Stirling's austere concrete bunker beneath the palace's frescoed halls."

        "detail_description": "Originally a Visconti fortress, this iconic red-brick castle was later home to the mighty Sforza dynasty, who ruled Renaissance Milan. The castle's defences were designed by the multitalented da Vinci; Napoleon later drained the moat and removed the drawbridges. Today, it houses seven specialised museums, which gather together intriguing fragments of Milan’s cultural and civic history, including Michelangelo’s final work, the Rondanini Pietà, now housed in the frescoed hall of the castle's Ospedale Spagnolo (Spanish Hospital).\nOf the museums, the most interesting is the Musei d'Arte Antica (Museum of Ancient Art), which is displayed in the ducal apartments, some of which are frescoed by Leonardo da Vinci. Included in the collection are early paleo-Christian sculptures, the superb equestrian tomb of Bernarbò Visconti and sculpted reliefs depicting Milan's triumph over Barbarossa. The exhibit eloquently tells the story of the birth of Italy's first city comune through murderous dynastic and regional ambitions, which made this one of the most powerful courts in Europe.On the 1st floor, the Museo dei Mobile (Furniture Museum) and Pinacoteca (Picture Gallery) blend seamlessly, leading you from ducal wardrobes and writing desks through to a collection of Lombard Gothic art. Among the masterpieces are Andrea Mantegna's Trivulzio Madonna, Vincenzo Foppa's St Sebastian and Bramantino's Noli me tangere (Touch Me Not). The furniture display continues on to the late 20th century, touching on design greats such as Ettore Sottsass and Giò Ponti on its way.Free entry is offered every first Sunday of the month and from 2pm every first and third Tuesday. To tour the castle battlements and underground rooms, consider a tour with Ad Artem."

Portaluppi's commingling of art deco and rationalist styles powerfully evokes Milan's modernist imaginings. However, purists will lament later classical renovations by Tomaso Buzzi, favoured architect of the bourgeoisie.\nQuotidian details – silk evening frocks hanging at the ready, luggage for the sisters' many overseas jaunts and dinnerware designed by Gio Ponti – are as enthralling as the sleek architectural lines and big-ticket artworks by Morandi and de Chirico. Enjoy a drink at the cafe by the pool while you're there."

It contains the saint's relics and is rendered in exquisite sculptural detail by Giovanni di Balduccio, making it one of the finest sarcophagi in Italy.

First the French carved out orchards; next they mooted the idea in 1891 of a vast public park. It was a resounding success, and today Milanese of all ages come to enjoy its winding paths and ornamental ponds. Giò Ponti's 1933 steel tower, built for a Triennale exhibition, provides a fantastic 108m-high viewing platform over the park.\nAlso in the park is the Arena Civica, Napoleon's mini-colosseum, which he opened in typically flamboyant style in 1807. Built by Luigi Canonica, its ingenious engineering allowed it to be flooded with water from nearby canals to stage mock sea battles. Now it hosts community football and rugby matches, and the last stage of the annual city marathon."

        "detail_description": "Dominating Via Sant'Andrea is the baroque facade of the Palazzo Morando Attendolo Bolognini, home to the Bolognini family until 1945. The personal apartments of the countess exhibit her porcelain, sculpture and objets d'art, while other rooms exhibit the city's civic art collection. The paintings provide an insight into Milan during the Napoleonic and Austrian eras and have been instrumental in helping historians piece together an accurate portrait of the city.\n"

Decorated in the style of the ducal palaces in Mantua, the apartments are full of Renaissance furnishings, ceiling friezes, tapestries and paintings. They even had a period stone bath, although it was discreetly retrofitted for running water.\n"

Designed by iconic Milanese architect Piero Portaluppi, the seemingly austere exterior of stone and marble is balanced with art deco touches and a playful trail of constellations as decoration. While almost all sessions are in Italian, for astronomy fans it’s still well worth it.\n"
