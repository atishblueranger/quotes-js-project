        "detail_description": "Is there a science to skateboarding? Do toilets really flush counterclockwise in Australia? At San Francisco's hands-on science museum, you'll find out things you wish you learned in school.\nCombining science with art and investigating human perception, the Exploratorium nudges you to question how you perceive the world around you. The setting is thrilling: a 9-acre, glass-walled pier jutting straight into San Francisco Bay, with large outdoor portions you can explore free of charge, 24 hours a day.\n\n  \nThe Exploratorium has hosted thousands of exhibits over the years, so there's something new to see on the regular © Exploratorium, www.exploratorium.edu\n\nWhat to do at the Exploratorium\nCovering a whopping 330,000 square feet of indoor-outdoor space, galleries focus on color, sound, light and motion, stimulating learning by inviting participation. Never didactic, always engaging, the more than 600 exhibits have buttons to push, cranks to ratchet and dials to adjust, all created by artists and scientists at the in-house building shop (which you should peer into).\nTry on a punk hairdo, courtesy of the static-electricity station. Turn your body into the gnomon of a sundial. Slide, climb and feel your way – in total darkness – through the labyrinth of the Tactile Dome (reservations and separate ticket required).The Exploratorium is split up into several different galleries, each organized around a particular scientific theme.\n\n  \nThe interactive nature of the exhibits mean they're fun for all ages © Exploratorium, www.exploratorium.edu\n\nGalleries and exhibits at the Exploratorium\nThe Bernard and Barbro Osher Gallery is dedicated to Human Penomena, including thoughts, feelings, and social behavior, exploring concepts like sharing, normalcy, mental health, and cooperation. The playful exhibits here invite participants to find out how making seemingly innocuous decisions like whether to squirt a friend at the Trust Fountain can teach us about real-world challenges like solving climate change.\nThe Tactile Dome (which has an additional cost of $8–$15 on top of the regular Exploratorium admission) has been a favorite at the museum since 1971. Initially designed by Dr. August F. Coppola (yes, those Coppolas) and updated in 2013, this exhibit is part art project, part science experiment. Enter the dome and feel your way through a variety of textures in total darkness, finding out first hand how far your senses can take you.\n\n  \nThe Exploratorium grounds its science lessons in real-world applications © Exploratorium, www.exploratorium.edu\n\nThe Tinkering Gallery is lots of fun for young inventors, with a model of San Francisco made from 100,000 toothpicks and chances to mess around with circuit boards, Rube Goldberg machines, and the construction of moving sculptures.\nThe Bechtel Gallery is focused on Seeing and Reflections. Play with the shifting, flowing colors of the Cubatron Core sculpture by artist Mark Lottor, experiment with shape and light in the Giant Mirror, paint with soap film, and step into a room where there are no colors – like your own black and white photograph come to life. \n\n  \nThis bicycle wheel throws a \"jump rope\" twenty feet in the air © Exploratorium, www.exploratorium.edu\n\nThe Living Systems Gallery is like a trip on the Magic School Bus, with exhibits on human cells, plankton colonies, shifting tides, botony, and how microscopes capture the teensiest creepy crawlies.\nThe Outdoor Exhibits Gallery invites visitors to ponder the science of San Francisco itself, from the winds buffeting the bay to the earthquakes that have rattled its buildings and bridges. Some of the Exploratorium's most famous exhibits are out here, including an Aeolian Harp, wind arrows, and a machine made of bike parts that creates the most epic game of jump rope you've ever seen.\nThe Fisher Bay Observatory Gallery dials into observing landscapes both urban and rural, with exhibits on geology, the solar system, and a huge map of the Bay Area that clocks shifts in fog, water salinity, rainfall, and population demographics. What can you observe in the world around you?\n\n  \nThe Exploratorium's new, custom-built building comes after the original museum provided decades of fun and education ©Worayoot Pechsuwanrungsee/Shutterstock\n\nVisiting the Exploratorium\nThe Exploratorium is reopening July 1st after the COVID-19 pandemic, and its new hours will be Wednesday–Saturday: 10:00AM - 5:00PM and Sunday noon - 5PM, with the museum closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. Members have an extra opportunity to visit on Sundays from 10AM to noon. Adults over 18 can take advantage of special kids-free after hours, too, from 6PM to 10PM on Thursdays.\nTickets run $29.95 for adults from 18-64, $24.95 for seniors over 65, teachers, and teens from 13-17, $19.95 for children 12 and under, and children under three are free. Currently, the Exploratorium requires timed ticketed purchases in advance to facilitate social distancing, so it's wise to book in advance.\nThe Exploratorium is easy to reach on the San Francisco waterfront. You can get to Pier 15 via any BART route that stops at the Embarcadero station (with a ten minute walk following). Numerous bike racks are on site, along with parking garages in the area including Pier 19.5 Parking Lot and the Exploratorium Pier 15 Lot between Front and Green Street.\nThere are two eateries on site. The Seaglass Restaurant helmed by Chef Loretta Keller focuses on family-friendly fare with fun drinks for the grownups that uses the Icy Bodies exhibit to shake up the bar area. The Seismic Joint Cafe is more of a coffee shop situation, with take-away pastries and jolts of caffeine to enjoy on the Exploratorium grounds.\n\n  \nExhibits at the Exploratorium often blend both art and science in interactive learning moments​ © Exploratorium, www.exploratorium.edu ​\n\nAccessibility at the Exploratorium\nHandicapped parking is available on the street. Visitors with disabilities can get a discounted price of admission of $24.95 if you call ahead or email visit@exploratorium.edu, and visitors' ADA aids are admitted for free. \nThe whole museum is accessible for visitors who use mobility aids, and several wheelchairs are available on loan from the Information Desk. You may also request tactile maps for blind and visually impaired visitors. For the deaf and hard of hearing, call the Reservations office to request an ASL interpreter at least a week ahead of time. the Kanbar Forum theater space can be accessed via a wheelchair lift on site and through assistive listening systems.\n\n  \nDrag Queens take part in the Exploratorium exhibits at an adults-only after hours event © Exploratorium, www.exploratorium.edu ​\n\nThe history of the Exploratorium\nFrank Oppenheimer founded the Exploratorium in 1969. He'd been a physicist on the atom bomb project and was blackballed during the McCarthy era, then later reemerged as a high-school teacher, eschewing secret scientific study in favor of public education. The Exploratorium is his lasting legacy, with the mission to incorporate technology with human values.\nIn 2013, the Exploratorium moved from the Marina to Piers 15 and 17, where a brand-new purpose-built solar-powered space was constructed in concert with scientific agencies, including NOAA, which hardwired the entire pier with sensors delivering real-time data on weather, wind, tides and the bay. See the data flow in at your final stop, the Observatory Gallery, a glass-enclosed lookout where you can make your own observations about sea, land and sky.\n"

        "detail_description": "\nAlcatraz: for over 150 years, the name has given the innocent chills and the guilty cold sweats. Over the decades, it’s been a military prison, a forbidding maximum-security penitentiary and disputed territory between Native American activists and the FBI. No wonder that first step you take onto ‘the Rock’ seems to cue ominous music: dunh-dunh-dunnnnh!\nIt's also no wonder that Alcatraz garners 1.4 million visitors each year. With easy access from a major city, a thrilling and unexpected history, and stunning views of the San Francisco skyline, The Rock remains one of the most visited national parks in the US system. But for much of Alcatraz's history, this was a place people worked very hard to escape – not spend a pleasant afternoon with their families.\n\n  \nToday the former cellblock of Alcatraz is one of the site's most riveting features ©blazg/Shutterstock\n\nThe history of Alcatraz\nIt all started innocently enough back in 1775, when Spanish lieutenant Juan Manuel de Ayala sailed the San Carlos past the 22-acre island he called Isla de Alcatraces (Isle of the Pelicans). In 1859 a new post on Alcatraz became the first US West Coast fort, and soon proved handy as a holding pen for Civil War deserters, insubordinates and those who had been court-martialed.\nAmong the prisoners were Native American scouts and ‘unfriendlies,’ including 19 Hopis who refused to send their children to government boarding schools, where speaking Hopi and practicing their religion were punishable by beatings. By 1902 the four cell blocks of wooden cages were rotting, unsanitary and otherwise ill-equipped for the influx of US soldiers convicted of war crimes in the Philippines. The army began building a new concrete military prison in 1909, but upkeep was expensive and the US soon had other things to worry about: WWI, financial ruin and flappers.\nWhen the 18th Amendment to the Constitution declared selling liquor a crime in 1922, rebellious Jazz Agers weren’t prepared to give up their tipple – and gangsters kept the booze coming. Authorities were determined to make a public example of criminal ringleaders, and in 1934 the Federal Bureau of Prisons took over Alcatraz as a prominent showcase for its crime-fighting efforts.\n\n  \nBuilt in 1857, the Sally Port Guardhouse is the oldest building on Alcatraz Island ©pixy/Shutterstock\n\n‘The Rock’ averaged only 264 inmates, but its roster read like an America’s Most Wanted list. A-list criminals doing time on Alcatraz included Chicago crime boss Al ‘Scarface’ Capone, dapper kidnapper George ‘Machine Gun’ Kelly, hot-headed Harlem mafioso and sometime poet ‘Bumpy’ Johnson, and Morton Sobell, the military contractor found guilty of Soviet espionage along with Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.\nOne of the prison's most famous residents was Robert Franklin Stroud, also known as the Birdman for his hobby of studying and caring for birds while in solitary confinement at Leavenworth before being transferred to The Rock. He became famous as portrayed by Burt Lancaster in 1962 film The Birdman of Alcatraz, a fictionalization of the so-called Battle of Alcatraz, a failed 1946 escape plot by convict Bernard Coy and other inmates that turned into a deadly standoff.\nToday, first-person accounts of daily life in the Alcatraz lockup are included on the award-winning audio tour provided by Alcatraz Cruises. But take your headphones off for just a moment and notice the sound of carefree city life traveling across the water: this is the torment that made perilous escapes into riptides worth the risk. Though Alcatraz was considered escape-proof, in 1962 the Anglin brothers and Frank Morris floated away on a makeshift raft and were never seen again. Security and upkeep proved prohibitively expensive, and finally the island prison was abandoned to the birds in 1963.\n\n  \nChief of Klamath River Hurok Indians of California Tim Williams addresses a crowd prior to Indian take-over of Alcatraz Island. © Ralph Crane/The LIFE Picture Collection via Getty Images\n\nThe American Indian Movement\nNative American activists claimed sovereignty over the island in the ’60s, noting that Alcatraz had long been used by the Ohlone as a spiritual retreat, yet federal authorities refused their proposal to turn Alcatraz into a Native American study center. Then, on the eve of Thanksgiving 1969, 79 Native American activists boated to the island and took it over.\nDuring the next 19 months, several thousand Native Americans and allies would join the occupying group Indians of All Tribes (IOAT) at Alcatraz. They agitated not only for abandoned federal lands to be returned to Indigenous tribes under a clause in the Treaty of Fort Laramie, but also for an end to the assimilatory Indian Termination policies that included abusive boarding schools and strategic erosion of tribal sovereignty. \n\n  \nIndigenous demonstrators inspect prison galleries in main cell block on Alcatraz Island during the occupation © Bettmann Archive / Getty Images\n\nThe Radio Free Alcatraz program, hosted by Santee Sioux John Trudell, used western broadcast networks to share information about the occupation and why Indigenous activists demanded self-determination. Public support for the burgeoning American Indian Movement grew, even garnering attention from celebrities like Jane Fonda and the rock band Creedence Clearwater Revival. Inspired by the work done at Alcatraz, other occupations took place nationwide, including at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. Still, logistical pressures including surveillance by the FBI and access to water, telephone service, and electricity (eventually cut off by the federal government) ultimately stymied the movement on The Rock.\nAfter the government removed the last Indigenous activists and regained control of the island, it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the national park service. By 1973, Alcatraz had already become a major tourist attraction. Today the cell blocks, ‘This Is Indian Land’ water-tower graffiti and rare wildlife are all part of the Alcatraz experience. Each Thanksgiving Day since 1975, an ‘Un-Thanksgiving’ ceremony has been held at dawn on Alcatraz, with Native leaders and supporters continuing to share their determination to reverse the course of colonial history. \n\n  \nOn August 17, 2020 Alcatraz Island reopened to the public for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic © Getty Images\n\nVisiting Alcatraz\nAlcatraz is open every day except Christmas, Thanksgiving and New Year's day. Advance tickets are recommended as it's such a popular attraction, particularly during peak season. A ferry cruise is required to reach Alcatraz from Piers 31-33 in downtown San Francisco, and the fee includes both transportation and entry.\nDay tours start at $25 for children, $41.00 for adults, and $38.65 for seniors. Family Packs good for 2 adults and 2 children are $119.60. Night tours, Behind The Scenes tours, and combination tours that include passage to Angel Island are also available. For ticket reservation call (415) 981-ROCK or go to www.alcatrazcruises.com. \nInterpretive materials are available in braille and American Sign Language for visitors who are visually impaired or deaf and hard of hearing. Assistive listening devices are available for visitors, as well, and there are also strategically placed tactile markers throughout Alcatraz's major sites, and close-captioning on film exhibits. An accessible tram is available to help those with impaired mobility navigate the island upon arrival. \n\n"

        "detail_description": "\nWhen Frederick Law Olmsted, architect of New York's Central Park, gazed in 1865 upon the plot of land San Francisco Mayor Frank McCoppin wanted to turn into a vast city park, he was understandably skeptical. Here was a swath of 1,013 acres of unlovely, dubious sand dunes on the outskirts of town, buffeted by powerful winds blowing in off the dark grey Pacific. The landscape architect turned down the job, despite the opportunity to create a park bigger than New York's before his first masterpiece was even finished.\nBut Olmstead would have to chuckle, and change his tune, a century later to see what Golden Gate Park became – from bonsai, buffalo, and redwoods to Frisbees, free music, and free spirits, when in the 1960s San Francisco's back yard became the epicenter of the Summer of Love. Today it still seems to contain just about everything its denizens love about their city.\nYou could wander the park for a week and still not see it all – but any given visit is a chance to walk through San Francisco history, from the park's oldest corners at its eastern end to where the park's borders give way to surf spots on the Pacific coast. \n\n  \nThe Spreckels Temple of Music in Golden Gate Park. ©V_E/Shutterstock\n\nWalk through history in Golden Gate Park\nThe creation of Golden Gate Park\nGolden Gate Park was the brain child of several local politicians angling to flip a piece of former Mexican territory on the outskirts of San Francisco into a profitable expansion of the growing city. Not the least of these city schemers was then-mayor Frank McCoppin, who saw an opportunity to not only give San Franciscans more elbow room while lining his own pockets on construction grift, but also solve a problem that had lead to lengthy legal battles – namely, the presence of well-to-do and opportunistic squatters trying to lay claim to the Outside Lands now that San Francisco's fortunes looked rosy. \nDespite Olmsted's assertion a park larger than New York's Central would never succeed on the proposed site, tenacious young civil engineer William Hammond Hall and master gardener John McLaren got to work. They had a unique vision for the time that would banish commercial eyesores like casinos, resorts, racetracks and an igloo village and instead showcase mother nature. It was an unorthodox view in an era when Central Park wasn't even yet complete, ten years before even such majestic and one-of-a-kind landscapes as Yellowstone would be preserved from development as national parks. \n\n  \nde young, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, California, USA. ©Checubus/Shutterstock\n\nWhat to do in Golden Gate Park\nUltimately, McCoppin, Hall and McLaren had their ways, producing a green space that \"feels wild....shaggy and labyrinthine and confusing,\" in the words of Gary Kimya, scholar of San Francisco history. Indeed, he wrote in Cool Grey City of Love: 49 Views of San Francisco that \"The paradox of Golden Gate Park is that its wildness is almost completely man-made. Every inch of the park had to be won. The loss of San Francisco's great sand dunes...is tragic...but [represents an] ultimately triumphant negotiation between man and the world.\"\nSeveral of Golden Gate Park's earliest features give teeth to that assessment. The Conservatory of Flowers, opened in 1879 and filled with rare specimens from South and Central America and aquatic Plants native to the Amazon. Stow Lake was created in 1893 with its picturesque Strawberry Hill, a favorite for families for over a hundred years.\n\n  \nJune 7, 2018: Japanese Tea Garden inside Golden Gate Park. ©Toms Auzins/Shutterstock\n\nThe Japanese Tea Garden is another early success – the oldest such public Japanese garden in the United States, it's been here since  the California Midwinter International Exposition of 1894. The carefully tended garden is full of imported plants, birds, and fish that have flourished for over a century in the once-inhospitable Outside Lands far from their native Nippon.\nIn 1906, nearly forty years after the dunes turned into a park larger than Olmstead's masterpiece, the devastating earthquake that shook San Francisco left thousands of refugees camping out in parks around the city, from Dolores Park in the Mission to Golden Gate Park. Some of the shacks built by the US Army to house earthquake victims were later moved to permanent lots, and are still in use today.\nAs the city recovered, several new institutions found a home in Golden Gate Park, including the including the Kezar Stadium (former home to the Oakland Raiders), California Academy of Sciences and the de Young Museum. The park's beloved Windmills bookended the earthquake, one built in 1903 and the other in 1908. The spiky Dahlia Garden appeared in the mid-1920s, as did the Shakespeare Garden with its collection of 200 plants mentioned in the Bard's writings.\n\n  \nThe Beach Chalet is located above the Golden Gate Park Visitor's Center and features historic WPA frescoes created by Lucien Labaudt in the 1930's celebrating the history of Golden Gate Park ©LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nThe WPA and the Summer of Love\nDuring the Great Depression, the Works Progress Administration was not only busy decorating Coit Tower with controversial murals, they were adding new features to Golden Gate Park, including the San Francisco Botanical Garden, the archery field, Anglers Lodge, and the Model Yacht Club. They also restored the 1926 art deco Horseshoe Pits, and built the Beach Chalet with its gorgeous frescos that tell the story of Golden Gate Park's construction.\nMost impressive, the Hoover Grove of giant sequoia were planted in 1930 to honor casualties from World War I, on the south edge of Martin Luther King Jr. Drive. Here you can peep these towering giants without driving out to the Marin Headlands and Muir Woods National Monument. So much for Olmstead's jab that \"There is not a full-grown tree of beautiful proportions near San Francisco.\"\nThe park's features and usages continued to evolve over the decades. Stow Lake's lovely boathouse was added in 1946. Twenty years later, in the Panhandle fringes of the park near Haight-Ashbury, the Human Be-In ushered in the Summer of Love, when thousands of youth were drawn to Hippie Hill by the promise of utopia fueled by free concerts from local bands and plentiful cannabis and LSD. Visit Golden Gate Park on April 20th of any given year (and, let's be honest, in certain pockets any day of the week) and you'll catch a whiff of the Hippie Hill scene from fifty years ago.\n\n  \nThe new Golden Gate Park ferris wheel, part of its 150 anniversary celebrations, arrived in 2020 and is one of the park's most sought-after new attractions © Xinhua News Agency/Getty Images\n\nGolden Gate Park today\nOne of the most recent permanent additions to Golden Gate Park is the National AIDS Memorial Grove. Built in 1991, it's a touching tribute to the millions of lives lost during the plague years, which hit San Francisco's queer community hard and left the city shaken after the dark 1980s.\nThat's not all, however. The park is still constantly evolving year to year. Today Golden Gate Park hosts events like the Bay to Breakers 12K race, as well as the Hardly Strictly Bluegrass and Outside Lands music festivals which take place every October. In December, the Christmas lights are a draw for families and visitors. \n\n  \nA festival takes place in Golden Gate Park in 2010 ©Eric Broder Van Dyke/Shutterstock\n\nIn 2020, the city celebrated the park's 150th anniversary with temporary art installations like local artist Charles Gadeken's Entwined light show in Peacock Meadow (240 John F Kennedy Drive). Another new addition to mark the anniversary was the SkyStar Wheel, Golden Gate Park's own ferris wheel that will be in place until March of 2025. That same year, protestors marked Juneteenth by toppling some of the park's historic statues, including those of Francis Scott Key, Padre Junipero Serra, and Ulysses S. Grant.\nOther changes during the COVID-19 pandemic have included the Golden Gate Park Sunday Roller Disco Party, a free community-led party for roller skaters at \"Skatin' Place,\" a spot near 6th Ave &amp; Kennedy Drive, most Sundays from noon to 5PM that features live DJs. \nKeep your eyes pealed during the summer months for one of the 12 pianos hidden around the Botanical Garden for anyone to play, part of an event called Flower Piano that includes free piano lessons, community sing-alongs at sunset, and more. \n\n  \nThe M.H. de Young bus stop; Shutterstock ID 3554606; your: Meghan O'Dea; gl: 65050; netsuite: Digital Editorial; full: golden gate park POI Shutterstock / Rafael Ramirez Lee\n\nGetting to Golden Gate Park\nAt over three miles long and half a mile long, there's a lot of ground to cover in Golden Gate Park, and a lot of entrances. The most popular entrance is in the Panhandle via Fell St, but coming in from 9th Avenue off Lincoln puts you right by some prime attractions.\nJFK serves as one of the main arteries in the park for cars, along with Transverse Drive, Chain of Lakes Drive, and 25th Ave/Crossover Drive/19th Ave/Park Presidio – these later streets are not part of the Slow Streets program the city has implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic to give San Franciscans more room to walk and bike away from crowds. Check the park website to see the latest on road closures for events and other initiatives. \n\n  \nGolden Gate park, San-Francisco, California, USA ©Akropot/Getty Images\n\nBiking, walking, and skating are all popular here. Numerous bus and trolly routes serve Golden Gate Park, too, and you'll find entry points lining the side of the park all the way around its perimeter. \nThe park is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There are restrooms sprinkled throughout the park, \nVehicle parking in Golden Gate Park\nThere are over 4,700 street parking spots throughout the park. Accessible parking is available at the McLaren Lodge, Music Concourse (behind Bandshell), MLK Drive &amp; Music Concourse and on JFK/Transverse Drive.\nThe 800-space Music Concourse garage ($33 for the day) as well as over 4,700 street parking spots throughout the park.

        "detail_description": "If you look close today at the clinker-brick buildings lining these narrow backstreets, past the temple balconies jutting out over bakeries, acupuncture clinics, barbershops, and travel agencies, you'll see a microcosm of the the American dream. San Francisco's storied Chinatown is the oldest in North America, and the largest off the Asian continent. For almost two hundred years, the 41 historic alleyways packed into Chinatown's 22 blocks have welcomed newcomers from every province, and been the stage for sometimes improbable stories of tenacity and resilience.\nSan Francisco's Chinatown history\nThe first Chinese immigrants arrived in San Francisco in 1848, drawn largely from the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong by the promise of good jobs. In just five years, almost 5,000 Chinese immigrants arrived in San Francisco – a lot of names for the switchboard operators at the Chinese Telephone Exchange to keep track of as the largely male population called home to their families on the other side of the Pacific. By the 1880s, the city's Chinatown had begun to coalesce near Portsmouth Square, and was already drawing not only immigrants craving the familiar sights, sounds, and scents of home but also curious tourists.\n\n  \nAn early Chinese American telephone operator minds the switchboards at the telephone exchange in San Francisco circa 1900 © Photo by Library of Congress/Corbis/VC Corbis/VCG via Getty Images\n\nStill, the backlash was swift when the city's demographics and economic fortunes shifted at the end of the 19th century and San Francisco blamed its woes on its newest citizens. As editor and historian Gary Kimya explains in Cool Grey City of Love: 49 Views of San Francisco, \"The movement to get rid of Chinatown began as soon as there was a Chinatown.\" A 1900 outbreak of bubonic plague followed up by the 1906 earthquake in San Francisco very nearly did the job.\nNot only did Chinatown literally rise from the ashes, however, it returned more Chinese than ever as residents collaborated with white architects and landlords to create new architectural styles that reflected the neighborhood's unique heritage. Chinatown may have had to grow up rather than out thanks to the limitations imposed by the Chinese exclusion laws first passed in the 1880s. Nowhere is this more evident than Waverly Place, one of San Francisco's most treasured Chinatown alleys. It's home to the Tin How Temple – the oldest surviving Taoist temple in San Francisco, which has been welcoming worshipers since 1852. \n\n  \nA banner on Grant Street, San Francisco, welcomes visitors to Chinatown in the 1950s © Photo by Orlando /Three Lions/Getty Images\n\nContemporary Chinatown\nStill, San Franciscans had to admit Chinatown's alleyways offered something special that couldn't be found anywhere else, wether it was booze in Spofford Alley during Prohibition, nightlife at legendary clubs like Forbidden City, or brand-new \"Chinese\" dishes invented stateside in California kitchens like chop suey and moo goo gai pan. Indeed, some of San Francisco's most beloved haunts have been part of Chinatown for over a hundred years, including Mister Jiu's, which has been serving up mouth-watering banquets sine the 1880s; Hang Ah Tea Room, the oldest dim sum restaurant in the United States; and Sam Wo Restaurant, a late-night mainstay that's been open since 1912 and charmed Beat generation luminaries from neighboring North Beach like Allen Ginsberg and Charles Bukowski.\nDespite the huge cultural impact the Chinese community has made on San Francisco, there continue to be battles to fight. Activists and politicians like Rose Pak, Ed Lee, and Gordon Chin have fought hard since the 1970s against the steady tide of gentrification to keep the Chinatown district affordable. Indeed, Chin founded the Chinatown Community Development Center that's continued to build affordable housing and keep long-time residents in the neighborhood. Now many of those elders are experiencing a fresh wave of anti-Asian sentiment and violence in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, painfully recalling the last century's scapegoating of Chinese immigrants for the Barbary Plague. \n\n  \nThe Dragon Gate south entrance to Chinatown in San Francisco, California, USA. ©James Au/Alamy Stock Photo\n\nSan Francisco Chinatown parking and what to do\nIf you've got a yen to experience San Francisco's vibrant Chinatown for yourself, leave you vehicle at the Good Luck Parking Garage and be sure to snap a photo by the Dragon's Gate, which was gifted by Taiwan in 1970. One of the best ways to get oriented is setting off on one of the Chinatown Alleyway Tours and Chinatown Heritage Walking Tours that offer community-supporting, time-traveling strolls through defining moments in American history.\nThe later are hosted by the Chinese Culture Center, which also offers everything from art classes to Mandarin lessons and genealogy services. Visitors can also take in the rotating exhibits at the Chinese Historical Society of America, which was founded in the 1960s as a new wave of Chinese immigrants arrived largely from Hong Kong. Don't miss the magical mosaic mural at Wentworth Place, either – it's one of the Chinatown alleyways most dazzling sights. \nFor the full Chinatown experience, time your visit for the Lunar New Year, when the neighborhood's winding alleys are lit up by lanterns and firecrackers as crowds pack in to see the lion dances and parade floats go by. For a real treat, duck into the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory at 56 Ross Alley to see how the classic treats are made by hand – and even crunch into some hot off the cast iron griddle. \n"

        "detail_description": "Was it the fall of 1966 or the winter of ’67? As the Haight saying goes, if you can remember the Summer of Love, you probably weren’t here. The fog was laced with pot, sandalwood incense and burning military draft cards, entire days were spent contemplating trippy Grateful Dead posters, and the corner of Haight and Ashbury Streets became the turning point for an entire generation. The Haight's counterculture kids called themselves freaks and flower children; San Francisco Chronicle columnist Herb Caen dubbed them 'hippies.'\nThe history of the Haight goes back over sixty years before the Summer of Love heated up, however. The neighborhood's beautiful Victorian Painted Ladies were spared by the 1906 earthquake that wrecked and burned so much of San Francisco. Over the decades that followed, however, these once-gleaming single family homes were weathered by the Great Depression, split up into apartments during World War II, and nearly flattened by a proposed freeway in the 1950s. But in the decline, the seeds of counterculture had already been sewn. \n\n  \nThe pretty pink house where Janis Joplin lived briefly in the 1960s © Meghan O'Dea / Lonely Planet\n\nThe '60s in Haight-Ashbury\nAs David Talbot notes in his San Francisco history Season of the Witch, by the time the Golden Gate Park's Panhandle was threatened by the wheels of progress (and commuter's automobiles), the Haight was full of misfit residents used to providing one another support, and who were open to embracing new, diverse ideas. Here were Black homeowners sick of disenfranchisement, Beat poets priced out of gentrifying North Beach, members of the queer community spilling out of the Castro, and fired up students who had learned the art of activism on Freedom Rides in the southeast. City Hall didn't stand a chance against the Haight.\nIt was a place to find your people, and soon a new generation of young artists started moving in to now-iconic homes that continue to draw rock 'n' roll pilgrims. The Grateful Dead House became a major hub at 710 Ashbury. The legendary Hells Angels bikers were posted up practically next door at 715, while Janis Joplin briefly stowed her feather boas a block down the street at 635. 1090 Page Street was home to Joplin's backing band, Big Brother and the Holding Company (though now it's a block of condos). Cult leader Charles Manson briefly brought his \"family\" to 636 Cole, while Jefferson Airplane filled up the sprawling mansion at 2400 Fulton with Grace Slick's big voice. Meanwhile, Jimmi Hendrix wrote \"Red Door\" about his apartment at 1524A Haight Street. \n\n  \nAuthor Tom Wolfe talks with Jerry Garcia of the Grateful Dead and the band's manager Rock Scully under the street signs on the corner of Ashbury and Haight streets © Corbis via Getty Images\n\nDrugs poured in, including LSD, speed, and cannabis. So did plenty of youth from around the country eager to get away from mainstream America and experience the burgeoning counterculture first hand. The neighborhood's growing transient population would crash at rooming houses like the Red Victorian – a former hotel that was best known at the time as Jeffrey Haight – or at the apartments of acquaintances, or in Golden Gate Park. The Diggers, a radical anarchist and performance art collective, helped support the Haight's down-and-out with a network of free housing flops, health clinics, soup kitchens, clothing swaps, and artistic \"happenings\" thrown in collaboration with a carousel of hippie bands, dancers, and creatives, and especially the Grateful Dead.\nIt was a creative, open scene many feel nostalgia for – though not without its dark side. Writer Joan Didion arrived in 1967 to report on the Haight-Ashbury scene for The Saturday Evening Post and observed not the hippie utopia so many young people were searching for, but a crumbling jumble of lost drug-users who included, harrowingly, a five year old under the influence of LSD. In many ways Didion's essay predicted the rough decline into hard drugs and dilapidation that even the well-intentioned social network of Diggers and community activists couldn't hold back.\n\n  \nModern Haight Ashbury blends a variety of architectural and cultural eras into a neighborhood still compelling for locals and visitors alike © Meghan O'Dea / Lonely Planet\n\nHaight-Ashbury today\nThe neighborhood gentrified throughout the 1980s, and many of the stately homes were restored. Today, the Haight is a mix of businesses old and new that reflect both its hippie legacy and the changing flavor of tech-era San Francisco. Still, flashbacks of all sorts remain a given in the Haight, which still has its swinging-’60s tendencies.\nSpots like the indie Booksmith, Amoeba Music, and Magnolia Brewery, not to mention hazy outdoor hideaways like Hippie Hill, and Buena Vista Park, still hold a torch for the neighborhood's countercultural vibes. So do annual events like the Haight-Ashbury Street Fair. But you can also get a taste of how time has marched on at restaurants like Alembic, home to inventive fare like jerk-spiced duck hearts that you'd never find on The Diggers' menus. Or you can go even further back in time at Aub Zam Zam, a cash-only joint with jazz on the juke that's been pleasing the Haight since 1941.\nVisit Haight-Ashbury today and you'll find the fog remains fragrant downwind of neighborhood cannabis dispensaries, and that tie-dye and ideals have never entirely gone out of fashion here – hence the prized vintage rock tees on the wall at Wasteland, organic-farming manuals in their umpteenth printing at Bound Together Anarchist Book Collective, and judgment-free treatment for bad trips and unfortunate itches at the Haight-Ashbury Free Clinic. At the corner of Haight and Cole, see you how far humanity has come in Joana Zegri's 1967 Evolution Rainbow mural, showing life forms evolving from the Pleistocene era to the Age of Aquarius. Who knows what the Haight will get into next.\n \n"

From the Aztec serpent-god Quetzalcoatl who occupies 24th &amp; York Mini Park to the \"Maestrapeace\" that covers the facade of the Women's Building to the tags and other spray painted ephemera that pop up on shops' roll-down doors overnight, the Mission is a living, breathing public art museum. But few corners of the Mission are quite so painted, or celebrated, as Balmy Alley.\n\n  \n\"Naya Bihana\" by Martin Travers located in Balmy Alley © Photo by Bruno PEROUSSE/Gamma-Rapho via Getty Images\n\nThis strip off of 24th Street sits parallel to Treat Ave and Harrison Street between 24th &amp; 25th, and for almost fifty years it's been home to works by Chicano artists that build on a long tradition of murialismo, an artistic movement that has roots in pre-Hispanic Central American cultures and which swelled in significance and prevalence after the Mexican revolution both in its countries of origin and in El Norte.\nThe Balmy Alley murals have a wide range of subject matter, from a memorial for El Salvador activist Archbishop Óscar Romero to a homage to great female artists including Frida Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe. Some of the oldest surviving works like \"The Primal Sea\" at the Garfield Pool at Harrison and 26th Street and artists Miranda Bergman and O'Brien Thiele's \"Culture Contains the Seed of Resistance that Blossoms into the Flower of Liberation\" have undergone recent restoration, too, giving visitors a chance to see how the Mission's unique take on murialismo has evolved over time.\n\n  \nMurals along Balmy Alley. ©Sabrina Dalbesio/Lonely Planet\n\nHow to see the Mission District murals\nTo reach Balmy Avenue, take BART to 24th/Mission. Walk east towards Capp Street for 5 1/2 blocks.\nNonprofit Precita Eyes runs muralist-led tours each weekend that cover 60 to 70 murals within a six- to 10-block radius of Balmy Alley. The organization itself dates back to 1977, when Susan and Luis Cervantes established the muralists association to create accessible public art and provide not-for-profit arts education. Precita Eyes was working in the Mission when Balmy Alley first started filling up with work thanks to art collectives like Mujeres Muralistas and the PLACA project, and have seen (and participated) first-hand how Balmy has evolved in the decades since.\nTours typically cost $20 for adults, $15 for San Francisco residents, $10 for seniors and college students, $6 for teens, and $3 for children under 12. \nEdible Excursions offers a food and art tour along 24th Street. The three hour tour highlights the rich culinary scene in The Mission, with a chance to take in the Balmy murals, too. This tour takes place on Saturdays from 11am and costs $125 per person.\n\n  \nMuralismo in the 1970s often focused on Central American politics, while more recent murals touch on topical issues facing the Chicano community, like gentrification and racial justice © Photo by Carol M. Highsmith/Buyenlarge/Getty Images\n\nThe history of the Balmy Alley murals\nThe 1970s were a turbulent time in San Francisco. A group of Indigenous activists called Indians of All Tribes (IAT) had taken over Alcatraz, student groups were protesting the Vietnam War, the Castro had become the capital of LGBTQIA+ America, and fierce battles were waged downtown over affordable housing in ethnic enclaves like Chinatown as new skyscrapers shot up in the financial district. Marginalized communities were finding their voices like never before, and transforming the city in the process.\nAmidst it all, the Chicano movement was swelling, especially in traditionally Latino neighborhoods like the Mission District. Soon, the rising sense of chicanismo would change the face of the barrio itself, filling the Mission with colorful murals that tapped into a long artistic tradition of murialismo, as well as San Francisco's well established yen for political agitation.\n\n  \n\"Mural After the Storm\" by Tina Wolfe is one of the newer works located in Balmy Alley ©Photo by Carol M. Highsmith/Buyenlarge/Getty Images\n\nSan Francisco wasn't new to murialismo. After all, the city had embraced Diego Rivera's 1931 Allegory of California, a fresco at the Stock Exchange Lunch Club that was a gentle reflection of Rivera's anti-capitalist principles. But by the 1970s, the Mission District's emerging school of murialismo would reflect forty years of evolving discourse on Chicano identity, as well as the experiences of a new generation of Central American refugees and immigrants who were trying to rebuild their lives in San Francisco.\nIn 1970, Chicana artists Patricia Rodriquez and Graciela Carillo met at the San Francisco Art Institute, and by 1974 the two formed Mujeres Muralistas (the women muralists). The project was radical both for the artists' gender and the way they brought domestic and ecological themes into a school of art that was often more overtly political.\n\n  \n\"Those We Love, We Remember\" by Edythe Boone has been part of Balmy Alley since 1995 ©Anthony Pidgeon/Lonely Planet\n\nSoon Rodriquez and Carillo were joined by Venezuelan-born Consuelo Mendez and fellow Chicana Irene Perez. Mujeres Muralistas kicked off new large-format works in Balmy Alley behind where Rodriquez and Carillo were living, close to where thought-provoking murals by Mia Gonzalez and Susan Kelk Cervantez that had cropped up a year before. \nIt didn't take long before these women's work was galvanized into a movement to transform the political landscape one mural at a time. Artist Ray Patlan started the PLACA project, the name a reference to Spanish slang for graffiti or mark-making. With grant money, PLACA brought together dozens of artists to paint murals protesting United States' Regan-era incursion into Central American politics and the plight of people displaced from Nicaragua, El Salvador, Guatamala, and Honduras.\n\n  \nA detail from \"Enrique Journey\" by artist Josue Rojas, one of the Balmy Alley murals that addresses contemporary politics © Photo by Carol M. Highsmith/Buyenlarge/Getty Images\n\nMany of those murals were centered in and around Balmy Alley as well, firmly establishing that corner of the Mission as the epicenter of a bold new chapter in both murialismo and San Francisco's local art scene. Within a few years, artist René Yañez, who was previously instrumental in the formation of the Mexican-American Liberation Art Front (MALAF), became involved in San Francisco's Neighborhood Arts Program, which helped fund even more murals in the Mission.\nEventually the movement that began in Balmy spread to other corners of the neighborhood , too, and even inspired similar groundswells of more diverse, inclusive, and dynamic murialismo in cities throughout the United States. The work of these groundbreaking artists has been honored and explored in documentaries, books, and fine arts programs hosted by the De Young museum and SFMOMA, and continues to shape one of San Francisco's best-beloved neighborhoods.\n"

Today, the Sphinx statue outside is one of the few remnants of the Egyptian revival architecture that contained the museum's early, eclectic assortment of anthropological artifacts and artworks.\nRedesigned after the 1906 earthquake by Louis Christian Mullgardt, the de Young reemerged in 1919 freshly renamed in honor of the co-founder of the San Francisco Chronicle who'd championed the museum in its early years, as well as the park in which it was situated.\n\n  \nde young, Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, California, USA. ©Checubus/Shutterstock\n\nWhat to see and what's on\nThe de Young's collections grew to include examples of US, African, Oceanic, South and Central American, and graphic art, as well as textiles and photography from around the world. Its European art collection was shifted to the Legion of Honor in the 1970s, creating more room for Indigenous art from a number of different global cultures. \nToday you can see both the de Young's permanent collection offer as well as special exhibitions that take a deep dive into its archives like the The Turkmen Storage Bag collection, as well as visiting shows like the sold out Calder-Picasso exhibit and Runway of Love, an exhibit of Black fashion designer Patrick Kelly's garments that explored expressions of race and queer identity.\n\n  \nEvan Hirsch speaks during The Summer of Love Experience: Art, Fashion, and Rock &amp; Roll at the deYoung © AFP via Getty Images\n\nAdmission and free days at the de Young\nThe museum is open from 9:30AM to 5:15PM Tuesday through Sunday, and costs $15 for adults, $12 for seniors over 65, $6 for students, and is free for anyone under 17. Receive a $2 discount with proof of purchase from any Bay Area public transportation system, including BART, Muni, Caltrain, and more.\nThrough December 2021, Essential and Frontline workers are eligible for free admission.

        "detail_description": "No one could have predicted the cultural force City Lights would become when it first opened in 1953. Sure, it had a proletarian ethos suggested by its founders decision to name the shop for a Charlie Chaplin film and sell only paperback books. And its initial owner, professor Peter Martin, certainly had an impeccable pedigree for the blend of publishing and progressive politics that would establish City Lights as an opponent of censorship and bastion of free speech.\nMartin was the son of Carlo Tresca, an Italian anarchist and publisher of socialist newspapers who married the sister of American Civil Liberties Union founder Elizabeth Gurley Flynn. But even after Martin was joined as co-owner by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti and book-clerk-cum-manager Shigeyoshi Murao, the shop easily could have remained a quiet mainstay of the North Beach beat scene.\nCity Lights and Allen Ginsberg\nThat changed in 1955 when Martin sold his shares and moved back to New York City, where his father had been assassinated ten years earlier. Left to his own devices, Ferlinghetti decided to start a small press called City Lights Publishing that would produce the Pocket Poets Series, featuring some of Ferlinghetti's own work and that of other beatnicks who read at open mic nights hosted by venues like the now-defunct Six Gallery. One of those new voices was a twenty eight year old poet named Allen Ginsberg, whose epic poem Howl got both Ferlinghetti and Murao arrested for printing and selling obscene materials. \n\n  \nAmerican poet and activist Lawrence Ferlinghetti poses outside the bookstore he co-founded in September 1977. © Photo by Janet Fries/Getty Images\n\n\nThe ensuing trial and landmark 1957 ruling in favor of free speech put the beats, and City Lights, on the national map – quite literally. Soon tourists began popping by, eager to experience San Francisco's burgeoning new counterculture movement for themselves. Over time, City Lights continued to published writers who pushed the envelope of political and philosophic thought and literary form, including titles by Angela Davis, Diane di Prima, Frank O'Hara, and Noam Chomsky, proving the point on one of Ferlinghetti's hand-lettered signs: 'Printer's Ink Is the Greater Explosive.' \nThe North Beach beats\nCity Lights also steadily took over space in its funny triangular building as neighboring businesses moved out, expanding into a cellar that was once the lair of the paper dragon used in Chinatown's Lunar New Year celebrations, and where enigmatic slogans on the walls like 'I am the door' were left behind by a cult that worshipped here in the 1930s. That cellar became one of City Lights' themed rooms, and home to nonfiction tomes unconventionally organized by book buyer Paul Yamazaki according to counter-cultural themes like Stolen Continents, Muckraking, and Commodity Aesthetics. Feel free to enjoy some idle browsing, a past time highly encouraged at City Lights – indeed, another of Ferlinghetti's signs describes City Lights as 'A Kind of Library Where Books Are Sold.'\n\n  \nA man reads a book at the City Lights Bookstore © Getty Images\n\nVisitors from around the world recognize the truth of this statement: City Lights remains a door to new ideas and continuing revelations. Though Ferlinghetti passed away in late February of 2021 at the age of 101, the publishing arm of the business he built continues to give paper and platform to writers often shut out of traditional publishing, including Latinx and Chicanx voices, LGBTQIA+ authors, and death row inmates. \nSo come by, load up on zines on the mezzanine, entertain radical ideas downstairs in the new Pedagogies of Resistance section, and curl up in the designated Poet’s Chair upstairs overlooking Vesuvio Cafe, where Ferlinghetti and Murao once held court with contemporaries like Jack Kerouac, Dylan Thomas, and Bob Dylan. For almost seventy years now, this San Francisco treasure has truly been a place where, as Ferlinghetti put it, the public is \"invited, in person and in books, to participate in that 'great conversation' between authors of all ages, ancient and modern.\" \nHow to visit City Lights Booksellers\nCity Lights is open seven days a week from 10 AM to midnight. It can be reached on the 8X or the 41 Union buses to Columbus &amp; Broadway, or via the 30 Stockton or 45 Union/Stockton buses to Stockton &amp; Broadway. The nearest Muni stop is Montgomery Station. Metered street parking is available nearby, while there are parking garages near Portsmouth Square and at 735 Valejo. Further across the border into Chinatown, Good Luck Parking Garage is a fun option to try.\nThe bookshop also hosts weekly author readings – though the rotation has been taken online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. check City Light's social media accounts on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter for regular updates as to what digital readings are happening and when in-person events are back on.\n"

When Trinity's congregation moved, Grace took over the grand space that earned it the nickname Grace Cathedral. Unfortunately, that church was destroyed along with much of the city in the 1906 earthquake. The congregation moved into temporary quarters, and it wasn't until 1928 that work began on a new cathedral on Nob Hill, the land donated by the prominent Crocker family. \nThat structure took decades to complete, hampered by the Great Depression and stop-and-start fundraising efforts. The last tower crowned the cathedral in 1964, and since then the church has steadily added new interior embellishments that reflect its mission to create an inclusive spiritual community.\n\n  \nOne of the frescos in Grace Cathedral that depict San Francisco's history ©  Shutterstock / kross13\n\nAs you work your way through the nave, keep your eyes peeled the 'Human Endeavor' series of stained glass windows dedicated to science, depicting Albert Einstein uplifted in swirling nuclear particles. San Francisco history unfolds on murals that depict major events from the 1906 earthquake to the 1945 UN charter signing.

        "detail_description": "\nPicture what it was like to be Chinese in America during the gold rush, transcontinental railroad construction, and Beat heyday in this 1932 landmark, originally built as Chinatown's YWCA. CHSA historians unearth fascinating artifacts: 1920s silk qipao dresses, WWII Chinatown nightclub posters, and Frank Wong's Chinatown miniatures.\nExhibits share personal insights and historical perspectives on Chinese American historical milestones.\nWhat to see at the Chinese Historical Society of America\nThe CHSA has a rich permanent collection that includes records on such diverse topics as the history of Chinese railroad workers, the portrayal of Chinese Americans in 19th and 20th century pop culture, the role of Chinese Americans in World War II, and more local fare like an exhibit on the stereotype-smashing 1940s Kublai Khan nightclub.\nOne of the especial treasures at the CHSA are Frank Wong's beloved miniatures, which portray scenes of Chinatown with the same care the artist gave to his work as a set designer on productions like Magnum PI. \nPast exhibits have explored fashion, genealogy, the feminist movement for Chinese American women, and the slow, hard-won expansion of the Chinese American community in the Outer Sunset District of San Francisco.\n\n  \nA banner on Grant Street, San Francisco, welcomes visitors to Chinatown in the 1950s © Orlando /Three Lions/Getty Images\n\nWhen to visit\nThe CHSA is open at 965 Clay Street Wednesday-Sunday 11am - 4pm. Admission is $12 for adults, $10 for seniors, students and military veterans, and $5 for children under 18.\nActive military and their families receive free admission between Memorial and Labor Day. California library card holders can also get free admission. \nTours are offered every 1st and 3rd Saturday of the month, free with admission, and start at 11:15am. \nYou can reach the CHSA by bus or cable car at the Clay and Powell stop, or at Stockton between Sacramento and Clay. Parking is available at Portsmouth Square, or at the Good Luck Parking Garage half a mile away at 735 Vallejo if you don't mind a stroll through Chinatown – it'll take you past the Golden Gate Fortune Cookie Factory.\n\n  \nThe first Chinese American telephone operator in Chinatown works at the Chinese Telephone Exchange in San Francisco © Photo by Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images\n\nThe Chinese Historical Society of America founding\nIt was in the midst of the Civil Rights Movement that the Chinese Historical Society of America was founded to give voice to  Chinese Americans nationwide whose experience in the United States had largely been overlooked by mainstream scholarship.\nWhen the CHSA started its work, the 1965 immigration reform law that would allow a new generation of Asian immigrants into the United States was still two years off. There were just 250,000 Chinese Americans in the whole United States, and San Francisco's Chinatown was still a decade away from the housing reform movement that would give young leaders like Rose Pak, Ed Lee, and others a voice in city politics.\nStill, there was a lot of history to sift through, reaching back to the days of the tong street gangs that ruled during Prohibition and into records from the family associations lining Waverly Place that welcomed newly emigrated families to Chinatown and community hubs like the Tin How Temple.\n\n  \nThe blended architectural styles seen throughout San Francisco's Chinatown emerged after the 1906 earthquake, helping cement the neighborhood as a landmark ©photo.ua/Shutterstock\n\nThe former Chinatown YWCA\nEven the graceful clinker-brick, green-tile-roofed landmark building in which the CHSA eventually settled has a rich history to explore. Designed by trailblazing architect Julia Morgan (chief architect of Hearst Castle), the former YWCA incorporated Chinese architectural motifs into a sturdy, fireproof building – an example of the uniquely American architectural style that evolved out of the rubble of San Francisco's Chinatown after the 1906 earthquake and helped make the district a tourist attraction for decades to come. \n \n\n"

        "detail_description": "If you want to really see San Francisco, head to Coit Tower, a 1933 art deco beaut designed by Arthur Brown, Jr. and Henry Howard that sits high up on Telegraph Hill. San Fran scribe Gary Kamiya once described Coit Tower as \"the best 60-second walk I know,\" noting that in the minute it takes to circumnavigate Coit's base from the southwest you will see \"Chinatown, Nob Hill, Russian Hill, the Golden Gate Bridge, Alcatraz and the Embarcadero, Berkeley, the Bay Bridge and Oakland, Mount Diablo, the South Bay, the Ferry Building, and the entire Financial District, with a piece of Mount San Bruno and Bernal Heights in the Distance.\"\nPhew. Of course, that depends on San Francisco's signature fog not obscuring the view. \nCoit Tower may look sleek and graceful from afar, but the truth is it's just as quirky as the rest of San Francisco. The tower was funded by, and named for, philanthropist Lillie Hitchcock Coit. A rich eccentric nicknamed 'Firebelle Lil', Coit had a deep fascination with and appreciation for firefighters ever since she was a teenager. In her will, she set aside funds to beautify San Francisco, which the city used to build a memorial to firefighters in Washington Square Park as well as Coit Tower.\n\n  \nIn a funny bit of serendipity, this detail of City Life by Victor Arnautoff includes a billboard for the Charlie Caplin film City Lights. 20 years after this mural was painted, beat poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti would co-found his famous bookstore, naming it for the same film. © Robert Holmes/CORBIS/Corbis via Getty Images\n\nThe Coit Towers mural controversy\nA year after the tower was completed, the Public Works of Art Project (part of President Roosevelt’s New Deal) added a series of murals celebrating California workers. 25 local artists were selected, including Bernard Zakheim, Clifford Wight, Victor Arnautoff and John Langley Howard. The later four shared an admiration of Diego Rivera, whose Allegory of California Fresco in San Francisco was a point of hometown pride. Indeed, Rivera himself had trained Arnautoff – an intellectual and artistic affinity that perhaps makes what happened next less of a surprise. \nIn a mixup that has since taken on a life of its own in local legend, several of the completed murals became lightening rods of controversy when the public noticed that communist party symbols, Marxist slogans, and IWW mottos appeared in their backgrounds. Throw in a strike of longshoresmen and Teamsters that coincidentally occurred around the same time, and a hefty dose of moral panic, the public became convinced that Coit Tower was awash in anti-capitalist propaganda. It caused such a stir that Coit Tower was closed down for several months and two of the murals were amended. \n\n  \nAerial of Coit Tower and downtown San Francisco during sunset. ©Matt Moldenhauer/Shutterstock\n\nThe Tower's reputation did bounce back eventually and today it's one of best-beloved San Francisco landmarks. It's appeared in numerous movies and TV shows, including Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 love letter to San Francisco, Vertigo; 1971 Clint Eastwood film Dirty Harry; and Amazon Prime's prestige series The Man in the High Castle. Indeed, there's a bit of an urban legends that asserts Hitchcock insisted including the Coit Tower in Vertigo because he was a distant relation of Firebelle Lil – though it's ultimately just a myth.\nHow to visit Coit Tower\nTo reach Coit Tower take Muni bus 39 from Fisherman’s Wharf. Alternately, you can hike up the famous Filbert Street Steps and say hello to Telegraph Hill's resident parrots along the way. It's free to take Kamiya's advice and stroll around the tower's base, but to ride the elevator to the top will cost you a small fee.\nThere are different rates for locals and visitors, with adult tickets varying between $7 and $9, respectively. Seniors over 62 and teens ages 12-17 are $4 and $6 depending on residency. Children from 5-11 are $2 and $3. Visitors may also book a docent-led mural tour which costs $8 and lasts thirty to forty minutes. You'll have a chance to learn more about the murals, as well as the Public Works of Art Project and the 25 local artists themselves. \n \n"

Right in the middle of Golden Gate Park, architect Renzo Piano's 2008 landmark LEED-certified green building houses over 45,000 animals in a four-story rainforest, split-level aquarium and planetarium, all under a 'living roof' of wildflowers.\nInside, butterflies flit around in the glass Osher Rainforest Dome, penguins waddle in the African Hall within the Kimball Natural History Museum, and Claude the albino alligator stalks the mezzanine swamp in the Steinhart Aquarium. Kids also dig the aquarium's basement, where they can duck inside a glass bubble to enter an Eel Garden, find Dorys in the tropical fish tanks and pet starfish in the hands-on Discovery Tidepool.\nDon't miss the fun ongoing exhibits like Giants of Land and Sea, where you can brave an earthquake simulation, virtually climb a redwood and get lost in a fog room. Another hit is the California Coast exhibit, where you can watch divers swim through a replica of the Gulf of the Farallones National Marine Sanctuary right in San Francisco's own backyard. \n\n  \nClaude, a rare albino alligator, sits in the Swamp area of the California Academy of Sciences © Photo b Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAfter hours at California Academy of Sciences\nAfter the penguins nod off to sleep, the wild rumpus starts with different after-hours programs for all ages.\nEvery Thursday night from 6-10 pm, adults get a crack at the museum kid-free with a special 21+ NightLife event that features rainforest-themed cocktails and live DJs to encourage strange mating rituals. Tickets cost $15-$17.50 and should be purchased at least a day in advance.\nFor the littles, museum Sleepovers are a chance to combine penguins, pajamas, and a private planetarium show. The events last from 6PM until 8AM and include an overnight stay in one of the exhibit areas, a late night snack, an early morning breakfast, and admission to the Academy the following day. Sleepovers are open to children ages 5-17, who must be accompanied by an adult chaperone.\n\n  \nThe California Academy of Sciences is one of the oldest museums in the state ©Anton_Ivanov/Shutterstock\n\nHow to visit the California Academy of Sciences\nThe California Academy of Science is open to the public from 9:30AM until 5PM Monday through Saturday, and 11AM to 5PM on Sunday. Members get a little extra time to explore as a perk, from 8:30-9:30AM on Tuesdays and 10-11AM on Sundays.\nDaytime admissions prices include access to the entire Academy, and vary by date, entry time, and age group, as the museum has implemented timed, ticketed entry since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. That also means you should make a reservation in advance. Check ahead of time to see if any exhibits will be temporarily closed as phased reopening unfurls. \n\n  \nKids looking at Macaw in the Rainforests of the World dome at California Academy of Sciences. ©Sabrina Dalbesio/Lonely Planet\n\nBecause the Academy is within Golden Gate Park, it's pretty easy to access via public transit. The 44 O'Shaughnessy MUNI is the most convenient – it stops right in front of the museum. The 5 Fulton, 7 Haight, and North Judah Metro are other options, as well as Golden Gate Park's own shuttle system. \nBike parking is available outside the museum, and the Music Concourse Garage is available for car parking, though it can fill up at peak times. The Garage costs $5.25 per hour on weekdays and $6.25 per hour on weekends or after 5:30PM. Metered street parking is also available.\n\n  \nCalifornia Academy of Sciences. ©Sabrina Dalbesio/Lonely Planet\n\nAccessibility at the Academy\nMost of the Academy is accessible for visitors with mobility impairments, though you will need to proceed to the third floor accessible entrance for the planetarium, and request an accessible seat in the Forum Theater. \nVisitors with visual impairments can request readers and specially trained tour guides at least two weeks in advance, or you may bring your own interpreter without paying an additional admission fee. Deaf and hard of hearing visitors can also request sign-language interpreters at least two weeks in advance, including for planetarium and Forum Theater presentations.\nYou may also request a first-come, first-served Sensory Kit from the coat check clerk, which includes accessories designed to make the exhibits more accessible for visitors with extra sensory sensitivities. Like the SFMOMA, the Academy also offers a Sensory Guide which helps clarify which parts of the museum may be more or less stimulating for neurodivergent visitors.\n\n"

        "detail_description": "The Mission District has a long history of street art and muralismo – an oft-political school of public art prevalent throughout South and Central America and US cities with a robust Latino community – and Clarion Alley is one colorful place to check out the scene(ry) for yourself. \nClarion Alley, which sits at between Mission Street and Valencia Street for one block between 17th and 18th Street, has been a destination since the early 1990s. That's when the Clarion Alley Mural Project (CAMP) was founded by artists Aaron Noble, Michael O'Connor, Sebastiana Pastor, Rigo 92, Mary Gail Snyder, and Aracely Soriano.\n\n  \nColourful Murals in Clarion Alley, Mission District. ©Federica Grassi/Getty Images\n\nCAMP wanted to pick up what art collectives like Mujeres Muralistas and the PLACA project jumpstarted in nearby Balmy Alley in the 1980s, continuing to explore Chicano identity and the political struggles in Central America during the Reagan years, though also bringing even more local flavor into their work.\nCAMP aren't the only artists operating in Clarion Alley. Local creatives routinely update the walls of the structures that back up to the alley, ranging from a former IWW meeting hall and blocks of newly constructed condos. Their work reflects concerns about that kind of gentrification, as well as contemporary political and social justice movements with regular turnover. \n\n  \nWhile the Balmy Alley mural project focused on the theme of Central American struggle, the stated goals of Clarion were social inclusiveness and aesthetic variety © Rocket via Getty Images\n\nThough there was crossover between the two corners of the Mission District that involved influential figures like Precita Eyes co-founder Susan Cervantes, these new artists diverted from the early Balmy Alley style. They took on less of the social realist style influenced by Diego Rivera's 1931 Allegory of California and instead continued to delve into subjects and imagery inspired by comic books, hip hop, and personal observations from around the barrio, truly giving the neighborhood a voice as part of an egalitarian art movement. \nSome of the first works in Clarion Alley have survived for decades, however, respected by the artists presently working the walls. Those including paintings by Chuy Campusano (who was mentored in the 9170s by Rivera's assistant Emmy Lou Packard), Scott Williams, and Julie Murray, as well as Megan Wilson's daisy-covered \"Tax the Rich\" or Jet Martinez' glimpse of Clarion Alley inside a forest spirit.\nIf you haven't been coming here for years, it can be hard to distinguish what's new and what's a Gen X original – but that's the beauty of Clarion Alley. It's a living text, a library of Mission District experiences, telling this community's story palimpsest. \n"

Although the grassy expanses are mostly populated by relaxing hipsters, political protests and other favorite local sports do happen from time to time, and there are free movie nights and mime troupe performances in summer.\nDolores Park certainly has a storied history that demonstrates the diversity and rapidly shifting fortunes, that have defined San Francisco since it was founded. Once the site of an Indigenous Yelamu village called Chutchui, these parcels later were used as a cemetery by two of the oldest Jewish congregations in the United States. The graves were eventually moved elsewhere as the city grew, after which Dolores Park was briefly used as a staging ground by Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus before the land was sold to the city in 1905.\n\n  \nDolores Park is a popular place for activities that range from picnics to protests ©Katherine Papera / EyeEm/Getty Images\n\nJust a year later, San Francisco's 1906 earthquake and fire violently interrupted park planning, and it remained bumpy, squishy and poorly drained until its 2015 regrading. At the corner of 20th and Church Streets, note the golden fire hydrant: this little fireplug was the Mission's main water source during the 1906 earthquake and fire, and stopped the fire from spreading south of 20th Street.\nThat's not the only role Mission Dolores Park played in San Francisco's most famous natural disaster. This is where thousands of displaced families lives in temporary shacks and tents while the city was rebuilt. Until the 1920s, what is now a children's playground was a public swimming pool. It was initially built in 1909 in hopes that new amenities might help neighborhood residents forget Dolores Park's years as a refugee camp and reconsider it as a green space for recreation.\n\n  \nThe Mexican Liberty Bell is a reminder of the Mexican city with which Dolores Park shares a name © Photo by Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket via Getty Images\n\nSome of the park's other features, however, have had more staying power. There's a statue of Miguel Hildago, a hero of Mexican history who delivered a speech called \"The Cry of Dolores\" calling for the end of Spanish Colonial rule. The park also features the Mexico Liberty Bell, a gift from the Mexican government in 1966 and a replica of the bell rung in the town of Dolores to rally freedom fighters at the dawn of the Mexican war for independence. \nClimb to the upper southwestern corner for superb views of downtown, framed by palm trees. Flat patches further down are generally reserved for soccer games, cultural festivals, candlelight vigils and ultimate Frisbee. Fair warning: secondhand highs copped near the refurbished bathroom may have you chasing the helados (ice-cream) cart, which are nearly as plentiful as the Mission District's dispensaries. Grab a beer at Woods Cervecería at the northwest corner of the park or a bite at the Dolores Park Cafe at the northeast corner before you settle in to enjoy enjoy the people watching.\nDolores Park lies between Dolores Street, Church Street, and 18th &amp; 20th Streets. It's officially open from 6AM to 10PM, and can be accessed via public transit using the 14, 33, and 49 busses, the BL, GN, RD, and YL BART routes, and the J streetcar.  \n"

Still, it's become so much a part of San Francisco's fabric and the popular imagination that it's easy to forget what an uphill battle it was to even break ground on the bridge.\nThe decades long battle for the construction of the Golden Gate Bridge included nay-saying over logistical challenges presented by the depth of the bay, the hard winds that come in off the Pacific, and even protected sites like Fort Point. The project also had such fierce opponents as the Southern Pacific Railroad Company's ferry subsidiaries, the United States Navy, and even teamsters advocating for local labor, all who had a vested interest in prevent a bridge from ever crossing the San Francisco Bay.\n\n  \nThe Golden Gate Bridge's art deco design wasn't originally intended to be red – initially, this hue was just the primer coat on the steel ©RICOWde/Getty Images\n\nGolden Gate Bridge design\nDespite plenty of opposition, construction commenced early in 1933 and four years later the Golden Gate Bridge took its place amongst the foremost architectural wonders of the world. Still, San Franciscans have passionate perspectives on every subject, especially their signature landmark – though everyone agrees that it's a good thing that the Navy didn't get its way over the bridge's design.\nNaval officials preferred a hulking concrete span, painted with caution-yellow stripes, over the soaring art-deco design of architects Gertrude and Irving Murrow and engineer Joseph B Strauss, which, luckily, won the day. The iconic International Orange hue, however, is a concession to the military's concerns over visibility – it's the same color used in the aerospace industry, shared by NASA's flight suits and a few other major structures including the 25 de Abril Bridge in Lisbon and Tokyo Tower in Japan. \n\n  \nGolden Gate Bridge at sunset as viewed from Fort Point. The arch in the foreground was designed to preserve this historic site. ©Andrey Popov/Getty Images\n\nWhere to see the Golden Gate Bridge\nAs far as best views go, cinema buffs believe Hitchcock had it right: seen from below at Fort Point, the 1937 bridge induces a thrilling case of Vertigo. Fog aficionados prefer the north-end lookout at Marin’s Vista Point, to watch gusts billow through bridge cables like dry ice at a Kiss concert. Other popular places for bridge photographers include Baker Beach, Crissy Field, and Lands End.\nYou may notice while crossing or simply admiring the span from a nearby vantage point that the Golden Gate Bridge now \"sings\"  – noises that result from very recent retrofits designed to help the bridge withstand intense winds off the ocean. Locals have been less than thrilled about the humming, which has been compared to everything from sound effects common to director David Lynch's eerie ouvre to \"a giant wheezing kazoo.\"\n\n  \nOver 110,000 people drive over the Golden Gate Bridge each day ©Oomka/Shutterstock\n\nTo see both sides of the Golden Gate debate, hike or bike the 1.7-mile span. Muni bus 28 runs to the parking lot, and pedestrians and cyclists can cross the bridge on protected sidewalks. For drivers, bridge tolls are billed electronically to your vehicle's license plate. Tolls are collected only when you are driving southbound into San Francisco. Toll fees are $7.70 for those with a FasTrak account, $8.40 for one time payments by license plate, or $8.70 for a toll invoice.\nBike, bus, boat and foot tours are available through various companies if you want to learn more about the bridge's history up close. Another popular option that kids love are San Francisco Fire Engine Tours in an open-air Big Red Shiny Mack Fire Engine, which not only crosses the Golden Gate Bridge, but also visits other popular sites like Fisherman's Wharf. \n \n\n"

The current temple at 125 Waverly Place opened after the original was destroyed in the great quake.&nbsp;It's so important to San Francisco's Chinese community that Waverly Place is sometimes referred to as&nbsp;天后庙街;&nbsp;天后廟街, or Tin How Temple Street.&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n"

Yank open wooden drawers organized according to pirate logic: a drawer marked 'illumination' holds candles; 'thump' is full of mallets. But leave the stinky tub o' lard well enough alone, or you might get mopped – a pirate hazing ritual that involves a trap door, a mop and the element of surprise.\nBefore you leave, step behind the velvet curtain into the Fish Theater, where a blue-eyed and smirking (yes, smirking) puffer fish is immersed in Method acting. The ichthyoid antics may not be quite up to Sean Penn standards, but, as the sign says, 'Please don't judge the fish.' He's doing his best, and will even read your fortune.\nThe Pirate Supply Store is open weekends from 11AM to 6PM. Take the 33 bus to the 18th and Valencia stop, or the&nbsp;14, 14R, or 49 bus lines to the stop at the corner of Mission and 20th. Either approach puts you within a couple blocks of the Pirate Supply Store, which is conveniently located right by The Mission Playground.\nMore family fun from 826\nFor further literary shenanigans, visit King Carl's Emporium at 826's nautically themed satellite center in the&nbsp;Tenderloin&nbsp;(180 Golden Gate).&nbsp;Check the 826&nbsp;calendar for evening writing workshops, ranging from perfume-inspired fiction to neighborhood oral-history projects.\nThere's even more whimsical fun from Dave Eggers' teams&nbsp;in other cities, too,&nbsp;with the same great mission to get kids excited about reading, writing, dreaming, and learning. Los Angeles' Time Travel Mart&nbsp;in Echo Park, the Mid-Continent Oceanographic Institute in Minneapolis, Chicago's&nbsp;Wicker Park Secret Agent Supply Co.,&nbsp;the&nbsp;Detroit Robot Factory&nbsp;in Michigan, Massachusetts'&nbsp;Greater Boston Bigfoot Research Institute, the&nbsp;Brooklyn Superhero Supply Co.&nbsp;in New York City, Washington DC's&nbsp;Tivoli’s Astounding Magic Supply Company, and the&nbsp;The New Orleans Haunting Supply Co. in Louisiana&nbsp;– all are similarly fun storefronts that support the cause and fire up the imaginations of kids of all ages.\n"

Some speculate their arrival may have had something to do with the Loma Prieta earthquake that October, but it's more likely that the sea lions simply caught on to the charms of Fisherman's Wharf along with all the other tourists.\nHow to see sea lions at Fisherman's Wharf\nThese giant mammals ‘haul out’ onto the docks between January and July, and whenever else they feel like sunbathing. Night and day they canoodle, belch, scratch and gleefully shove one another off the docks. Naturally these unkempt squatters have become San Francisco’s favorite mascots, and since California law requires boats to make way for marine mammals, yacht owners have to relinquish valuable slips to accommodate as many as 1000 sea lions.\n\n  \nTourists and sea lions at Pier 39 ©Michael Urmann/Shutterstock\n\nThe city is even celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of the sea lions' arrival with a new public art project featuring 30 sea lion sculptures hand-painted by Bay Area artists. Keep your eyes peeled as you roam the streets of San Francisco for these colorful tributes – they each come with a QR code you can scan to read the artist's statement and learn more about some aspect of sea lion life, San Francisco, or Bay Area flora and fauna.\nNot only have the sea lions been honored with public art, Mayor London Breed declared January 16 as the city's official Sea Lion Day – so bark and clap your fins if you love these goofy interlopers. \nFor more information about San Francisco's sea lions, head upstairs from Pier 35 to the Sea Lion Center, where you can ask questions and check out the sea lion exhibits, including the full-sized skeleton of an adult male.\n"

        "detail_description": "The Legion of Honor, or more formally known as the “California Palace of the Legion of Honor”, is a part of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. It is home to a vast collection of works and artifacts that span 4000 years of art history, all set out in a beautiful building that overlooks the Golden Gate Bridge.\nThe Legion of Honor has welcomed visitors hailing from near and far for almost a century – it first opened in 1924, built to commemorate Californian soldiers who died in World War I. It was a gift of Alma de Bretteville Spreckels, wife of the sugar industry tycoon and thoroughbred racehorse owner and breeder, Adolph B. Spreckels.\n\n  \nVisitors admire the art on show at the Legion of Honor © Anthony Pidgeon / Lonely Planet\n\nWhat to see \nFrom the outside, this majestic work of architecture is a beautiful example of neoclassical design. Sheltered by the towering Monterey Pines of Lincoln Park, the site offers dramatic views of the Pacific Ocean and the Golden Gate Bridge (perfect for photo ops!). \nInside, the Legion holds a vast collection of paintings (particularly works by European artists), photographs and sculptures that runs from ancient times to modern day.The Hall of Antiquities displays ancient works from Egypt, the Near East, Greece, and Rome, including sculptures, figurines, vessels, jewelry, and carved reliefs.\nBe sure to check out The Spreckels Organ, a magnificent pipe organ built in 1924 by the Ernest M. Skinner Organ Company, of Boston, and presented to the Legion as a gift for its opening. The instrument is considered to be one of the finest organs in the world, with pipes ranging in size from half an inch to 32 feet. To hear the instrument in action, check the schedule for weekly performances.\nThere are also numerous works on display by master French sculptor Rodin, including a cast of what is arguably his most famous work, “The Thinker,” which dates back to 1880, and is a depiction an artist deep in thought (possibly the poet Dante, possibly Michelangelo). Today the sculpture has become a symbol for all poets and philosophers, pondering life’s big questions.\nIf you visit the gallery during November, be sure to see the Book of Gold. It is usually in the Fine Arts Museums’ archives for safekeeping but is shown annually at the Legion during the month of November to honor California veterans. Spreckels had military records scoured for the names and hometowns of those Californian military members who served and died in WWI. A calligrapher then inscribed the roughly 3600 names into this Book of Gold, which took a total of eight years to complete.\n\n  \nThe Palace of Legion contains sculptures, paintings and photographs from throughout history © Anthony Pidgeon / Lonely Planet\n\nTours, admission prices and guides\nThe museum itself is open Tuesday to Sunday and is closed most Mondays and holidays. General admission tickets start at $15 for adults and discounts are available for seniors and students. People aged 17 and under can enter for free.\nGeneral admission to the museum is free on the first Tuesday of every month – but note that this offer applies only to the permanent collection galleries. Visitors must still pay full-price for admission to the special exhibition. Visitors can check this calendar to see specific special hours and holidays. Those who want to delve deeper into the art on display can take a guided tour, offered in a range of languages.\nYou can take pictures within the museum, provided it’s with a handheld camera (no additional equipment allowed) and doesn’t disturb other visitors.\nVisitors can also save money with the San Francisco CityPASS which includes admission to the Legion of Honor and offers 49% or more off unlimited cable car rides.\nHotels nearby\nSpend the night at the Omni San Francisco Hotel, which is located in the heart of downtown San Francisco, right on the cable car line and just a short walk to Union Square. Tickets to the de Young and Legion of Honor are available for purchase at the concierge desk, and it’s an ideal location for visitors to indulge in some retail splurges after a day of educational art history, with Union Square known for its high-end shopping outlets, as well as its impressive art galleries.\n"
