Pedal boats can also be hired.\nNaina Devi Temple is on the precise spot where the eye is believed to have fallen. Nearby is the Jama Masjid mosque and a gurdwara. You can walk around the lake in about an hour – the southern side is more peaceful and has good views of the town."

Officials in blue uniforms collect donations and, as the sun sets, bells ring out a rhythm, torches are lit, and leaf baskets with flower petals inside and a candle on top (₹10) are lit and placed on the river to drift away downstream.\nTourists can mingle with the crowd to experience the rituals of an ancient religion that still retains its power in the modern age. Someone may claim to be a priest and help you with your puja before asking for ₹200 or more. If you want to make a donation, it's best to give to a uniformed collector.The best time to visit the ghats are just before dusk for ganga aarti; aim to get here an hour before sunset to ensure a good seat to watch the ceremony. To get here walk the length of the ghats starting from one of the bridges close to the train station which will allow you to observe the spiritual fervour of pilgrims who've come far and wide to bathe in the Ganges."

Don't miss the meditation hall, with bizarre warrens of rock-lined hallways and striking street-art pieces.\nThere are numerous abandoned buildings to explore, some downright creepy, including the derelict lodging where the Beatles resided (along with the likes of Mike Love from the Beach Boys, Mia Farrow and her sister Prudence – whom the Beatles song was written after). Also here is the crumbling mansion where Maharishi Mahesh stayed. The meditation domes lost to the jungle also make for a surreal sight. Given the entire site is surrounded by jungle, an electric fence has recently been installed in an attempt to keep out leopard and elephant that are visitors.To commemorate the 50-year anniversary of the Beatles visit, a permanent photograph exhibition was unveiled in 2018 of the snaps taken by Paul Saltzman (www.thebeatlesinindia.com), one of the only photographers permitted inside the ashram, who documented their stay. There's also a room dedicated to Transcendental Meditation, which was established here by Maharishi Mahesh."

Over 300 species of flowers are found here.\nUnfortunately, most flowers bloom during the monsoon season in July and August, when access becomes difficult and hazardous. Some believe that the valley isn’t worth visiting outside peak flower season, but even without its technicolour carpet it’s still ridiculously beautiful. And it's more likely to be sunny.

The puja offered inside, especially around the stone 'hump', is fervent and can be quite intense. The site is so auspicious that pilgrims used to throw themselves from one of the cliffs behind the temple in the hope of instantly attaining moksha (liberation from samsara).\nMuch of the village around the temple was destroyed by the raging waters and huge rocks that washed down from the surrounding slopes. Today, nearly as much reverence is paid to a massive boulder that sits behind the temple – which, incredibly, shielded it from the worst of the onslaught and saved it from collapse – as to the temple itself.In the epic Mahabharata, after the Pandavas defeated the Dhartarashtras, they sought forgiveness for killing their own family members, as their enemies also happened to be their cousins. Shiva refused them, but the Pandavas were so relentless in their quest for absolution that Shiva, in the form of a bull, dove into the ground to elude them. He left his hump behind at Kedarnath, below the source of the sacred Mandakini River, where a magnificent stone temple – built in the 8th century by Guru Shankara – marks the spot. (Other portions of Shiva’s bull-form body are worshipped at the other four Panch Kedar shrines, which take some effort to reach: the arms at Tungnath, the face at Rudranath, the navel at Madmaheshwar and the hair at Kalpeshwar.)"

A short walk from one another are two scenic Hindu temples: Mostamanu is a sprawling site dedicated to Manu; and the more serene Pashupatinath is set among forest and a grassy clearing and features sublime views over the valley. A return taxi will cost ₹400 or so.\n"
