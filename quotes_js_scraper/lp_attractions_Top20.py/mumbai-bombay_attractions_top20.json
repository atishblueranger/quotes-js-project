Its vast collection includes impressive Hindu and Buddhist sculpture, terracotta figurines from the Indus Valley, Indian miniature paintings and some particularly vicious-looking weaponry.\nGood information is provided in English, and audioguides (free for foreigners) are available in seven languages. Six of the galleries are air-conditioned, offering a welcome relief from the summer heat. For a quick historical overview of Mumbai, the new 20-minute Mumbai Experience (₹50) is shown in English five times per day."

It was built in 1903 by the Parsi industrialist JN Tata, supposedly after he was refused entry to nearby European hotels on account of being ‘a native’. Dozens were killed inside the hotel when it was targeted during the 2008 terrorist attacks, and images of its burning facade were beamed worldwide. The fully restored hotel reopened on Independence Day 2010.\nMuch more than an iconic building, the Taj’s history is intrinsically linked with the nation: it was the first hotel in India to employ women, the first to have electricity (and fans), and it also housed freedom fighters (for no charge) during the struggle for independence.Today the Taj fronts the harbour and Gateway of India, but it was originally designed to face the city (the entrance has been changed)."

Created between AD 450 and 750, the labyrinth of cave temples represent some of India’s most impressive temple carving.\nThe main Shiva-dedicated temple is an intriguing latticework of courtyards, halls, pillars and shrines; its magnum opus is a 6m-tall statue of Sadhashiva, depicting a three-faced Shiva as the destroyer, creator and preserver of the universe, his eyes closed in eternal contemplation.It was the Portuguese who dubbed the island Elephanta because of a large stone elephant near the shore (this collapsed in 1814 and was moved by the British to Mumbai’s Jijamata Udyan). There’s a small museum on-site, with informative pictorial panels on the origin of the caves.Pushy, expensive guides are available – but you don’t really need one as Pramod Chandra’s A Guide to the Elephanta Caves, widely for sale, is more than sufficient.Launches head to Gharapuri from the Gateway of India every half hour from 9am to 3.30pm. Buy tickets from the MTDC booth at Apollo Bunder. The voyage takes about an hour.The ferries dock at the end of a concrete pier, from where you can walk or take the miniature train (₹10) to the stairway leading up to the caves (it’s lined with souvenir stalls and patrolled by pesky monkeys). A passenger tax (₹5) is also charged. Wear good shoes (those opting to walk are looking at 1.2km). Doli-carriers charge ₹1200 to carry up the aged or disabled."

It's also known as CSMT.\nSome of the architectural detail is incredible, with dog-faced gargoyles adorning the magnificent central tower and peacock-filled windows above the central courtyard. Designed by Frederick Stevens, it was completed in 1887, 34 years after the first train in India left this site.Despite being renamed again in 2017, after being changed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) in 1998, it’s still better known locally as VT."

Ironically, the British builders of the gateway used it just 24 years later to parade the last British regiment as India marched towards independence.\nThese days, the gateway is a favourite gathering spot for locals and a top place for people watching. Giant-balloon sellers, photographers, vendors making bhelpuri, locals begging for selfies with foreigners and touts all rub shoulders, creating all the hubbub of a bazaar. In February/March they are joined by classical dancers and musicians who perform during the Elephanta Festival. Boats depart from the gateway’s wharves for Elephanta Island.The Gateway is reached via a heavy security checkpoint at the southeastern end of Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Marg."

Urban development has muscled in on the fringes of the park, but its heart is very peaceful.\nThere is no trekking ban per se but accessing areas within the core protected area requires prior permission, so the easiest way to take a walk in the woods is by going with Bombay Natural History Society.

The park's most intriguing option, the Kanheri Caves, is a set of 109 dwellings and monastic structures for Buddhist monks 6km inside the park. The caves, not all of which are accessible, were developed over 1000 years, beginning in the 1st century BC, as part of a sprawling monastic university complex. Avoid the zoo-like lion and tiger ‘safari’ as the animals are in cages and enclosures.Inside the park’s main northern entrance is an information centre with a small exhibition on the park’s wildlife. The best time to see birds is October to April and butterflies from August to November. Activities can now also be booked online.An information centre with a small exhibition on the park’s wildlife is inside the park’s main northern entrance.

Piles of pomfret, blue crabs, rawas (white salmon), tambusa (Indian red snapper), tuna, cuttlefish and sting rays are hawked – 20 tonnes per day – often in heated exchanges of commerce and camaraderie.

        "detail_description": "Nestled in the arty district of Kala Ghoda, the Horniman Circle Garden is the city’s favourite green oasis. Built in 1833, the garden is spread over 2½ acres (one hectare) and comes into its own during the Kala Ghoda Arts Festival in February and Ruhaniyat, a programme of Sufi musical events held between November and March. At other times, families, young couples and old-timers can be found seeking solace on the garden's peaceful pathways, particularly on balmy summer evenings.\nThe park has a popular play area for kids, and plenty of park benches and lawns where people like to doze. If sleep is not what you seek, grab a takeaway chai and sit on the fountain parapet for a spot of people watching. While you are here, it's worth ducking into the column-fronted Asiatic Society Library, in Mumbai's colonial era Town Hall, which contains thousands of vintage tomes, including one of the only two original copies of Dante’s Divine Comedy."

A Christian enclave of elegant two-storey Portuguese-style wooden mansions (of which only 23 out of 65 have survived), it’s 500m northeast of Girgaum Chowpatty, lying amid Mumbai’s predominantly Hindu and Muslim neighbourhoods. The winding lanes allow a wonderful glimpse into a quiet(ish) life away from noisier Mumbai.\nIt’s not large, but you can spend a while wandering the alleyways and admiring the old homes and, around Christmas, their decorations. You can also plan an East Indian feast in advance or sleep at the home of celebrated fashion designer, Khotachiwadi activist and amateur chef James Ferreira (www.jamesferreira.co.in – find his rooms on Airbnb).To find Khotachiwadi, head for St Teresa’s Church, on the corner of Jagannath Shankarsheth Marg (JSS Marg) and Rajarammohan Roy Marg (RR Rd/Charni Rd), then head directly opposite the church on JSS Marg and duck down the third lane on your left (look for the faded Khotachiwadi wall stencil map that says 'Khotachiwadi Imaginaries')."

        "detail_description": "The Wall Project started as an initiative by artists to add colour to a suburban street in Bandra, and has introduced vibrant public art, murals and graffiti across the city. There’s no official membership, and the art has been created by both amateurs and professionals.\nNo advertising, political statements, religious content or obscene messaging are used, according to the project's guidelines. Social messaging that’s too preachy is not encouraged either. Most murals deal with personal stories: people's dreams, desire for change, criticisms and frustrations.The most spectacular stretch is perhaps the 2km canvas along Senapati Bapat Marg (Tulsi Pipe Rd), between the train stations of Mahim and Dadar on the Western Line, where the art parallels the tracks. It’s a very thought-provoking and enriching experience to take in; allow 1½ hours for exploring. If you peep into the railway stations on that stretch of road you'll see the paintings have also encroached onto the ticket counters and staircases. This section of wall had long been coveted by the project founders, who expected opposition from authorities. Instead they were actually invited to create something by the city’s municipal commissioner.Bandra is another area rich in street art, where many walls and bridges have been customised: Waroda Road is a good place to start investigating."

While the inner sanctum houses a brilliant white marble statue of the Buddha, the main prayer hall offers a rainbow-coloured tour of the Buddha's life, painted with natural vegetable dye, with Japanese inscriptions written high on the walls of the shrine.\nTwice a day, believers gather around a huge Japanese drum, to chant the temple’s mantra – Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō ('devotion to the law of the Lotus Sutra'), an expression of determination to embrace the principles of Nichiren Buddhism. Today, the temple is managed and maintained by some of the city’s leading philanthropists, the Birla Family."

The near-century old, two-storey temple – the last of its kind in Mumbai – is adorned with murals of Chinese gods, prayer flags, light lamps and crimson paraphernalia. To reach the temple, take the Harbour line to Dockyard Road Station.\nEvery year, the city's remaining Chinese population, now less than 1000 people, gather to seek the blessings of Kwan Kuang, the Warrior God. Come and meditate on the wooden floor or listen to the stories of an era gone by from the temple’s caretaker – Albert – whose forefathers built the temple."
