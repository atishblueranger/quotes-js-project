        "detail_description": "One of Dubai’s most attractive developments, Madinat Jumeirah is a contemporary interpretation of a traditional Arab village, complete with a souq (market), palm-fringed waterways and desert-colored hotels and villas festooned with wind towers. It’s especially enchanting at night, when the gardens are romantically lit and the Burj Al Arab gleams in the background. There are exquisite details throughout, so if you see some stairs, take them – they might lead you to a hidden terrace with a mesmerising vista of the sprawling complex.\nArchitecture of Madinat Jumeirah\nThe architects of this luxurious resort village at the foot of the Burj Al Arab looked to Dubai's original creekside settlement in Bur Dubai for inspiration. Wind towers, traditional wooden boats used as water taxis, waterways and even a market create modern Arabian flair in this complex that comprises three palatial hotels and dozens of private villas set in a richly landscaped garden.\n\n  \nSouk Madinat Jumeirah is constructed to look like a traditional Arab market © Tupungato / Shutterstock\n\nShopping at Souk Madinat Jumeirah\nAt the heart of the complex lies Souk Madinat Jumeirah, a maze-like bazaar with around 75 shops lining wood-framed walkways. Although the ambience is too contrived to feel like an authentic Arab market, the quality of some of the crafts, art and souvenirs is actually quite high. For a bit of Western culture, see what’s playing at the Madinat Theatre. There are numerous cafes, bars and restaurants, the nicest of which overlook the waterways and the Burj Al Arab.\n\n  \nVisitors can ride traditional-style boats through the waterways of Madinat Jumeirah © Seqoya / Shutterstock\n\nRiding an abra at Madinat Jumeirah\nExplore Madinat Jumeirah's 2.5-mile-long network of winding waterways on a leisurely 20-minute cruise aboard a traditional-style abra (a motorized wooden boat) with cushioned benches. The desert seems far away as you glide past enchanting gardens of billowing bougainvillea, bushy banana trees and soaring palms, all set against the dramatic Burj Al Arab backdrop. Tours leave from the Souk Madinat waterfront (near Trader Vic's). No reservations are necessary. If you are staying at a Madinat hotel or eating at one of the restaurants, your abra shuttle is free.\n\n  \nMadinat Jumeirah has plenty of bars and restaurants with great views of the Burj Al Arab © Gimas / Shutterstock\n\nWhere to get Friday brunch at Madinat Jumeirah\nAt the start of the weekend in the United Arab Emirates, Friday brunch in Dubai is a time-honored tradition, especially among Western expats. The Madinat hotels Al Qasr and Mina A'Salam are famous for putting on some of the most most opulent spreads in town. Both dish up an unbelievable cornucopia of delectables – roast lamb, sushi, cooked-to-order seafood, beautiful salads, mezze and all sorts of hot dishes, plus there are cheese and dessert rooms. Make dinner or brunch reservations at least one week ahead for most of the restaurants.\nTurtle watching\nThe Jumeirah Al Naseem resort is the latest addition to Madinat Jumeirah and the home of the nonprofit Dubai Turtle Rehabilitation Project. It has nursed more than 560 injured or sick sea turtles back to health and released them into the Gulf. The turtles spend the last weeks before their release in the hotel's sea-fed lagoon. The enclosure is open to the public daily for free, and feedings take place at 11am on Wednesdays. Access is via the hotel. Keep an eye out for specimens of the endemic hawksbill turtle that limped onto the list of critically endangered species, with only 8000 nesting females known to exist worldwide.\nYoga on the beach\nDownward dog and sun salutation with a view of the Burj Al Arab? Just sign up for the daily sunset yoga sessions  for Dhs90 ($24.50) organized by the on-site Talise Spa and on Madinat Jumeirah's private beach. An even more spiritual journey awaits during Full Moon Yoga – if you can get the timing right.\n\n  \nMadinat Jumeirah has a handful of five-star accommodations © Peter Pesta Photography / Getty Images\n\nWhere to stay near Madinat Jumeirah\nMadinat Jumeirah is located in the Jumeirah neighborhood of Dubai. Luxury lovers should steer towards the Burj Al Arab or the hotels at Madinat Jumeirah. The cluster of midrange hotels and hotel-apartments next to the Mall of Emirates offer great value for money.\nWhere to eat near Madinat Jumeirah\nTake advantage of happy-hour deals offered at many Madinat bars. For sunset drinks with a view of the Burj Al Arab, the rug-lined terrace of the Bahri Bar is a perfect vantage point. Book early for delicious seafood with Madinat and Burj Al Arab views at chic and sophisticated Pierchic.\nHow to get to Madinat Jumeirah\nThe nearest Dubai Metro station is Mall of the Emirates, but you'll need to take a taxi or bus from there. Buses 8, 81 and 88 pass by Madinat Jumeirah.\n"

        "detail_description": "The Burj Khalifa is a stunning feat of architecture and engineering, with two observation decks on the 124th and 148th floors and a restaurant-bar on the 122nd. The world’s tallest building pierces the sky at 2715ft (828m) and opened in January 2010, six years after excavations began. Up to 13,000 workers toiled day and night, putting up a new floor in as little as three days.\n\n  \nThe Burj Khalifa is the tallest building in the world at 2715 feet © Umar Shariff / Shutterstock\n\nHow to get tickets to visit the Burj Khalifa\nTo avoid wait times or expensive fast-track admission, book tickets online as far as 30 days in advance. Timed tickets are available at the ticket counter and often sell out quickly. Book especially early if you want to go up at sunset. Prices go up during prime hours (around sunset), and closing times may vary depending on demand and the season. Budget at least two hours for your visit. For a more in-depth experience, you can rent audio guides for Dhs25 ($6.80).\nHigh humidity often cloaks Dubai in a dense haze, making views less than breathtaking. On hazy days, it’s better to visit at night. No refunds or rain checks are given if the outdoor viewing terrace is closed for bad weather.\n\n  \nThe Burj Khalifa has two observation decks, on the 124th floor and the 148th floor © ardiwebs / Shutterstock\n\nAt the Top Observation Deck\nTaking in the views from the world's tallest building is a deservedly crave-worthy experience and a trip to the \"At the Top\" observation deck on the 124th floor (1483ft) is the most popular way to do it. Once you get to the platform, you can seek out high-powered \"viewfinders\" that help bring even distant developments into focus (at least on clear days) and cleverly simulate the same view at night and in the 1980s. There are also six digital telescopes that use HD cameras with a high zoom to zero in on places outside the cityscape. Getting to the deck means passing various multimedia exhibits until a double-decker elevator zips you up at 32ft per second.\nAt the Top Sky\nTo truly be on the world's highest observation platform, you need to buy tickets to \"At the Top Sky\" on the 148th floor (1820ft). A visit here is set up like a hosted VIP experience with refreshments, a guided tour and an interactive screen where you \"fly\" to different city landmarks by hovering your hands over high-tech sensors. Afterwards, you're escorted to the 125th floor to be showered with Burj trivia and to take in another attraction called \"A Falcon's Eye View\" that lets you take a virtual flight over the emirate by soaring over key attractions like a bird.\nRestaurants and bars at the Burj Khalifa\nThe food may not be out of this world, but the views are certainly stellar from At.mosphere, the world's highest restaurant, on the 122nd floor (1450ft). Richly decorated in warm mahogany, limestone and thick carpets, the dining room oozes a sophisticated ambience while the compact menu lets quality meats and seafood shine. There's also a lounge one floor up if you just want a drink. Reservations are essential, minimum spends apply, a dress code is in effect and no children under 10 are allowed. To get there, you need to take the elevator from the foyer of the Armani Hotel.\n\n  \nThe Burj Khalifa opened six years after construction started © shutterlk / Shutterstock\n\nBurj Khalifa construction and architecture\nEngineers and the Chicago-based architecture firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill (SOM) had to pull out all the stops in the construction of the Burj Khalifa. Pouring the 11.5ft-thick foundation alone required 16,350 cubic yards (12,500 cubic meters) of reinforced concrete. The design was inspired by the Hymenocallis desert lily.\nBurj Khalifa's superlative statistics\nThe Burj Khalifa is not only the world's tallest building (for now) but also flaunts other records and impressive figures, including the following:\n\ntallest free-standing structure\nhighest outdoor observation deck (1820ft)\nhighest occupied floor (160th floor, at 1920ft)\nlongest elevator (1653ft)\nhighest number of floors (211)\nhighest restaurant (122nd floor, at 1483ft)\nweight of concrete used is equivalent to 100,000 elephants\nthe service elevator has a carrying capacity of 6 tons\nthe facade is made of 28,261 glass panels\nit takes three to four months to clean the facade\nin 2011 French climber Alain Robert scaled the Burj in just over six hours\nin April 2014 two other Frenchmen (Vincent Reffet and Frédéric Fugen) set the world record base jump from the Burj\nthe largest light-and-sound show on a single building on New Year's Eve 2017\n\n\n  \nDowntown Dubai's skyline rises out of early morning fog © Naufal MQ / Getty Images\n\nWhere to stay near the Burj Khalifa\nThe Burj Khalifa is located in Downtown Dubai, and the Armani Hotel occupies 15 of the lower floors of the Burj Khalifa. Staying in Downtown Dubai puts you smack dab in the city's vortex of vibrancy. Aside from the big international chains, you'll also find a few home-grown players imbued with a local sense of place. With few exceptions, you'll need to shell out top dirham.\nWhere to eat near the Burj Khalifa\nIf you don't want to shell out for a meal in the world's highest restaurant, there are plenty of other options nearby. For fresh organic salads and mains with a view of the Burj and the lake, head to Baker &amp; Spice. Majlis in the Dubai Mall's Souk section serves refreshments made with camel milk, including a creamy camelccino (cappuccino with camel milk).\nHow to get to the Burj Khalifa\nTake the Dubai Metro to Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall.\n"

        "detail_description": "The Burj Al Arab's graceful silhouette – meant to evoke the sail of a dhow (a traditional wooden cargo vessel) – is to Dubai what the Eiffel Tower is to Paris. Completed in 1999, this iconic landmark hotel sits on an artificial island and comes with its own helipad and a fleet of chauffeur-driven Rolls Royce limousines. Beyond the striking lobby, with its gold-leaf opulence and attention-grabbing fountain, lie 202 suites with more trimmings than a Christmas turkey.\nThe Burj Al Arab is worth visiting if only to gawk at an interior that’s every bit as garish as the exterior is gorgeous. The mood is set in the 590ft-high lobby, which is decorated in a red, blue and green color scheme and accented with pillars draped in gold leaf. The lobby atrium is tall enough to fit the Statue of Liberty within it.\nIf you’re not checking into the Burj Al Arab, you need to make a reservation for cocktails, afternoon tea or a meal to get past lobby security. A minimum spend applies; check the Burj's website for details.\n\n  \nWhen it opened in 1999, the Burj Al Arab was the tallest hotel in the world at 1053ft © Romrodphoto /Shutterstock\n\nArchitecture of the Burj Al Arab\nThe Burj Al Arab has 60 floors spread over 1053ft (321m) and was the world's tallest hotel at the time of its opening. British architect Tom Wright came up with the iconic design and signature translucent fiberglass facade that serves as a shield from the desert sun during the day and as a screen for the impressive illumination at night.\nThe Burj Al Arab's interior by British-Chinese designer Khuan Chew is every bit as over-the-top as the exterior is simple and elegant. The moment you step into the lofty lobby, a crescendo of gold-leaf, crystal chandeliers, hand-knotted carpets, water elements, pillars and other design elements put you into sensory overload. Some of the 258,333 sq feet (24,000 sq meters) of marble hail from the same quarry where Michelangelo got his material.\nThe white metal crosspieces at the top of the Burj Al Arab form what is said to be the largest cross in the Middle East – but it’s only visible from the sea. By the time this unexpected feature was discovered, it was too late to redesign the tower – the hotel had already put Dubai on the map and become the icon for the city. See the cross on a boat charter and decide for yourself. The scale is amazing.\n\n  \nDubai-inspired cocktails are served in the Burj Al Arab's Gold on 27 bar © Lara Brunt / Lonely Planet\n\nBars and restaurants in Burj Al Arab\nThe cobalt-blue and emerald-green color scheme may not exactly project class and exclusivity, but all is forgotten when enjoying the dreamy views of the Gulf and Dubai skyline from the Skyview Bar. A cocktail or afternoon tea in this capsule-shaped lounge sticking out from the main building on the 27th floor is high on the to-do list of many Dubai visitors despite the steep minimum spends. Reservations are essential.\nIf you've got a hankering for unusual cocktails, book a perch in gold-leaf-drenched Gold on 27, on the same floor as Skyview. Drinks are inspired by Dubai's past, present and future and include many nonalcoholic choices. A Ghaf, A Goat and A Camel, for instance, is not the beginning of a joke but a delicious potion blending Cascara milk, bourbon vanilla, white peach nectar and sweet goat-cheese meringue. Book ahead.\n\n  \nThe Burj Al Arab is set on its own island and is surrounded by gorgeous beaches © Vivek_Renukaprasad / Getty Images\n\nBeaches near the Burj Al Arab\nFor the quintessential Instagrammable photo of you and the Burj Al Arab, take a stroll on nearby Jumeirah Public Beach as the sun dips into the Gulf and then upload the picture via one of the Smart Palms that provide free waterfront wi-fi. This wide, clean band of sand is actually an attractive place to spread your towel any time of day. In fact, now there's even a floodlit section for nighttime swimming. When the surf's up, it's fun to watch the boarders, although waves are only small to medium.\nTop 7 beaches in Dubai\n\n  \nThe Burj Al Arab is a self-appointed 7-star hotel that comes with all the trimmings © Dmitry Birin / Shutterstock\n\nWhere to stay near the Burj Al Arab\nThe Burj Al Arab regularly hosts pop stars, royalty, billionaires and the merely moneyed. The lobby with its eye-catching waterfall and opulent decor is the overture to the 202 richly decorated suites. The North Deck adds two huge pools and 400 sunloungers. Suites are bi-level, and even the smallest measure 1829 sq ft (170 sq meters) and come with a personal butler. The decor is lush, with moiré silk walls, mirrored ceilings over the beds, curlicue high-backed velvet chairs and inlaid bathroom tiles displaying scenes of Venice. And all that gold? Yes, it’s the real 24-karat thing.\nFor less luxurious options, the cluster of midrange hotels and hotel-apartments next to the Mall of Emirates offer great value for money.\nWhere to eat near the Burj Al Arab\nFor a surreal dining experience at the Burj Al Arab, book a table at Al Mahara to nosh on fish and seafood while seated before a giant, round aquarium. An elevator posing as a submarine drops you into a gold-leaf-clad tunnel spilling into one of Dubai's most extravagant restaurants. Tables orbit a circular floor-to-ceiling aquarium where clownfish flit and baby sharks dart as their turbot and monkfish cousins are being devoured. Only the finest seafood imported from the UK – and prepared with deft simplicity – makes it onto plates here. A dress code is enforced, and no children under 12 for dinner.\nFor spots with a view of the Burj Al Arab, head to the bars in Madinat Jumeirah, such as Folly by Nick &amp; Scott, for romantic views of the tower. \nHow to get to the Burj Al Arab\nThe nearest Dubai Metro station is Mall of the Emirates, but a taxi or bus ride is required from there. Buses 8, 81 and 88 pass by the Burj Al Arab.\n"

        "detail_description": "Designed by Pritzker Prize–winning architect Jean Nouvel, the highly anticipated Louvre Abu Dhabi finally arrived in late 2017. Through 12 galleries, the world-class collection traces humanity's artistic achievements from the Neolithic up to the present day, all the while breaking all norms of traditional museum curation. Here, artworks are grouped by theme and time-frame rather than country or specific civilisation. The result is a globe-trotting journey through human heritage that highlights the universal threads of all cultures.\nFrom the First Villages (gallery 1) through Civilisations and Empires (gallery 3) and The Magnificence of the Court (gallery 8) all the way up to A Global Stage (gallery 12), where Ai Weiwei's 2016 'Fountain of Light' takes centre stage, the exhibits transcend geography and nationality. This means you encounter unexpectedly beautiful juxtapositions such as a bronze winged dragon from northern China sitting in front of a glazed-brick Persian archer from the Achaemenid Empire, and the bronze head of an Edo Culture king from Nigeria displayed amid a room lined with French and Italian 17th-century oil paintings of royalty.Highlights include an eerily beautiful 7th-millennium-BC Ain Ghazal statue from Jordan; a 3rd-millennium-BC standing Bactrian princess; a black stone statue of Gudea, prince of Lagash from Iraq's neo-Summerian era; a c 2nd-century Buddhist stupa plaque from India; a 2nd-century bronze lion from Spain; a 15th-century ceramic bust of St Peter of Verona; and paintings by Picasso, Rothko and Miró.As well as the permanent collection, separate buildings house temporary exhibitions (four held annually), a children's museum and the excellent museum cafe. These buildings are all grouped around a central plaza which juts straight out into the sea and is shaded by the museum's elaborate 7500-ton filigree dome, which seems to hover mid-air above. The dome pays homage to date-palm-leaf shading with its geometric star design dappling the plaza floor below in a 'rain of light' effect.You'll need around two hours to explore the museum if you're just browsing, longer if you've got an interest in art or history. For a highlight snapshot of the collection, 90-minute tours (adult/child Dhs50/30) are offered at 11am and 2pm daily in English and at 5pm on Friday in Arabic and French."

        "detail_description": "Opened in 2017, this striking modern museum engagingly chronicles the birth of the UAE in 1971, spurred by the discovery of oil in the 1950s and the withdrawal of the British in 1968. Documentary films, photographs, artefacts, timelines and interactive displays zero in on historic milestones in the years leading up to and immediately following this momentous occasion and pay homage to the country's seven founding fathers. Free tours of the adjacent circular Union House, where the agreement was signed, are available.\nThe museum building is an elegant design by the Canadian architecture firm Moriyama &amp; Teshima. Its parabolic roof represents the sheet of paper upon which the declaration was written, while the seven golden columns in the entrance hall symbolise the pens with which it was signed. An expansive white travertine plaza links the building with the historic round Union House and the re-created guesthouse where the founding fathers stayed while the negotiations were underway. The original flagpole where the rulers gathered after the deal was done looms above a reflecting pool.The generously proportioned below-ground galleries are accessed from the monumental entrance hall via a sweeping white marble staircase. On your right hangs a giant painting by Emirati artist Abdul Qader Al Rais that depicts the geography of the UAE. Just beyond are giant, eye-catching photographs of the rulers of the seven emirates that founded the nation, along with their family tree and personal effects such as Sheikh Zayed's cane and sunglasses and Sheikh Rashid's passport. Further on, you can catch 3D documentaries on the founding years, the original first page of the Constitution and a 'road to unification' digital timeline.The name, by the way, has nothing to do with the airline: Etihad is simply the Arabic word for 'union'."

        "detail_description": "The city's main historical museum charts Dubai's turbo-evolution from fishing and pearling village to global centre of commerce, finance and tourism. It has an atmospheric setting in the compact Al Fahidi Fort, built around 1800 and considered Dubai's oldest remaining structure. A walk-through mock souq, exhibits on Bedouin life in the desert and a room highlighting the importance of the sea illustrate the days before the discovery of oil. The last room showcases archaeological findings from nearby excavation sites.\nFortified by three towers, Al Fahidi Fort served as the residence of the local rulers until 1896 and went through stints as a prison and a garrison before becoming a museum in 1971. A sturdy teak door festooned with brass spikes gives way to the courtyard dotted with bronze cannons, traditional boats and an areesha (a palm-frond hut that was the kind of summer home most locals lived in until the middle of the 20th century). Flanking the courtyard are rooms with modest displays of instruments and weapons.The main exhibit is underground and reached via a spiralling ramp. A video and a timeline uses historical prints and footage to illustrate just how far Dubai has come since the 1960s. From here, cross the deck of a dhow (traditional cargo boat) to enter a mock souq (market) with life-size dioramas depicting shopkeepers and craftspeople at work, enhanced by light and sound effects and grainy documentary films. Other galleries illustrate life in the desert and at sea. The latter includes a small but fascinating pearl-diving exhibit where you can marvel at the fact that divers wore merely nose clips and leather gloves while descending to extraordinary depths.The final galleries present archaeological finds from ancient settlements and tombs at Jumeirah, Hatta, Al Qusais and other local sites that reveal that the area has been settled for at least 4000 years."

        "detail_description": "Traffic fades to a quiet hum in the labyrinthine lanes of this nicely restored heritage area formerly known as the Bastakiya Quarter. Its narrow walking lanes are flanked by sand-coloured houses topped with wind towers, which provide natural air-conditioning. Today there are about 50 buildings containing museums, craft shops, cultural exhibits, courtyard cafes, art galleries and two boutique hotels.\nThe quarter was built in the early 1900s by merchants from the Persian town of Bastak, who settled in Dubai to take advantage of tax breaks granted by the sheikh. By the 1970s, though, the buildings had fallen into disrepair, and residents began moving on to newer, more comfortable neighbourhoods. Dedicated locals, expats and even the UK's Prince Charles prevented the area's demolition in the 1980s. Hidden within the restored maze, which is easily explored on an aimless wander, is a short section of the old city wall from 1800. For a more in-depth experience, join a guided tour with the Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding.Next to the district is the bustling waterfront tourist development of Al Seef."

        "detail_description": "If you thought the UAE's history only really began when oil was struck, you'd be wrong, and this site is a fascinating introduction to a mind-boggling heritage. Archaeological excavations at Mleiha (pronounced 'maleha') have unearthed evidence that early humans passed through here on their way to Asia during the Palaeolithic era; that a Neolithic community lived here in circa 8000 BC; and that this site was settled consecutively during the Bronze, Iron and pre-Islamic eras. An utterly riveting historic day-out.\nThe flash visitors centre, built around a massive tomb from the Bronze Age Umm An Nar culture, hosts a museum with plenty of multimedia displays and information panels that go a long way to explain Mleiha's historic importance, but as the various archaeological excavations from different eras are scattered across the surrounding desert, booking one of the centre's well-priced archaeological-site tours (per person Dhs150) is a great way to gain a deeper depth of understanding. You can also explore on a mountain bike (from Dhs90 per person) or hiking tour (from Dhs60 per person). All these tours will take you to the main sites. Highlights for history buffs are the Faya Caves, where archaeologists unearthed the earliest evidence of human occupation outside of Africa; the wadi caves and spring where remains of a Neolithic graveyard were uncovered; the circular Bronze Age Umm An Nar tombs; and the foundations of a fort, palace and houses from the settlement here in the pre-Islamic era.Mleiha's position, right on the edge where the beige desert plains give way to yellow and orange dunes, is also prime for adventure activities and the Mleiha visitors centre can organise a full range of dune-driving 4WD excursions (from Dhs90 per person) as well as mountain biking, hiking, horse riding, stargazing and camping activities. If you're peckish after exploring there's a lovely cafe on-site (mains Dhs35 to Dhs80) that does the most delicious, thirst-quenching homemade ginger brew ever.The visitor's centre is just off Hwy E55 in the scrappy town of Maleha, a one-hour drive down Hwy 102 from central Sharjah. If you don't have your own wheels, the centre can arrange transport from Sharjah (Dhs120 return) and Dubai (Dhs220 return)."

Refreshments are available from the public beaches that punctuate the western section of the road.\nThe best way to explore the whole Corniche is by grabbing a bike from the Cyacle bike-share station (www.bikeshare.ae), in front of the Nation Riviera Beach Club at the southwestern end of the Corniche (sign up online or at a station). There are several other stations near the Corniche, including at the World Trade Center, Rayhaan Rotana and Adia HQ. Towels and sunbeds can be hired from several of the Corniche's public beaches. It's worth taking some water for exploring the whole length of the Corniche as the eastern section has few amenities and long stretches without shade.The inland side of the Corniche is dotted with parks that come alive at night with local families seeking the sea breeze in the sweltering summer months (May to September) or clustered around mobile heaters in the cool winter nights (December to February)."

Some of the highlights include Lebanese artist Rafic Charuf's stark 'Palestinian Woman', influential Iraqi artist Kadhim Hayder's 'Fatigued Ten Horses Converse with Nothing', Egyptian artist Zeinab Abd El Hamid's chaotically colourful 'Quartier Populaire' and three works by post-Surrealist Syrian artist Marwan."

Prized for their hunting skills and speed over distance, salukis have for centuries been man's best friend to the Bedouin, and after a visit to this breeding and training centre, it's easy to see why.\nIt neighbours the Abu Dhabi Falcon Hospital so can easily be combined with a tour there.Originating in China, the saluki is thought to be one of the first breeds of dog to be domesticated and their speed, tolerance to high temperatures and intelligence made them the perfect companions for nomadic communities who used them to catch rabbits and other small game. While there's not much call for their skills in the desert these days, they remain a beloved part of the Arabian Peninsula heritage with pure-bred, well-behaved dogs fetching thousands of dirhams. Many are bred to race and, according to the Guinness Book of Records, a saluki holds the record for four-legged speed at 68.8km/h, clocked in 1996. Their beauty is also prized and dogs are paraded before judges for their pride, stride and condition of coat. To see these wonderful, shaggy-eared dogs in action, visit the 10-day Al Dhafra Festival in the deserts of Madinat Zayed in the Western Region of Abu Dhabi Emirate."
