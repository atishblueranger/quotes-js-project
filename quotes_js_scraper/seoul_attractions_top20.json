        "detail_description": "This large and pleasant park was the focus of the 1988 Olympics. Strolling its paths takes you past its stadiums surrounded by plenty of greenery, ponds and open-air sculptures. There's a gallery of modern art and two museums on the history of the Baekje dynasty. The park contains the remains of the Mongchon-toseong (Mongchon Fortress), an earth rampart surrounded by a moat, built in the 3rd century AD during the Baekje dynasty.\nAttractions built for the 1988 Seoul Olympics include the indoor swimming pool, sometimes open to the public, tennis courts, three gymnasiums (gymnasium 1 hosts major concerts) and the velodrome. The latter is now used by punters who gamble on bicycle and even motor-boat races. On Wednesdays and Thursdays between March and December, motor boats race three times round a 600m course at Misari (20km east of Seoul) while gamblers watch the races on screens.Scattered like buckshot around the park are over 200 sculptures, some larger than a house. Designed and made by sculptors from around the world, most of the artwork is puzzling even after reading the artists’ descriptions of their work. Groups picnic among the art and the trees.The bunker-like SOMA has a tempting cafe and shop, a permanent display of Olympics-themed video art by Nam June Paik and five galleries for special exhibitions.The Olympic Museum has screens showing the exciting highlights of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, together with a brief history of the Olympics.Fast food, a convenience store and the excellent Seasons Table are at the World Peace Gate near the main entrance, where rollerbladers glide along on warm evenings and weekends."

        "detail_description": "This vast and imposing concrete slab of a museum takes visitors on a fascinating journey through Korea's past from prehistory all the way to the Korean Empire period (1897–1910). If you're short on time, prioritise the Joseon Dynasty gallery (1392–1897). Among the must-see exhibits in the ground-floor galleries are the Baekje Incense Burner, an extraordinary example of the artistry of the 6th- to 7th-century Baekje Kingdom; and the Golden Treasures from the Great Tomb of Hwangham.\nIn the 3rd-floor sculpture and craft galleries, search out the Pensive Bodhisattva from the 7th century. Also look down on the top of the Goryeo-dynasty Ten Storey Pagoda, carved from marble.Hour-long, English-language tours leave from the Great Hall lobby at 11am and 2pm. If you have a smartphone, get on the free museum wi-fi and download the museum's own app, which also serves as an excellent audioguide, triggered by Bluetooth as you pass exhibits.The surrounding park is best appreciated in good weather, when the Great Hall is perfectly reflected in the large Reflecting Pond. The original Bosingak Bell is in the grounds near the picturesque Dragon Falls.Opposite the museum's main entrance is the Special Exhibition Hall, which hosts blockbuster shows on anything from Renaissance painting to the Silk Road, with tickets costing around ₩10,000. Those interested in Korean language can visit the National Hanguel Museum, which provides an overview of its relatively recent history.Kids don't miss out either with the Children's Museum offering a snapshot of Korean culture with plenty of hands-on features and play spaces.For picnic snacks in the park, there’s a convenience store near the main entrance, as well as several cafes and restaurants in the complex."

        "detail_description": "One of Seoul's five grand palaces built during the Joseon dynasty, Deoksugung (meaning Palace of Virtuous Longevity) is the only one you can visit in the evening and see the buildings illuminated. It first served as a palace in 1593 and is a fascinating mix of traditional Korean and western-style neoclassical structures.The palace’s main gate is the scene of the entertaining changing of the guard ceremony at 11am, 2pm and 3.30pm. Free one-hour guided tours in English start at 10.45am and 1.30pm.\nDeoksugung became a palace in 1593 when King Seonjo moved in after all of Seoul’s other palaces were destroyed during the Japanese invasion. Despite two kings being crowned here, it became a secondary palace from 1615 until 1897 when King Gojong moved in after leaving the nearby Russian legation.Although he was forced by the Japanese to abdicate 10 years later, King Gojong carried on living here in some style until he died in 1919. His son, Sunjong, reigned as a puppet emperor until 1910 when he too was forced to abdicate by the Japanese, who then annexed Korea, bringing the Joseon dynasty to an undignified and abrupt end after more than 500 years.The palace used to be three times as big as it is now, but it still contains small gardens and ponds amid an extraordinary potpourri of contrasting architectural styles.Junghwajeon, the palace’s main throne hall, was used for ceremonial occasions such as coronations, and is adorned with dragons and has golden window frames.Behind it is the grand neoclassical-style Seokjojeon, designed by British architect GR Harding and completed in 1910. Today it houses the Daehan Empire History Museum which displays the mansion's opulent interior. The equally grand western wing was designed by a Japanese architect in 1938. It's now the MMCA Deoksugung, with a collection of permanent and temporary contemporary art.King Gojong’s living quarters, Hamnyeongjeon, was where he died in 1919, an event which sparked off nationwide protests against Japanese rule. Behind is the interesting fusion-style pavilion Jeonggwanheon.The stone mythical creatures in the main courtyard are haetae, which are supposed to protect the palace from fire, but in 1904 they must have fallen asleep – the palace burnt down."

Nearby is the oldest hall, Panjeon, constructed in 1856, which houses over 3000 150-year-old woodblocks with Buddhist scripture and art carved into them.Make an effort to visit on Thursday when monks and volunteers offer the templelife program in English that includes lotus-lantern making, dado (tea ceremony), a temple tour and Seon (Zen) meditation. There's also an opportunity to stay overnight in the two-day templestay program (₩70,000) which includes activities and monastic meals; book three weeks in advance."

There are plenty of tanks, helicopters and planes too, and just to remind you that the war remains unresolved, you can clamber aboard a replica of the patrol boat sunk by North Korean forces in 2002.\nExhibits cover the surprise 4am attack from the North (spearheaded by 240 Russian-made tanks), the build-up of UN (mainly US) forces in Busan, the daring amphibious landing at Incheon, and the sweep north followed by the surprise Chinese attack – all of which took place in 1950.On the 1st floor are paintings and panor­amic displays illustrating many fierce battles fought against invading Mongol, Japanese and Chinese armies. Many items are only vaguely dated, but there is a replica of one of Admiral Sun-sin’s famous iron-clad turtle warships (called geobukseon), which he used to defeat the Japanese navy in the 1590s.Other displays cover Korea’s involvement in the Vietnam War (4700 Koreans died), North Korean attacks on the South since 1953, and Korea’s UN peacekeeping roles.It takes around three hours to browse the whole place, so arrive before 3pm. There are free one-hour tours at 10am and 2pm daily.There's also a children's museum outside, presenting the history of war in Korea with an introduction to national war heroes of old and a 'training ground' play area."

You can then take your seafood to several restaurants within the market who will either serve it up to you with a variety of side dishes (usually around ₩3000 person), or prepare and cook it (starting from an extra ₩5000 depending on what you have). A good one is Busan Ilbeonji."

        "detail_description": "This 6.3km park, named for the former Gyeongui Line (on which it was built), is a narrow, long green space that runs along the discarded railroad tracks above Gajwa Station to Hyochang Park station. Within are nooks for reading, grassy picnic areas, exercise equipment and more.\nThe Gyeongui Line was built by the Japanese in 1905 and abandoned in the early 1950s. Since the park opened in 2016, many restaurants, cafes and bars in its bordering regions have surfaced. Parts of the park are themed: for instance, Yeonnam-dong (next to Hongik University Station exit 3), nicknamed Yeontral Park because of its Central Park–like atmosphere, is popular for picnics (albeit on uncomfortable artificial grass) and is also a great place to grab a beer (available at several nearby craft-beer marts), people-watch and enjoy the warm weather on a nice day or night. The area between Hongik University station and Sinchon is known as Gyeongui Line Book Street, with train-carriage-like bookshops."

        "detail_description": "Even longtime residents of Itaewon might be surprised if you tell them that it is indeed possible to find historical relics in the heart of the neighbourhood. Located atop a hill directly facing N Seoul Tower is the Bugundang Shrine, which dates back to 1619 but was moved here from Namsan in 1917.\nAlthough the shrine building itself is only open twice a year, the park offers stunning views of the Yongsan area, Namsan Mountain and N Seoul Tower, making it a great spot for sunset-viewing. There's also a monument dedicated to Ryu Gwan-sun, a female Christian freedom fighter who died while imprisoned by the Japanese aged just 17."

It is a modern reinterpretation of traditional Korean design; the cresting wave provides shade (like the curved eaves found on palaces and temple roofs in Korea) over the handsome old City Hall, which was built from stone in 1926 and is now a library.\nInside is the impressive Green Wall, a vertical garden ascending seven floors and covering 1516m2, making it formerly the largest in the world according to Guinness World Records in 2013.Alongside it are the twisted white balloons of art installation 'Metaseosa Seobeol', interpreting the capital's 2000-year turbulent history through a play of light and form to symbolise hope and myth.Don't miss riding the glass elevator for an even closer look at these City Hall installations. On the 8th floor is the Sky Plaza Gallery with photo and art exhibitions."

Seoullo 7017 provides an interesting, airy (though sun-exposed) view of the city centre, its highways and architecture. Cross-country locomotives snake across a web of train tracks, then at night the old Seoul Station glows and the overpass itself is lit up in moody colours.\nThe overpass was built in 1970, but in 2014 it was deemed unfit for automobiles and the 17m-high road was refitted as a green space for pedestrians based on the High Line in New York. Seoullo (sounding like 'Seoul Road' in English) opened in 2017, giving meaning to the numbers 7017 alongside the original build year.A handful of cafes and galleries are located along its length and there are sometimes art exhibitions, concerts, and activities for kids, including trampolines. Free day and night walking tours of the park are provided by the Seoul city government; reserve at www.visitseoul.net.Seoullo 7017 can be entered from various points, starting on Toegye-ro at Nomdaemun Market gate 5 (which is also Hoehyeon station, Exit 5), where there is a dedicated information booth with maps. The midpoint entrance is at Seoul Station, Exit 8 and the overpass ends just after Cheongpa-ro."
