        "detail_description": "Hyderabad's most impressive sight, this monumental fort lies on the western edge of town. In the 16th century the Qutb Shahs made Golconda a fortified citadel, built atop a 120m-high granite hill surrounded by mighty ramparts, all ringed by further necklaces of crenellated fortifications, 11km in perimeter. From the summit there are stunning vistas across dusty Deccan foothills and the crumbling outer ramparts, over the domed tombs of Qutb Shahs, past distant shanty towns to the horizon haze of the inner city.\nBy the time of the Qutb Shahs, Golconda Fort had already existed for at least three centuries under the Kakatiyas and Bahmani sultanate, and was already famed for its diamonds, which were mostly mined in the Krishna River valley, but cut and traded here. The Qutb Shahs moved to their new city of Hyderabad in 1591, but maintained Golconda as a citadel until the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb took it in 1687 after a year-long siege, ending Qutb Shahi rule.Golconda's massive gates were studded with iron spikes to obstruct war elephants. Within the fort, a series of concealed glazed earthenware pipes ensured a reliable water supply, while the ingenious acoustics guaranteed that even the smallest sound from the entrance would echo across the fort complex.Allow at least a couple of hours to explore the site. Guides charge around ₹600 per 90-minute tour. Small ₹20 guide booklets are also available. Inside the citadel gate, an anticlockwise circuit leads through gardens and up past mostly minor buildings to the top of the hill, where you'll find the functioning Hindu Jagadamba Mahakali Temple and the three-storey durbar hall, with fine panoramas. You then descend to the old palace buildings in the southeastern part of the fort and return to the entrance, passing the elegant three-arched Taramati Mosque.Golconda is about 10km west from Abids or Charminar: an Uber cab or auto is around ₹270 one way. Buses 65G and 66G run from Charminar to Golconda via GPO Abids hourly; the journey takes about an hour."

The displays, lighting and information could be improved, but it's still a worthwhile visit.\nIn 2018 a diamond-studded gold tiffin box that once belonged to Mir Osman Ali Khan, the last Nizam of Hyderabad, was stolen from the museum.

Work is ongoing to restore the building to its former glory, a project that will take many years to accomplish. There's no official access but Detours can usually gain entry for those booking one of its fascinating White Mughal tours.\nKirkpatrick became enchanted by Hyderabad courtly culture, converted to Islam and married Khair-un-Nissa, a teenage relative of the Hyderabad prime minister. The Residency and its extensive gardens became the Osmania University College for Women, known as Koti Women's College, in 1949. Beyond the grand classical portico is the Durbar Hall, with Islamic geometric designs on its high ceiling above the chandeliers and classical columns, and an elaborate curving staircase behind. In the overgrown gardens to the southwest you'll find a British cemetery, the surviving entrance to the Residency's zenana (women's quarters) and a model of the Residency building made by Kirkpatrick for Khair-un-Nissa.Dalrymple visited the building in the late 1990s, when it was near-derelict. But after the publication of White Mughals brought attention to the Residency, an anonymous donor gave £1 million towards restoring the structure. Work finally began in 2013, directed by the World Monuments Fund and State of Telangana. The first phase of renovation was completed in 2017; the plan is to eventually convert the structure into a cultural centre."

Other tombs contain minor royalty, as well as physicians, courtesans and nobility. The first restoration phase was completed in 2018, and the complex has now been nominated to become a World Heritage Site. An exhibition near the entrance provides helpful explanatory information. The tombs are about 2km from Golconda Fort, ₹30 by autorickshaw or Uber/Ola cab."

You can climb to the 1st floor for a view of the district. The 2nd floor, home to Hyderabad’s oldest mosque, and the upper columns, are not open to the public. The structure is illuminated from 7pm to 9pm."
