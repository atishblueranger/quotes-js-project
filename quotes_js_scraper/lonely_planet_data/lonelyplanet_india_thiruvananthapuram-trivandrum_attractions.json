The main entrance is through the 30m-tall, seven-tier eastern gopuram (gateway tower), in Tamil Nadu style. In the inner sanctum, Padmanabha (a manifestation of Vishnu) reclines on the sacred serpent and is made from over 10,000 saligrams (sacred stones) purportedly transported from Nepal by elephant.\nA treasure stash with an estimated value of US$1 trillion was unearthed in a series of previously locked vaults beneath the temple in 2011, making it India's richest temple. The path around to the right of the eastern gate offers good views of the gopuram."
