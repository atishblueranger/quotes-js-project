Plane trees don't usually live for more than 200 years, though in all fairness this is certainly one of Europe's oldest. This once-magnificent tree is held up with scaffolding, and looks to be in its death throes.\n"

Although not advertised, listening devices have invaluable recorded information and relate to numbered exhibits.\nYou can visit all the rooms surrounding three inner courtyards; the mosaics from 3rd century AD are particularly beautiful."

Nearby, there's a section of the Decumanus Maximus, the Roman city’s main thoroughfare. The site also holds the Nymphaeum, a columned structure that was actually a public toilet.\nThere's also the Xysto, a cluster of Doric columns, and the Temple of Dionysos, dating from the 2nd century BC. Across the street stands the Odeion, an impressive 2nd-century Roman theatre, which was built on the site of an even older Greek predecessor, and once seated around 750 spectators. In summer, performances are sometimes held here. Just east of here is the cleverly reconstructed Casa Romana."
