At First Basin there’s a free (chilly) outdoor swimming pool (November to March), the world’s longest single-span chairlift (adult/child one way $13/8; 9am to 5.30pm, to 4.30pm in winter) and Victorian-era gardens where peacocks strut. Elsewhere there are walking tracks and various lookouts. Eating options include a cafe and the Gorge Restaurant.\nTwo walking tracks straddle the gorgeous gorge (Cataract Walk is level; the Zig Zag Track is steep), leading from Kings Bridge up to First Basin. You can also drive to the First Basin car park – follow the signs from York St to Hillside Cres, Brougham St and Basin Rd.Just upstream from First Basin is the Alexandra Suspension Bridge, from where another walking track (45 minutes one way) heads further up the gorge to Duck Reach, the earliest municipal hydroelectric power station in Australia (1895).You can also explore the gorge on a guided walk or a boat trip with Tamar River Cruises."

Arrayed across three underground levels, the $75-million museum created by local philanthropist-owner David Walsh mixes ancient antiquities among contemporary artworks. It's sexy, provocative, disturbing and deeply engaging – don't miss it.To get here, catch the MONA ferry (return standard/posh $22/55) or MONA Roma shuttle bus ($22) from Hobart’s Brooke St Pier.\nAlso at MONA is the cellar door for Moorilla, a winery established here in 1958. Duck in for a wine or Moo Brew beer tasting, or have lunch at the outstanding adjoining restaurant, the Source. You can also catch a summer concert on the lawns, grab a more casual feed at the bar-restaurant inside the museum's new Faro wing, or maybe splash out on a night in the uber-swish Pavilions.MONA is the driving force behind Launceston's annual MONA FOMA arts and music festival, and Hobart's disquieting Dark MOFO winter festival. At the end of 2018, MONA also unveiled plans for a striking new five-star hotel – Motown – on the premises; it's expected to open in 2024."

Mountain bikers come for the North South Track, descending from the Springs to Glenorchy, while you can also coast down the sealed summit road on a bike with Mt Wellington Descent. The Hobart Shuttle Bus Company also runs daily two-hour tours to the summit.\nHacked out of the mountainside during the Great Depression, the summit road winds up from Fern Tree through thick temperate forest, opening out to lunar rockscapes near the summit. If you don’t have wheels, local buses 448 (weekdays) and 449 (weekends and weekday evenings) stop halfway up the hill at Fern Tree, from where it’s a five- to six-hour return walk to the top via Fern Glade Track, Radfords Track, Pinnacle Track and then the steep Zig Zag Track. The Organ Pipes walk from the Chalet (en route to the summit) is a flat track below these dolerite cliffs.Download a series of walking and mountain biking maps and brochures at www.wellingtonpark.org.au/maps, or pick up the detailed Wellington Park Recreation Map ($11.95) from the visitor information centre or Service Tasmania."

Spin around picturesque Arthur Circus, refuel in Hampden Rd's cafes, then ogle St George’s Anglican Church – the tower was designed by a convict architect.\nArchitectural styles here reflect the original occupants’ varying jobs (and salaries), ranging from one- and two-room fishermen’s cottages to the lace-adorned mansions of merchants and master mariners. Many houses are still occupied by Hobartians, and some are now guesthouses where you can stay (usually for a pretty penny) and absorb the village atmosphere. For a fortifying stout, duck into the historic Shipwright’s Arms Hotel.For an interesting guided walking tour of Battery Point, download the free booklet at www.batterypointwalk.com.au."

Dating back to the whaling days of the 1830s, Salamanca Pl was then the waterfront – goods were winched from the upper levels of the warehouses directly onto ships. By the mid-20th century many of the warehouses had fallen into ruin, before restorations began in the 1970s. These days Salamanca hosts myriad restaurants, cafes, bars and shops, and the unmissable Saturday Salamanca Market.\nBehind the warehouses, Salamanca Sq fills an old quarry, while at the eastern end of Salamanca Pl, the conversion of four old wheat silos into plush apartments has also been a hit.Operating behind the scenes is a vibrant and creative arts community. The nonprofit Salamanca Arts Centre occupies seven Salamanca warehouses, home to around 60 arts organisations and individuals, including shops, galleries, studios, performing-arts venues and versatile public spaces. Check the website for happenings.To reach Salamanca from Battery Point, descend the weathered 1840 Kelly’s Steps, wedged between warehouses just east of Salamanca Sq."
