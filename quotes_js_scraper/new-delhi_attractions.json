    "detail_description": "This magnificent white-marble gurdwara (Sikh temple), topped by glinting golden onion domes, was constructed at the site where the eighth Sikh guru, Harkrishan Dev, stayed before his 1664 death. Despite his tender years, the six-year-old guru tended to victims of Delhi’s cholera and smallpox epidemic, and the waters of the large tank are said to have healing powers. It's full of colour and life, yet tranquil, and live devotional songs waft over the compound.\nAs at all gurdwaras, free meals are served to pilgrims daily. Just inside the entrance to the complex is a small museum, chronicling the history of Sikhism and its gurus and martyrs."

    "detail_description": "Occupying the presidential garages, this swish museum has a mix of fairly modern displays, including 3D images of presidential speeches, plus former presidential vehicles, such as a Mercedes given to Rajiv Gandhi by the King of Jordan, and three 100-year-old horse-drawn carriages. In the basement is an impressive collection of oil portraits of former viceroys, governors general and British monarchs.\nOpposite, in the former presidential stables, is a more old-fashioned collection of gifts given to former presidents by visiting dignitaries. You must pre-book your visit online, paying in advance as you do so."

    "detail_description": "In the residence of controversial former prime minister Indira Gandhi is this interesting museum devoted to her life and her political-heavyweight family. It displays her personal effects, including the blood-stained sari she was wearing when she was assassinated in 1984; in the back garden a glass-covered pathway traces her final steps before she was shot and killed by two security guards. Many rooms in the house are preserved as they were, providing a window into the family's life.\nAn exhibit at the rear charts the life of Indira’s son, Rajiv, who met a similarly violent end when he was assassinated in 1991."

    "detail_description": "Firozabad, the fifth city of Delhi, was built by Feroz Shah Tughlaq in 1354, the first city here to be built on the river. Only the fortress remains, with crumbling walls protecting the Jama Masjid (Friday mosque), a baoli (step-well), and the pyramid-like Hawa Mahal, topped by a 13m-high sandstone Ashoka Pillar inscribed with 3rd-century-BC Buddhist edicts. There’s an otherworldly atmosphere to the ruins.\nEntrance is free after 2pm every Thursday when crowds gather at the mosque and other points of importance to light candles and incense and leave bowls of milk to appease Delhi’s djinns (invisible spirits), who are said to occupy the underground chambers beneath the ruins.Shoes should be removed when entering the mosque and Hawa Mahal."

    "detail_description": "This glorious, if dusty, museum is full of treasures. Mind-bogglingly ancient, sophisticated figurines from the Harappan civilisation, almost 5000 years old, include the remarkable Dancing Girl, and there are also some fine ceramics from the even-older Nal civilisation. Other items include Buddha relics, exquisite jewellery, miniature paintings, medieval woodcarvings, textiles and musical instruments. Don't miss the immense, five-tier wooden temple chariot built in South India in the 19th century.\nAllow at least two hours for a proper visit. Bring your passport to obtain an audio guide (included in the foreigner ticket price; ₹150 extra for Indian tourists). There's also a cheap-as-chips cafe inside the museum gates and round to the left. You don't have to visit the museum to use the cafe; handy because eating options are limited round here."

    "detail_description": "On the banks of the Yamuna River, this peaceful, very well maintained park contains a simple black-marble platform marking the spot where Mahatma Gandhi was cremated following his assassination in 1948. This memorial is a thought-provoking spot, inscribed with what are said to have been Gandhi’s final words, Hai Ram ('Oh, God'). Every Friday (the day he died) commemorative prayers are held here at 5pm, as well as on 2 October and 30 January, his birth and death anniversaries.\nDespite being perfect picnic territory, you're not allowed to bring food into the park, and there's nowhere to buy any once inside. Further north you'll find memorials commemorating where Jawaharlal Nehru, Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi were cremated.South from Raj Ghat, just across Kisan Ghat Rd, are some equally peaceful landscaped gardens containing Gandhi Darshan, a pavilion displaying photos relating to the Mahatma."

Today they mainly harbour brash, largely interchangeable but popular, bars, and international chain stores, plus a few good hotels and restaurants. Touts are rampant.\n"

The exhibits include film footage, modern art, and rooms preserved just as Gandhi left them. The small clothes shop within the grounds sells garments made from khadi, homespun cotton that was championed by Gandhi during the Independence movement.\n"

    "detail_description": "Rajpath (Kingsway) is a vast parade linking India Gate to the offices of the Indian government. Built on an imperial scale between 1914 and 1931, it was designed by Edwin Lutyens and Herbert Baker and underlined the ascendance of the British rulers. Yet just 16 years later, the Brits were out on their ear and Indian politicians were pacing the corridors of power.\nAt the western end of Rajpath the official residence of the president of India, Rashtrapati Bhavan, now partially open to the public via guided tour, is flanked by the mirror-image, dome-crowned North Secretariat and South Secretariat. These house government ministries and are not open to the public. The Indian parliament meets nearby at the Sansad Bhavan, a circular, colonnaded edifice at the end of Sansad Marg, also not open to the public.At Rajpath’s eastern end is mighty India Gate. This 42m-high stone memorial arch, designed by Lutyens, pays tribute to around 90,000 Indian Army soldiers who died in WWI, the Northwest Frontier operations and the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War."
