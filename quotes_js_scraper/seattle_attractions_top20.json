The paths that wind around the lake are usually well used by those on foot and wheels of every variety, and make for some of the best people- (and dog-) watching in the city.\nIn the early 1900s, city planners lowered the lake’s water level by 7ft, increasing the shoreline to preserve parkland around the lake. After the lowering, however, Ravenna Creek, which once fed the lake, no longer flowed through. Green Lake became stagnant and filled with stinky green algae. Massive dredging efforts to keep it navigable continue, although the lake remains prone to algae blooms."

This is one of Seattle's top stops for kids, and one of the top sights in the city.\n\n  \nThe Museum of flight is the the largest private air and space museum in the world ©Elena_Suvorova / Shutterstock\n\nTaking off at the Museum of Flight\nIt shouldn't be entirely surprising to find such an impressive aviation museum in Seattle – this is, after all, the home of Boeing, founded here by William E Boeing in 1916. Get ready for an exciting jet-propelled journey through war, peace, space rockets and inspired engineering. The story of how we got from the Wright Brothers to the first moon landing in less than 66 years is powerfully told using film, photos, audio, words, flight simulators, and of course, a wonderful collection of flying machines.\nAircraft large and small are crammed into the museum's hangars, from a ginormous Boeing 747 and a decommissioned Concorde to the tiny Caproni Ca 20, the first ever fighter plane, built during WWI. You can get within touching distance of a Lockheed Model 10-E Electra, the same model plane that Emelia Earhart was flying when she vanished over the Pacific, and walk through the Boeing VC-137B that was the first presidential jet to use the call sign 'Air Force One'.\nSome aircraft are originals, some are reproductions – including most of the exhibits from the space age – but they all contribute to an evocative journey through the history of man's quest to take to the air. Look out for such oddities as Paul MacCready's Gossamer Albatross, which crossed the English Channel by pedal power in 1979, and Aerocar International's Aerocar, designed for both the airways and the highway.\nPlenty of displays cover the work of William E Boeing, the former lumber mogul who founded the Boeing aircraft company, transforming the world of travel, and the city of Seattle, in the process. The hangar known as the Red Barn was Boeing's original production facility, producing wood-framed, fabric covered aircraft in the first half of the 20th century.\n\n  \nThe Seattle Museum of Flight covers everything from fighter jets to helicopters ©Norman Ong / Shutterstock\n\nTickets &amp; Practicalities\nIt's worth buying tickets ahead of time to make sure you get in, as availability can be limited on the day, and there's heavy demand from school groups. The museum has plenty of parking, which is handy, as driving is the easiest way to reach the museum (Metro bus 124 also runs here from downtown). Pilots can also come by air – the museum has landing space for up to five light aircraft daily!\n"

The college was originally located in downtown on a 10-acre site now occupied by the Fifth Avenue Theater (the university still owns the land), but with both university and city outgrowing their initial confines, a new site was sought in 1895.\nThe present-day 700-acre campus that sits at the edge of Lake Union about 3 miles northeast of downtown is flecked with stately trees and beautiful architecture, and affords wondrous views of Mt Rainier framed by fountains and foliage. Roughly 47,000 students and 22,000 staff enjoy the noble setting, making 'U Dub' easily the largest university in the state. The core of the campus is Central Plaza. Close by you can pick up information and a campus map at the visitor center.The university is ideal for gentle strolls, people-watching and lung-stretching exercise on the Burke-Gilman Trail. The campus also hosts two decent museums, fine sports facilities, a theater, a library, and a student-union building where leaflet-filled noticeboards advertise the kinds of outré, spontaneous events that typically color student life."

        "detail_description": "The architecturally minded will be interested in the University of Washington’s Suzzallo Library. Designed by Carl Gould in 1926, this bibliophile’s dream was inspired by Henry Suzzallo, UW’s president at the time. Suzzallo wanted it to look like a cathedral, because ‘the library is the soul of the university.' Unfortunately for him, his bosses disagreed; on reviewing the building, they deemed it too expensive and fired Suzzallo for his extravagance.\nHowever, the dream was partially realized in the grand neo-Gothic entrance lobby and the truly beguiling reading room with its massive cathedral-like windows that, on fine days, cast filtered sunlight onto the long reading pews. Hours change with the school year, so it's best to check ahead before visiting if you're interested in peeking inside."

In 2009 the building was purchased and saved from demolition by an organization called Historic Seattle, which embarked on an ongoing restoration project. It's currently home to a number of community organizations, a politically minded coffee shop and event spaces.\nVisit the Facebook page for an event schedule (www.facebook.com/WashingtonHall)."

In clear weather the views of Mt Rainier are fantastic. Swimming is only for hardy souls, however, as the water is icy cold, even in summer. Further south, past the yacht moorage, is Leschi Park, a grassy green space with a children’s play area.\nThere are lifeguards on duty late May to late August (2pm to 7pm Monday to Friday, from 11am Saturday and Sunday late May to late June, noon to 7pm Monday to Friday, from 11am Saturday and Sunday late June to late August)."
