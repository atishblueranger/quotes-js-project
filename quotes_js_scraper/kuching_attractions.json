    "detail_description": "Housed in a ‘colonial Baroque’–style building constructed in 1909, this museum displays some superb examples of traditional Sarawakian textiles, including Malay songket (gold brocade cloth), as well as the hats, mats, belts, basketwork, beadwork, silver work, bark work, bangles and ceremonial headdresses created by the Iban, Bidayuh, Penan and other Dayak groups. Dioramas recreate the sartorial exuberance of Orang Ulu, Malay, Chinese and Indian weddings. Explanatory panels shed light on materials and techniques.\n"

It's a fine place for a stroll any time a cool breeze blows off the river, especially at sunset. In the evening the waterfront is ablaze with fairy lights and buzzing with people as tambang (small ferries) glide past with their glowing lanterns. The views across to the Astana, State Assembly, Darul Hana Bridge and musical fountain are mesmerising.\nSunset river cruises (RM20) are a popular way to experience Kuching's waterfront. The water level is kept constant by a downstream barrage."

It's open every day, but the main event is the larger weekend market that begins around midday on Saturday, when folk, some from rural longhouses, arrive with fruit, vegetables, fish and spices.\nThe air is heady with the aromas of fresh coriander, ginger, herbs and jungle ferns, which are displayed among piles of bananas, mangoes, custard apples and obscure jungle fruit. If you smell something overpoweringly sickly-sweet and pungent, chances are it’s a durian. Vendors are friendly and many are happy to tell you about their wares, which are often divided into quantities worth RM1 or RM2."

There's usually someone sitting outside the mosque keeping an eye on things. If you would like to go inside, ask permission and they will probably offer to show you around. Women will be given a long cloak and headscarf to wear."

A highlight of the historic old building are the two colonial cannons protecting the entrance.\nOver recent decades the museum has focused more on ethnological displays about Borneo's incredibly rich indigenous cultures – including a full-size Iban longhouse – but it is envisaged that in future the museum will restore many natural-history details and exhibition highlights from its heyday a century ago."
