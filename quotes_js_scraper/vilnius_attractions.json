    "detail_description": "Stately Vilnius Cathedral, divorced from its freestanding belfry, is a national symbol and the city's most instantly recognisable building. Known in full as the Cathedral of St Stanislav and St Vladislav, this columned neoclassical cathedral occupies a spot originally used for the worship of Perkūnas, the Lithuanian thunder god.Register in advance to tour the crypts, the final resting place of many prominent Lithuanians including Vytautas the Great (1350–1430).\nThe first wooden cathedral was built here between 1387 and 1388; after several episodes of destruction and reconstruction, the present edifice was erected in the late 18th century. Note the greyish stone on the exterior, showing the older parts of the building.The reconstruction followed the original Gothic floor plan and incorporated St Casimir's and the Valavičius family chapels in the late 18th century. St Casimir’s Chapel, with its baroque cupola, coloured marble and frescoes of the saint's life, is the cathedral's showpiece.From 1950 the Soviets used the cathedral as a warehouse, gallery and concert venue, before its reconsecration in 1989."

The current crosses replace three bulldozed by the Soviets; their twisted remains can be seen below the current set. Walk up the hill from T Kosciuskos gatvė, and enjoy fabulous views of the city, particularly good here at sunset.\n"

For most visitors, the highlight is the 360-degree panorama of Vilnius from the roof.\nThe original tower was a tier higher than the 20m structure that marks the spot today. Its walls were ruined during the Russian occupation (1655–61), but it was restored in 1930 to house the museum."

The highlight is the colourful folk traditions room, replete with floral-decorated furnishings, linens and carved wooden crosses.\nThe museum builds on the collections compiled by the Museum of Antiquities since 1855 and also features collections devoted to numismatics (including some of the very first Lithuanian coins) and burial traditions.A statue of Mindaugas, Lithuania's sole king, has stood guard over the entrance since 2003."

Those killed by Soviet special forces on 13 January 1991 are memorialised by a sculpture of the Madonna. A taxi or Bolt service from the train station costs around €6.\nAnother memorial honours Napoleonic soldiers who died of starvation and injuries in Vilnius while retreating from the Russian army. The remains of 2000 of them were only found in 2002.Hundreds of Polish soldiers’ graves, including many unknown soldiers, are also located here. Former president Algirdas Brazauskas’s grave is a bit abandoned atop a hill slope, in a newer area of the cemetery."

Most unsettling is the descent to the prison cells, and one especially padded to muffle sounds coming from within.\nBetween 1944 and the 1960s, more than 1000 prisoners were shot or stabbed in the skull here.

The baroque palace, built for the 17th-century grand dukes, has been faithfully revamped to house an atmospheric museum of art and history. Visitors with several hours can opt for full admission, accessing four 'routes' through Lithuanian history; otherwise choose one or two.\nRoute I walks you through two millennia of Lithuanian history. Guided through the strata of the palace's foundations, visitors can see the bones of successive episodes in the history of the building and the nation. A second route explores the splendidly reconstructed ceremonial halls of the grand duchy, complete with the crimson velvet of the throne room and remarkable wooden ceilings, while routes three and four take you through a thicket of halberds and swords dating back to the time of the grand dukes. This gleaming white complex is a potent symbol of revitalised, independent Lithuania."
