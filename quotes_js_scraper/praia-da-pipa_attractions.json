    "detail_description": "This small, privately owned reserve, 2km west along the main road from the town center, does a valuable job of protecting at least some of the Pipa coast from development. Well-marked trails lead through secondary forest to impressive lookouts over Baía dos Golfinhos and Praia do Madeiro, from which you can often see large green turtles at high tide.\nA leisurely stroll through the reserve takes two to 2½ hours and you can access Praia do Madeiro via some steps at the northwest end in order to cool off."
