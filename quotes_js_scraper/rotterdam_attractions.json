    "detail_description": "Designed and built between 1925 and 1931, this modernist World Heritage–listed factory northwest of the city centre is an icon of 20th-century industrial architecture. Often described as a 'glass palace' (it's largely constructed of steel and glass), it functioned as a state-of-the-art coffee, tea and tobacco factory until the 1990s and now houses creative industries. Though closed to the public, the factory sometimes offers guided tours on weekends at 1pm (adult/child under 13 years €8.50/5); check the factory website for details. Urban Guides also runs one-hour guided tours (€15 per person) at noon on most Saturdays and Sundays (book ahead).\nThe Urban Guides tours have access to some, but not all, parts of the factory, peeking into the management building and then crossing to the factory's electricity plant (the second built in Rotterdam) on one of the building's distinctive diagonal bridges. The tour ends in the tobacco factory, which has light-drenched spaces where workers toiled, twin stairways (one each for male and female workers, so as to prevent fraternisation) and a large cafeteria.At the time of research, architecture-focused De Rotterdam Tours was considering adding a dedicated tour of the factory to its program. An on-site information centre at the factory is scheduled to open in November 2018.The orange-and-blue low bunker to the east of the factory is the De Schie Penitentiary, designed by CJM Weeber and constructed between 1985 and 1989. Its startlingly vivid colour scheme is in stark contrast to its dark function."

    "detail_description": "One of the highest windmills in the world, the 'Mill of the Whale' dates from 1794 and was rebuilt in 1996 after a fire. Built to grind malt for the gin industry, it now functions as a museum, with exhibits explaining the milling process and a video presentation about the Netherlands' 1200 windmills (a third of which still work). A downstairs shop sells flours milled at De Vrijheid mill, the only one of Schiedam's seven historic mills still functioning.\nThe combined entrance ticket to the mill and National Jenevermuseum Schiedam can be purchased at either venue."

There are always at least three exhibitions to visit – from painting to photography, fashion to graphic design – and these are spread across the architecturally notable multifloored building, which abuts a dyke embankment and was designed in 1988–89 by Rem Koolhaas and Fuminori Hoshino from local firm OMA.\nThe Kunsthal was the victim of a major theft in 2012 when several masterpieces by Monet and Matisse, among others, were stolen (they are still missing)."

In 1850, when the industry was at its height, there were hundreds of businesses distilling malt wine and adding juniper to produce this liquor, which was shipped all over the world. The distillery's huge bins, cooling vessels and copper distilling kettles are still here, as are a number of upstairs exhibits about jenever--making.\nThe entrance ticket includes an explanation about the jenever-making process in the ground-floor branderij where barley and rye are still malted. These occur on Tuesday, Friday and Saturday at 1.30pm, 2.30pm and 3.30pm, and on Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday at 2.30pm and 3.30pm. To visit the branderij without visiting the museum costs €5. A tasting of three jenevers costs €4.50.The combined entrance ticket to the museum and the Korenmolen de Walvisch can be purchased at either venue."

    "detail_description": "Good things often come in small packages, and so it is with this small but excellent museum sheltered under a bridge on the Coolhaven. An eight-minute immersive multimedia experience outlines the terror and destruction caused by the bombing of Rotterdam on 14 May 1940, when 54 German aircraft dropped 1300 bombs on the city over a 13-minute period. Artefact-driven displays focus on all aspects of the wartime experience, interspersing tales of optimism and bravery among many sad stories.\nTopics addressed in the well-labelled displays include the great fire that followed the bombing, the treatment of Rotterdam's Jewish community, the equally destructive Allied bombings of 1943 and the liberation of the city by Canadian troops on 8 May 1945. A thought-provoking and depressing display in the foyer reminds visitors that many other cities have undergone experiences such as Rotterdam's in recent times.During Dutch school holidays, the museum is open 10am to 5pm Tuesday to Friday as well as weekends; check the website for holiday dates."

Working with Johannes Brinkman, Van der Vlugt designed a streamlined, state-of-the-art building that was hailed as an outstanding example of Dutch Functionalism as soon as its construction was completed in 1933. Replete with original fittings and furniture, it can now be visited with a fascinating audiotour.\nThis is an impressive house museum enhanced by an extremely informative multilanguage audiotour that discusses the history of the building and its occupants, and offers plenty of opportunities to drill down into facts about furnishings, appliances and building techniques. Walking through the house, it is easy to imagine what life must have been like for the Sonneveld family and their servants. Tickets include entry to the nearby Het Nieuwe Instituut (and vice versa)."
